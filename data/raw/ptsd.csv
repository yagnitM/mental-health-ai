(I've suspected I have it for a while but was officially told so by a trauma therapist for the first time yesterday)

I'm really nervous to start therapy. We're about to actually get into it and I can feel in my bones that it will shake things up. I've been incredibly stuck/stagnant for my entire adult life basically.",1755220725.0,14,14,ptsd,ptsd
1mqc2mv,Anyone else just want to be left alone most of the time?,"I was diagnosed with PTSD two years ago, but a traumatic event that I went through just a couple of months ago was by far the worst I’ve experienced. I feel like I’ve gone completely backwards in my healing. I’ve noticed ever since this happened, I’m very easily agitated and frustrated by the smallest things. The biggest issue for me right now is that I have horrendous anxiety and want to be left alone 99% of the time. I had to temporarily move back in with my parents, also had to leave my job, and it feels like they *constantly* want to talk to me, even though they know I’m frustrated with it. I feel so annoyed. I’m trying to be respectful but I just want more space. I often catch myself trying really hard to not be snippy with them, but I am so tired of having a conversation or pretending like I’m fine just so they don’t keep hounding me.

1mqiawc,How to be able to wash myself properly and do my beauty routine again?,"I’m a little embarrassed and hopeless. I’m seeing a counselor right now for long-term care and healing. I don’t feel ready to do EMDR yet because the incident is too painful to fully bring up and process at this moment, so I’m just doing talk therapy. 

I was raped over 6 months ago and am having a hard time taking care of myself. It’s been a couple days since I’ve bathed and I absolutely need to tonight, for a couple reasons besides my health and wellbeing. My work’s having a community event tomorrow and I need to look my best, and I sweat so much due to my PTSD that I have to get clean often. I’ve been having a really hard time though and some days I just can’t be naked at all. I stopped taking showers and switched to baths because the constant stimulation of the water hitting my skin upsets me. If I get to the point where I can be naked and start to enter the tub, I have physical symptoms of panic (tight chest, veins in hands and feet showing) and cannot breathe at all. I become somewhat normal when my temperature’s regulated in the water, but I don’t look down at my body at all. I rush and try to keep the bath under 10 minutes. 

I went into the bathroom today and almost took my shirt off, but I stopped and ran back into my room. I’m having trouble breathing now and the sweats are back. I absolutely have to take a bath tonight. Baby wipes as a substitute are off the table because my hair needs to be washed. I just need to feel safe and without shame. 

The way I wash myself these days is with a loofah on a stick because I can’t handle hands on me (even my own), so that’s a start. It’s just impossible for me to get naked and stay that way for more than 5 minutes right now. Besides washing myself, I have to put makeup on and do my hair tomorrow for the event, which I also dread. Looking in the mirror is tough: I don’t want reminders of what he did to me in my eyes and the new dullness of my skin. My eye bags are terrible these days. The cortisol has made me gain weight. I’m not proud of my womanly body at all. 

Anyways, how can I build the courage to go in the bathroom and do it + take the time to do my beauty routine? This might sound juvenile but it’s very real and debilitating. Thanks.  ",1755217613.0,5,6,ptsd,ptsd
1mq6vn3,It happened. I got fired. I hate living with this...,"Hey all. I few months ago I made my first post in here talking about my fear of being fired at work. (I am a hairstylist, was working for a franchise)

Well. Thats finally what happened yesterday. I am so fucking heartbroken and hopeless. 

I had gotten 6 write ups in 6 months of being there. Every. Single. One. Was about attendance. Their only complaint about me. I was an amazing employee otherwise. (their words) I had gone several months without medication because I was out of work and didn't have insurance. I FINALLY made it to where my job gave me insurance, and I JUST got back on meds and into therapy last month. I was finally feeling like I was making progress. 

For context, sleep and mornings are really really hard for me. I have night terrors all night, every night. It takes me awhile to snap out of it and keep going. Thats why I was always late. Sometimes, yes I would call in if it was very bad. My manager knew what was going on. Upper management even made ""accommodations"" to my schedule to help. 

The last straw was Monday. Management came in at the start of my shift and *demoted* me. Made me part time, pay cut, and no benefits. Literally the first thing that day. That obviously was very upsetting, and sent me spiraling about how I can afford bills now, and how I can't afford doctors and medication without insurance. I was having a panic attack and sobbing. I went out to my car and let my manager know. I could not calm down. So I called my counselor, and I was advised to go home so I wasn't a danger to myself. So I did. I gave work a note from my counselor about it as well. 

THE NEXT DAY I COME IN... management is there again. Heart starts racing. I'm asked into the office... and I'm being told I am being terminated for leaving early Monday. I say, ""but my counselor advised me to"" and she said, ""doesn't matter. You still left after I just demoted you for attendance. You are terminated.""

Thank you for reading this far. Is anyone else as disgusted as I am? Has anyone been through anything similar?? I am just feeling deep and profound sadness and embarrassment over this. I LOVED MY JOB!!! My next therapy appointment isnt until Tuesday... so please. Help with some kind words and encouragement. I feel like no one ever truly understands what I am going through in my head. ",1755191863.0,22,19,ptsd,ptsd

1mqimg0,Abusive brother wont leave me the hell alone,"Its hard to talk about it but my brother is constantly slandering both me and my elderly parents online. He is saying triggering shit like I am a murderer. He is saying my parents are in on it. He is creating fake facebook accounts and constantly posting pictures of me trying have me arrested. Each of these posts become more and more unhinged. But its not the fact that hes slandering thats bothering me. He is also accusing me of SA of a minor and thats something that happened to me. I was the victim of that. Its Something that messed me up in middle school and took a long time to recover from. Something that, in my mind, had stole my ability to feel like a human being. He didnt do that to me but he reinforced that and he has sent my mind into spiral thats being going on for 5 years. Its like two life ruining events, joining forces to break me in all ways humanly possible. 
He also said that he wants to kill me. He has said it multiple times but wouldnt dare say it online. But I feel like he is serious and will do it. He is on either morphine, heroin, Fent, or meth. His obsession with me is getting worse and we know he is schizophrenic and this is probably some sort of drug related psychosis. Im not a doctor so idk what the hell you would call this.

So yeah... if this is it, if he succeeds in killing me, when you look my name up in google, his bullshit is the first thing you see. I know reddit isnt the place to say this, but I wanted to say the truth because I cannot stand up to this bastard. I cannot make this stop. My parents are afraid of him and they dont know what to do. The police dont give a shit and it takes them forever getting to my house... So this might be it. He is armed and thats what scares me the most.",1755218473.0,6,2,ptsd,ptsd
1mqne5d,Flashbacks,"Tw: talks about overdose

Hello, 
I am currently in therapy and I realize the event I went through was super traumatic. I’m just looking for support and advice from people who have gone through similar experiences. 

A few months ago I came home from work and found my partner basically dead. He was barely breathing, no heartbeat and had accidentally overdosed. I had to perform chest compressions and call 911 and thankfully he is still with us. 

I guess the reason for my post is that I am still super traumatized. At least once a week, sometimes daily, I flash back to this event and the thought of it makes me feel physically sick. I am doing therapy weekly but I don’t feel like the therapy is helping with this specific issue, even when I do talk about it. Will I ever stop having these vivid flashbacks? Should I be doing some sort of specialized trauma therapy? Has anyone been through something similar? If so, what worked for you to cope with it? I’m not sure if there’s a better sub to post this in. Thank you for any advice. ",1755231901.0,2,2,ptsd,ptsd

as ive been bumping my head and learning how to read and talk to people ive noticed that you can tell how someone feels about you by the way they look at you. i look into my friends eyes and i see love. i see how much they care about me. when i look into a certain someones eyes i can tell she wants to f*ck me. when i used to look into my parents eyes i saw hatred. i saw disgust. it hurt me so deeply the way my parents looked at me. and ive always wondered why. 

why do you hate me so much? what did i do to deserve it? i know why now. they hate themselves. they see themselves in me and they hate themselves so much that they put it onto me. all the time ive spent wondering why they treated me so badly. how could you treat your own child like that? because they dont see me as their child. they dont see me as my own person. they only see me as an extension of themselves. i understand now.

its an extremely bittersweet feeling. on one hand, im deeply saddened to know that my parents will never be the parents i needed. they will never be the parents i need currently. they will never be able to love me because they hate themselves that much. on the other hand, i am no longer wondering why. i have closure now. 

im about to block my moms number and i dont feel guilty in the slightest. the last time she contacted me (after months of me not even acknowledging her existence) she texted me about the car accident i was in. all she talked about was the insurance claim and the lawyers. didnt ask me how i was doing or anything. just goes to show the type of person she truly is.

i finally feel free to truly live my life and be myself without the words and actions of my abusers replaying in my head at every moment. im happy. i can genuinely say im happy now. thank you for reading 😇😇😇🩷🩷🩷",1755210948.0,4,2,ptsd,ptsd

1mprjku,Extreme guilt over videos my abuser showed me,"TW- Graphic,CSA,CP,Suicide

Im now 18. But when I was 8 I was raped for the first time. It went on for like a year. My rapist also showed me how to masturbate. Showed me porn. Taught me about different kinks and ways to have sex. Basically just ruined my innocence any single way possible.

Some of the porn specifically gives me awful guilt. Some of the porn was of children. I guess to show me it was something kids around my age do. 

At the time i didnt understand the whole situation. I was very innocent. So I didn’t understand until I was a bit older how fucked up that was but the more time goes on the worse I feel. 

I remember not liking being raped and wanting it to stop but being helpless because I could basically suck it up and try to enjoy it/act like I was enjoying it or I could resist and get beaten or screamed at. But when I wouldn’t resist I was treated nicely and would sometimes even somewhat enjoy it.

But it still stressed me out so much every day we were together it would happen. Sometimes multiple times a day. I would have to sneak to the bathroom because if I was spotted I was followed and raped in the toilet.

One day we had already had sex that day so my rapist asked if I want to “play our game again” or watch videos I said the videos. And my rapist said to touch myself when I liked what I saw. So I did. Some of which was child porn. 

I don’t think I actually liked it sexually I just likes it more because it was relatable at the time. Made me feel a bit less alone. Also some of the videos I was shown was like graphic kink videos which scared me. But I masturbated because that’s what my rapist liked seeing I think to know what I was in to or something and if I didn’t at all my rapist would be aggressive. 

Now I can’t get over the extreme guilt. I feel like a criminal even though I was just a kid myself and didnt understand. I don’t want to live with this guilt. I’ve attempted suicide over this. I still want to die. Im almost obsessively scared of becoming a peadophile even though I know I’m not in any way like that Im scared that just by seeing that even at that age means Im destined to become a rapist. Even though I know rationally I would never and dont want to and hate people like that.

It keeps me up at night. I feel like I deserve to die because of the guilt. I can’t tell anyone this not even my therapist because I’m that scared and feel that awful.

1mqd3h7,Is this the cause of my CPTSD?,"For years now ive had the “feeling” that i was SAd as a child, specifically by my dad. This comes from suddenly thinking about some weird memories that i always had:

I remember a game that i always felt We used to play that consisted of him lying on top of me while in bed and i remember laughing but also it being painful and me getting out of breath from his weight and getting scared. I also king of remember him being Very serious during all of this and me being confused by his serious expression and demeanor. I Also brought it up to my older brother like: do you remember when dad laid on top of us to get us out of breath? And he looked at me like wtf.

I also have difusse memories of him siting on my bed in the middle of the night and i remember years later thinking that they were sleep parálysis allucinations.

I also have had forever the memory of me walking into the bathroom as a toddler, him peeing in the toilet and inviting me in with a smile and showing me his p***s.

Also i remember being Very sexual when being Very little, specially because it was weird fantasies, kind of violent ones: i remember thinking of a women (in my mind, it was me) hanging upside down, naked, tied to a pole by the ankles and hanging over the sea, wich had sharks, and the town watching this punishment. And i know i thought about that as a sexual thing. But i couldnt be older than 6 or 7 by then, and i think i was younger even.

My dad has never been inapropiate to me or anyone, but ive been assaulted with flashes of us having sex and stuff like that for years now, not as a memory thing, more like a compulsive and repoulsive unwanted imagination.

Please keep in mind that this memories feel Very unreal and distant, even though i think i have had them forever but i didnt think about them till years ago. (Im now 30)

Also, ive always struggled with my mental health, i have had depressions and anxiety for no reason, nonstop, since i was like 17. I dont have any history of trauma or abuse, ive never brought this up on therapy because i always thought it couldnt be possible and i feel guilty for giving it any consideration.

I didn't deserve it... they were adults, I was a child. I'm not at fault in any way, but still I feel like I am...

It makes no logical sense... trying to answer those questions myself is ruining me mentally... it makes me scream into my hands out of frustration, out of existential dread...

1mqkh4k,Anyone else suffering from nightmares they don't even remember?,"TW: CSA, rape, physical abuse

It's been over a year since I've used this reddit account as I've tried to avoid thinking about trauma as much as possible. Reading other people's stories and struggles can be validating and reassuring that it's not just me, but I'm coming back because today I need advice. 

Most of my PTSD comes from childhood sexual abuse. I have daily struggles with flashbacks, triggers, etc. I go to therapy weekly, I take my meds, I've tried multiple modalities to improve and things just don't seem to get better. 

Recently they have gotten worse. I am waking up, not remembering anything about my dreams, and immediately having a panic attack or crying. I'm waking up in the middle of the night and a few times over the course of the morning. Waking up, freaking out, forcing myself to go back to sleep because I'm miserable, waking up to another panic attack an hour or so later and repeating this process nearly every day. I end up sleeping most days until noon. 

I have no idea most of the time what I'm dreaming because I don't remember the dreams at all but they are causing these reactions. 

My psychiatrist has offered me a medicine in the past that is supposed to help with nightmares but I'm scared of taking medications but at this point I'm desperate for a fix, so I'm going to ask about getting in with them sooner than my next appointment and hopefully talk about whatever medicine that is.

now, ever since i was maybe 9, which was when my earliest major trauma happened, ive felt like my bedroom has been metaphorically haunted by the traumas ive gone through. i feel tense spending time in my room, ive had months on end where ive slept in other rooms to mitigate this, but ultimately i cant sleep on the couch forever and i do like my room aside from the fact that it feels so shitty

i cant just switch to a different room, i dont have the space nor time for that, but i genuinely dont know what to do about the fact that my room feels like it's got all of my trauma stored in it. if not for the fact that my room feels awful to be in i really do like my bedroom, its got a nice view from the window, it has a good closet, its got everything i need. thats why i want to be able to like it again

1mpzlvi,Divorce after 20 years. I don’t know how to keep going.,"My wife and I divorced in March after 20 years of what I thought was a happy marriage. We have two boys, 10 and 16. My oldest is special needs—autism, Tourette’s, bipolar, ADHD—and became extremely violent toward me during COVID as puberty hit. For 3–4 years, I endured broken windows, stabbing, attacks while driving, threats to kill me, being chased with sharp objects, punched, bitten, and clawed. Police were called dozens of times, and he’s been in multiple facilities, one for over 500 days. As his violence escalated, our marriage fell apart. My wife distanced herself and I had no family nearby.

I coped by heavy cannabis and psychedelic use, which began as relief but spiraled into extreme dissociation. I was also diagnosed ADHD and bipolar and PTSD. In my delusion and pain, I made the irreversible mistake of cheating on my wife—something I’ll never forgive myself for. I’m devastated, consumed by regret, and plagued daily by suicidal thoughts. I even attempted once but couldn’t go through with it. I spent time in a mental institution, started new meds, and racked up a large bill.

I’ve been sober since March, fully aware of the pain I’ve caused. I’m losing the home we’ve had for 6 years—it’s been on the market for months without selling despite price drops. I moved to a new place when I had money, but now can’t afford rent while still paying the mortgage. The divorce left me so distraught I lost both jobs in May. I’ve repented, turned back to God, and cling to scripture, but the pain never leaves. I feel disgusted with myself and struggle to find motivation. I try to be a good dad, but the darkness always pulls me back.

She’s moved on with a new boyfriend. I love my boys deeply and know my death would devastate them, yet I often feel I can’t go on. Friends nearby don’t know how to help, and I’m mostly alone. Therapy hasn’t helped much. I’m haunted by vivid dreams of her, only to wake to this nightmare. I can’t believe what I’ve done to my family, and the pain never leaves.

I thought i saw him the other day and my heart starting racing, my breathing picked up. Same old responses as always. I thought that assurance from him would put an end to all of that. I dont know, i guess i just thought that an apology would cure me. I thought it would be the magical kiss to awaken me from my slumber. Realizing that I was wrong is devastating, because it means I have a lot more work to do. I cant tell if I am experiencing closure, or if closure never comes. The incident does feel... over now. In a purely logical way. It doesnt feel over in my emotions, in my mind, in my body. Logic tells me it's over and i can stop running and hiding. i dont have to be so scared, because now i have definitive proof that i am safe. But still, i dont feel that way. Plus, i knew logically that i was safe before the apology (maybe. I knew it, but there wasnt a lick of certainty) Is closure just a myth, an illusion? Or is it here? I do not know.

1mq8wd9,Need a psych POV on a weird situation . Consultant/SAS insight especially welcome.,"
This is a throw away account.
I am also not holding or pursuing a career in medicine so I understand it if you’d prefer to leave this unanswered. 

Hey all, bit of a strange one and I’d really appreciate some outside perspective ideally from someone working in psych (consultant level would be amazing if you’re lurking).

Back in April I was briefly on a friendship/dating app. No identifiable photo, wide search radius (2+ hrs from home), just testing the waters - 1st time on something like this. Chatted with someone who also had no photo, said he was looking for friendship. We exchanged numbers as I was deactivating the account (online apps are not for me - do NOT recommend 😂) and kept chatting via text until July. Roughly 14 weeks of communication. Nothing flirty or dodgy , just general life stuff, hobbies, values, etc. Enjoyable conversation, had a few laughs…it was refreshing. 

Eventually he asked for a photo, I said sure but asked for one from him first. He sent it and unfortunately ,as it turns out,  he’s one of my psychiatrists 😳 🤦‍♀️ 

I didn’t send my photo back and told him it’s not appropriate to keep talking and explained why. I deleted his number as I didn’t want to land him in any trouble. I’m aware of all the ethics surrounding Dr/Patient conduct- mainly from my time working as a nurse. NMC guidelines which I imagine are similar to the GMC guidelines. 

I get a text and without going into much detail I get an apology for the circumstances with some options. 

1. I request a new psychiatrist and we stop talking- he can refer me on.

2. He checks whether it’s appropriate to continue as my psychiatrist, and if so, we stop personal contact but continue with the treatment plan if I feel comfortable with that. 

**I imagine my care will be supervised if this is approved.**???

3. He seeks advice from work and if it can be deemed appropriate given the circumstances, I could switch treatment to another doctor and we could continue with our friendship. 

For reference. 
I’m seeing him for trauma-related sleep issues/nightmares, so this isn’t a great situation and I imagine I would be labelled as ‘vulnerable’ looking at guidelines. 

I really like him on a friendship level and we have got on famously so far. I think the feeling is mutual so it’s a rather unfortunate situation. My priority is that I absolutely don’t land him into any trouble with his job. Despite needing psychiatric help , I think I’m quite level headed and I certainly have morals! That being said,  I’ll be gutted cutting contact but I will if I need to. 

What I’m not keen on is changing Dr. He has treated me for a lengthy period of time and I have had a positive experience with him as my Dr with improved mental health. I’m not better , I don’t think I’ll ever fully get over what has happened to me that has led me to psychiatric care however I have come a very very long way under his care. 

I’ve tried looking into GMC stuff and option 3 seems risky for him professionally albeit this is a situation that has come about completely by accident. I wouldn’t say he has acted in any way shape or form unprofessionally.


So I guess my question is - As a senior Dr… what would your advice be? Where does he stand ? Where do I stand ? What would your advice be to someone working under you? 

Im expecting option 3 to be a no go (tragic glint on my eye)

I’m hoping option 2 is possible. 

I’ll be quietly disappointed of option 1 turns out to be the only option. 🫠🙈🤦‍♀️

1mqd227,Your thoughts?,"
I sought peace by volunteering at a senior citizen center, hoping to stop isolating myself. Initially, I felt optimistic about my time there, but after confiding in my supervisor about a sensitive issue, she betrayed my trust by reporting it to the Director. This led to accusations against me, resulting in my termination. Despite my hard work over three months, I now fear for my reputation.

I want to move on but feel stuck. I'm considering addressing the situation by investigating the center's financials, as it is a nonprofit funded by various sources. It's frustrating because I respected both women involved, and their actions have disrupted my life.

1mpi5ax,"Accidentally caught in the aftermath of a protest and was injured, unable to face veteran boyfriend since that night","My boyfriend and I were walking back to his car a couple nights ago downtown. There were a million police cars blocking the streets so we knew something was going on but not what. We turned up a busy street and a group of panicked people came running past us, some of them crying. There was teargas or pepper spray in the air so my eyes were streaming. My boyfriend who was next to me grabbed me by the shoulders to pull me infront of him to shield me from whatever was coming but he just ended up throwing me hard onto the asphalt infront of him because we both couldn't really see. I was bleeding from my knees, my elbow, and the collar of my shirt left a bruise across the front of my throat from when he yanked me back after I fell. He picked me up in two seconds and carried me but my elbow left a lot of blood all over the front of his shirt.

My boyfriend has a bunch of combat trauma and was discharged after he was burned turning a protest in his country. We literally wandered into his worst nightmare and I know he just panicked and tried to protect me. Apparently it was some sort of illegal protest a block up and we just got caught it the aftermath of the police breaking it up. I felt so awful my bf broke down in the car apologizing for hurting me, that he thought someone was going to throw a bomb. 

I was diagnosed and treated for ptsd as a kid from a violent crime and I survived a tbi a couple years ago. I don't know why but since this happened I don't want anything to do with my bf. I refused to go to his house after it happened and haven't seen him since. I feel so ashamed of these stupid injuries all over me and I don't know why. I don't want him to see me. I came home and just wanted to hurt myself and not talk to anyone. He told his family, I didn't tell anyone. I'm not answering anyone's messages. I feel all this shame over what happened and I don't know why. My bf sent me flowers to apologize. He knows I have ptsd but not from what and I don't want to tell him. I know I am being very unfair to him. He just wants to see me. He asked if I hated him and it made me feel so awful, of course I don't. I just feel so depressed and so much self loathing.

As soon as it was over I ended up in clinic two nights back to back, feeling too limp to even walk. 

And that whole thing changed me, I can’t spend the day without the fear of the war starting again, Anything related to it gives me a panic attack, doors closing too loudly or anything that represents a loud bang freaks me out to the point of tears and I feel overly depressed all the time. It’s like I lost a piece of me during that time and I can’t pull myself out of it, I’m too tired of feeling this way, constantly crying. I just feel terrible, I don’t know how to feel at peace.

He can be away, on the road, he can be ill, he can be at work it doesnt matter. Who is responsible of well being of his close people when the head isnt capable of for a moment.

And i failed of being in charge of taking care of well being of the family when needed. He was strong as a bear. Nothing ever was a problem for him. Never needed help and back then, when he need help from his right hand, i doesnt help. I become the head of his house where i live till now and i was lazy, unprepared  to help when needed.

1mptavh,Did I scare him off after showing too much emotion?,"I (26F) worked with a guy (21M) for a month on a short-term job. He has a rough past — alcoholic/abusive dad, parents divorced when he was 8-9 after dad cheated, was bullied/beaten at school, attempted suicide, and is now in therapy. He comes across as fine but obviously carries some emotional scars and has PTSD.

At first, I thought he was flirting with me because of how he acted, but he denied it — said I’m not his type, “guarantees” he’s not attracted to me. We became friends after I told him people were talking behind his back. Over the next few weeks we got closer: on group outings we’d stick together all evening, share personal things, and he started texting me daily (sometimes multiple times a day, even prioritizing it over sleep, checking on my safety getting home after work).

Last week he asked me out 1-on-1, even though he prefers groups. He offered to cook the main dish if I made dessert for a picnic. He went out of his way to accommodate my many dietary restrictions. We talked for 3.5 hours straight — time flew.

During the picnic, he shared three of his own poems about his abuse, loneliness, and feeling lost in life. They were deep and heavy, and I ended up crying. He asked if I wanted a hug, I said yes, and he comforted me, saying “It’s okay, I’m alright, see?” He said my reaction shocked him. Then he added “don’t do it again” and I said hat crying makes me feel better.

After that, we went back to normal — laughing, joking, and he gave me compliments that felt not-so-platonic. He knows I’m leaving at the end of the month (to study abroad, but I’ll be back to visit in December for 3 weeks and summer, as my parents live in his city). He said “we need to go out at least once before you leave,” and I said I’d like to go out multiple times, he said:""That as well"".

When I got home (he texted before I even arrived to check), I thanked him for everything and said I feel very happy every time I see him. He said he feels the same and that we understand each other better now. I told him I didn’t expect to get so emotional but I really felt there with him, and I don’t handle it as well as he does. He said it’s nothing to be ashamed of. I ended the conversation early because I was drained, saying we’d talk tomorrow.

It’s now been 2 days — no text from him, even though before the picnic we were in constant daily contact.

Did I overwhelm him? Is he taking space because of the intensity? Or did something about that day change how he feels about me?",1755154674.0,2,2,ptsd,ptsd

1mp8zan,My nan says my boyfriend will leave if I don’t start sleeping with him,"Hi everyone,
I could use some perspective because my head is spinning. I have BPD and PTSD from past trauma. When I have PTSD flare-ups, sexual activity can make me feel sick, panicked, and unsafe. Because of the BPD, my emotions can also swing harder, and any fear of abandonment feels huge.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years. He knows about my mental health, and he’s been patient and supportive. He’s told me clearly that he won’t leave me just because we’re not having regular sex right now.

But recently my nan told me that if I don’t sleep with him regularly, “he’ll eventually leave.” I know older generations sometimes have different ideas about relationships, but her words really got into my head. My anxiety has been through the roof, and it’s making my PTSD episodes worse because I keep imagining losing him.

Has anyone else had a family member make comments like this? How do you deal with outside opinions that feed your worst fears? I’m in therapy, but it’s still hard to shake this.

Lately I’ve been having bad nightmares that wake me up in the middle of the night. Tonight, I had a stress dream that bolted me awake at 4 am. Eddy was sitting patiently behind me, and I started petting her when I noticed she was there. 
I was laying on my side, and she draped her body over me and started purring super hard. Didn’t leave until I came out of the nightmare haze and felt a little more stable. 

It occurred to me that she only does this particular behavior if I’m having a panic attack in the middle of the night or if I am otherwise awake and scared at this hour. And it’s super effective - the weight of her body pressing on me is calming, and I’m more focused on petting her than I am on spiraling. 

She’s also extremely cuddle driven, so no doubt she gets something out of this too lol.

1mpsqej,Do i have PTSD?,"I’m still in this relationship, but I feel like I’m losing myself.

I got constantly abused for months! Still my partner twists my words, blames me for things I didn’t do, and makes me feel like everything wrong is my fault. If he drinks too much, cheats, or lashes out, somehow I’m the one who ends up apologizing. Whenever I try to set boundaries, I’m told I’m “crazy” or “overreacting.” His mom said Im the reason he has turned this was. Apparently he was a saint before! (He was in prison for 11 years btw) 

He’s kicked me out multiple times, and even when I had nowhere to go, it was somehow my fault for “leaving.” His behavior has encouraged his parents to treat me horribly, and they have. Once, I was completely breaking down crying, shaking, and even throwing up from stress and instead of supporting me, he sat with his mom to talk badly about me. I was sitting on a chair completely breaking down while he and his mom was sleeping & giggling on the bed laughing at me (he was tickling him and playing with her seeing how shattered i am) . The next day, his mom pulled me aside to “teach me another lesson.”

This keeps happening. They’re always involved in our relationship, and it’s making me feel unsafe in my own home. I’m constantly anxious, replaying situations in my head, and I don’t feel like the person I used to be. It got worse when his dad called me and said “i should get 🍇 one day.” It still gives me nightmares!!!! How a 50 year older than me man can say that to me (he calls me his daughter, my foot!) 

Can you even get PTSD while still living in the situation that’s causing it? Has anyone been through this and found a way out?

1mpg2hd,OCD ptsd,"For 14 years I spent everyday replying details of my childhood to make sense of it. Eventually I realized I couldn’t let go of my ptsd with my dad because I had a dream when I was a kid, and I tried to go to my therapist ( I knew going to my mom she wouldn’t have understood it was a dream) because my therapist was the one who explains what the nightmares from PTSD were and what “Daymares” are. So she’d understand. No, she didn’t understand and I lost my dad’s side of the family and had little to a lot of times no contact. The only thing that I ever almost got grounded for til I was 18 was reaching out to my dad. Any time I tried to speak up to my mom that it was a dream “but you told your therapist” girl you weren’t there shush. Anywho. But now that I finally figured it out ( I got married and the father daughter dance planing really helped me figure out what I was missing) my brains like okay what next 
And it’s just going through my whole life of things I never saw clearly mostly because I never wanted to see the negative. 
But there’s so much! So much! I have FND Which is a neurological disorder that’s easily explained by the brain fires mis signals to my nerve system and it’s basically like a spotty phone call, you’ll hear and understand parts of it but not enough to get the whole picture to know what to do. A lot of things steam from it, but for me it developed around developmental neglect and childhood trauma. A lot of people around me don’t understand ptsd and they feel like it’s just anxiety but it’s being trapped in that moment even when you know you aren’t there, your body doesn’t. And the shut downs and miscommunications. Know you need to tell someone but if they don’t understand it makes it worse. Which isn’t their fault but, it makes finding a support group a bit harder. My support group does a lot but with there limited understanding it really affects me differently. Especially with the neglect I went through. I basically was a stay at home kid who never was taught to understand life or experience it so highschool came I got a job and lot of stuff changes. For the better! But there’s so much that goes into dealing with this everyday it’s hard to even stay on track😩 
But I do gotta say every day I make progress. I have vivid dreams and they usually come from past experiences and as long as I can identify the experience I usually can work through the dream and then it moves to the next event. 

It’s really hard to actually put all this on someone who isn’t doing it as a career. I know friends care but with a narcissist mother every time I got support that went against what she thought or believed she had to argue until I agreed , or so that last part felt I didn’t usually actually agree but over time my brain could only remember what she said rather than what happened and it’s, hhhhhhhhh:(

I have no friends. No family who like me. I’m all alone. Even some of my teachers hated me in primary school. I remember being so kind and sweet as a kid. But I don’t think thats the case anymore. I must’ve done something wrong. I don’t understand why else every possible bad thing that could ever happen to me happens to me.

1mouy6q,"Almost died from a GI bleed, finally putting it on paper","so it happened 2x. First time i was in boston, went out with my sister and ate something spicy. got woken up by my mom to see some hotel bookings, went to the toilet to poop, no pain, felt like diarrhea. not unusual given i ate something spicy. I look down, just blood, i go again 2 mins later just blood, and another time. just blood. I call my mom, she thinks im over reacting, i see everything spin and almost faint, i manage to compose myself. I call my dad, he asks me if its a tiny cut, i tell him no, its a massive bleed. I call my mom, she picks up but thinks im over reacting. Takes me to the hospital. I get there, no bleed for a while. We get into the er and they take my bloods, everything seems ok, except a slight temperature raise and high serum lactate. My mom leaves to go to the mall (thinks im over reacting). not long after, i start losing buckets of blood, like the ones used for vomiting, i maybe fill half of a few of those up. the blood looks dark red like a cherry. I go in for a ct scan and nothing. They replace my fluids, keep me overnight, by then the bleeding was slowing down. and by the next day i had no bleeding. hemoglobin had decreased from 15 to 9, and then stabilised. I go home, to portugal, see some gi specialists, get a colonoscopy and nothing, by now they think it was a bursted hemmorhoid or an acute gi infection... who knows. I live my life normally, do everything ok. 3 months later I was living in London for my masters, was doing well and finally living my life. for a few weeks i had been having weird symptoms, clear acidic mucus from feces, and a few times my feces looked green or slightly weirder tone than normal and consistency too (not black, but definetely darker and slimier). one night I was gaming with my friend, and i felt my intestines rumble. I go to the toilet, and i see a huge blood clot on the toilet... fuck. I call an ambulance but theyre 2 hours out. at this point im losing blood. not as much as boston, but definetely small quantities continously coming. i go to the nhs and wait a lot, a lot a lot. unlike last time, im getting black blood now, the rate is nowhere near as fast as boston. I end up waiting 8 hours to be seen, they run some blood tests, i tell them my history (that its happened 1x before), they send me home while still bleeding, they tell me to come back next later in the afternoon to maybe do some exams. I wake up with a sweat, go to the bathroom and lose more blood (moderate volume), I later learnt my bed sheets were covered in blood. I get to the hospital and they put me in a random ass ward where all i do is wait, they take my bloods and monitor my blood pressure. no other exams.... 5pm comes along, im still moderately bleeding but still nothing like boston, the doctor comes and tells me medically speaking im ok, bloods are fine and i can go home. I have an inner feeling and a voice that tells me not to, as if it knew deep down something bad would happen. I tell the dr, its the second time I bleed, 90 days apart exactly, no cause, and you want me to go home. I wont. He told me ok, we can see if we can keep you for 1 day to monitor you, we will see. maybe 5-20 minutes after he left, i was still in the ward, i start really bleeding, i mean a lot more than boston. were talking the blood volume lost from boston which took a few hours in maybe 20 minutes, and it didnt stop. maybe 5-12 episodes of massive bleeding. i would fill those 300ml buckets up (of course i know blood irritates the gi tract so a large percentage was water too), but it looked like a crime scene. I started calling for help, no one cared, I walked to the main er area, dizzy, went to the bathroom and had another huge bleed, which to make it dramatic i threw it all over the bathroom (doctors thought my blood loss volume was low like before, so i had to show them). a doctor saw me and immediately took me to a bed, other doctors were coming and going, i kept bleeding, at this point i thought i was going to die, i went from 14.7 hemoglobin to 7.4. Both my parents were outside the country, I call them, and it was the hardest phone call I ever made, telling my mom and dad i love them and that it might be the last time i see them. I was getting really dizzy, nurses were fighting as they wanted to leave (as i was losing so much blood), doctors were visibly shaking, and repeating the same thing over and over (""youre ok, youre in a safe place, were doing our best"") while he visibly was shaking. all i could ask was, am i going to die? I got on the phone with my mom, sister and dad and told them i love you guys, this might be it. and i just felt sad i couldnt see them again. Idk the exact time line after, (blood loss makes focusing hard), I was put in a ward, where other serious patients were, idk if it was the icu or not. I was given 2 blood transfusions that night. next few days were a constant battle, constant exams, repeat colonoscopies, endoscopies, ct scans, ct angiograms, abdominal angiogram. I mean i was a guinea pig. And then every day maybe 1 or 2x I would have severe blood loss episodes. Were talking, maybe losing massive ammounts of blood in 20-30 mins. I was even get 2 blood transfusions at the same time. After maybe 4-5 days, the chief surgeon was considering an exploratory laparotomy, I was bleeding so much and unpredictably that the head doctors thought I am at risk of death and we need to fix it... They take me to the surgery ward at 9pm, the theatre is full, they decide to do one last colonoscopy and endoscopy to check if the bleeding has stopped, luckily it did. I was moved to a milder ward, and at this point i didnt lose as much blood as before, it was all black and it was honestly minimal compared to the fountains before. I had a capsule endoscopy which was useless as everything in my small intestine had blood, i did some prep to try and clear the intestines but it didnt work. at this point, i had been in hospital for 8-9 days. they send me to do a meckel scan at a specialised hospital as they didnt have one there. It came back positive. I had a laparotomy surgery, and they removed 8cm of small bowel that was all corroded by the stomach acid, as well as my appendix. Those next few days were hell, the pain was bad, morphine just made me high but didnt ease my pain. And I could barely walk without crying, first time i tried to walk, i vomited and almost passed out. I forgot to mention, due to my bleeds, they were giving me some medication, i dont remember the name to stop bleeds maybe (transamic acid), it made me vomit every time i took it. After the surgery i had a wound infection due to poor wound cleaning from the nursed, and had to had debreament due to partial dishedence, also had an uti... I honestly think it was the hardest thing I ever faced. I was in hospital for 2 weeks, lost 8kg as I wasnt allowed to eat. at one point my glucose was ultra low. it was a shit show... im just glad to be alive. but i know this experience messed me up, probably ptsd, my ocd got worse, health anxiety got worse. for 8 months i was on fight or flight, on edge, crying thinking some other rare disease would kill me, i even broke up with my gf and dropped out of my course as i thought i was going to die. I would get panic attacks if i left my house. Id get night sweats, feeling really cold, looked pale.

After having stuff happened that made me pissed due to the fact that I didn't get upset (I froze and over time I started whimpering and they ended up taking me home so no sex but I hated that I had no idea they had any weird intentions and blamed myself for a long time ) I was left with a weird irritation with men who seemed stronger than me physically. And honestly that can happen easily since I'm not a tough girl or anything. But holy crap do they piss me off sometimes. If a guy ""acts tough"" my brain doesn't think they look cool or anything my brain thinks they're trying to show they are a potential threat and that they may look down on me. I end up thinking they are competing with me. I grit my teeth and smile to be polite and look at their muscles and wonder how often they workout in order to want to like challenge them it's so freaking weird. I was never super into working out and still struggle to be but now I have this weird fear of them seeing my lack of muscles and laughing at me or thinking they could fight me easily. I am glad it stopped going to more extremes but holy crap. They just naturally look stronger sometimes and it's not a big deal. I admire physically strong women and feel safer around them but men? They make me think I need to be on guard to fight and it doesn't help that I have a shy personality and girly interests. It makes me feel like I have to hide myself and I switch up my tone so much to try and sound more secure and not afraid since I am terrified of something happening and them blaming my shyness or something and making me out to be the one who was trying to gain attention.

1moawo9,Traumatized from Involuntary Hospital Stays,"How have people dealt with trauma from involuntary hospital stays?

I had a very bad reaction to hormonal birth control and overnight I went from peak mental health to totally crazy. It led to a number of traumatizing hospital stays.

I had an initial hospital stay that didn't really bother me and was given psych meds.

Not too much later, I was at my parent's house and I was hearing things again and it scared me. I knew I needed help. I didn't want to have to stay in the hospital though. The voice in my head that was trying to scare me told me that people would force me into the hospital. I decided to be brave and trust those around me. I said I needed help and wanted to get different medicine as this one wasn't helping. I made my mother promise me over and over that I wouldn't be forced into the hospital. Of course, that's exactly what happened. I remember they put on the paperwork why they were holding me was because I had said (to my mother earlier) I was going to fly back to my university.

A lot of my stays were similar stories. They would say because I wasn't working (I was in college) that I was gravely disabled when I would question the validity of my stays. The stays disrupted my classes too, so I had to take time off...and that was used to hold me. I found it extremely traumatizing to be held against my will, especially since they were holding me when I wasn't a danger to myself or others. I could understand holding me then if that was the case. Saying I'm a danger to myself because I'm some sort of flight risk due to telling my mother before I asked for help that I was going to fly back to my university is ridiculous. Or that because I'm trying new medicine, it makes me a danger to myself or others as they don't know how I will respond is really twisting things. My words were constantly twisted to keep me in the hospital like this too. When you're in distress, this is the last thing one needs. Having my trust broken when I asked for help made me very alone and not want to seek help in the future. It also validated what the voice said.

One time, I was forced to strip naked. They threatened me that they would force me and with a longer stay if I didn't comply. They also were trying to get me to sign papers saying I would donate my organs and some other paper like a power of attorney when I was being held. Really scary!

While the medicines are technically voluntary, they wouldn't let you out if you didn't comply, so they aren't really voluntary.  I wanted medicine that worked, but a lot of the medicines had horrible side effects and didn't seem to help me either. In the end, I just went along with it and suffered so I could get out. A lot of times I was there ""volunarily"" but they said if I didn't elect to be voluntary they would put me on an involuntary hold.

Of course, they let the guy out trying to start a cult that challenged his stay through the court. I felt too hopeless to try the court though.

Based off of what was happening, I was terrified of being institutionalized or ""voluntarily"" getting ECT or something. A lot of things that are supposedly voluntary involve a lot of coercion in these hospitals, in my experience. I felt extremely helpless and disempowered...and without allies to help me get better. This was really traumatic for me.

The last therapist I saw told me it's not possible to be traumatized from hospital stays and that he ran one. I wish I could get help, but I'm deeply traumatized and can't put myself through more trauma from the supposed mental health industry. Ive worked really hard to overcome the helplessness and lack of agency, but I still struggle. I feel terrible everyday. Any advise for how to deal with this? These series of short hospital stays happened 15 years ago. It haunts me everyday. I don't know how the mental health industry can screw up this badly. I think I have PTSD from the hospital stays. I just wanted help.",1755010419.0,48,44,ptsd,ptsd
1monijc,How do I cope while living with my assailant?,"I (m17) can't stand living at home anymore. Growing up my childhood was filled with abuse and neglect and all the fun things, but 2 years ago my mom sexually assaulted me. I don't wanna share details, but it went far enough to get her charged with SA. Cps got involved a bit after (not sure who called) and I had this whole case against her (closed now), and when they asked me if I wanted to press charges for the SA I couldn't get myself to say yes I don't know why. Idk I felt like I couldn't be the one to send her away, I wish they just took it into their own hands, I couldn't take her away from my siblings they are too young to understand. It's so hard seeing and waking up to my abusers face every day and I regret not pressing charges so fucking much. It's my biggest regret in life so far. It's so hard to have to listen to her every command or face repercussions, I'm just a slave to them they get away with everything. My dad even told me he's just waiting for all of this to blow over and go back to normal... I'm nearly 18 and have heard that you can move out before 18 under the right conditions such as abuse and neglect. Could anyone help me out? I'm not sure what I even wanna hear, any kind words are appreciated. I just got into some shit with the both of my parents (dads aware just doesn't care) and I really need to leave. I have options and people waiting to take me in once I'm 18, but I'm really struggling with every passing day to make it to that goal. I just want to leave one way or another.

EDIT: it happened 2 years ago, not last year. My apologies. Also forgot to mention that the SA stopped after the 4th-5th time, so I think I'm safe for now. It's been a while.",1755038733.0,11,31,ptsd,ptsd
1mow07w,Is it reasonable to expect a person with a PTSD dx to come around to the new partner?,"I've been going through the grief subreddits about what to do. I've come to realize that the only opinions I should probably care about are that of a professional and other sufferers.

Straight to the point: PTSD dx, hypothyroidism, also fibromyalgia/RLS/BFS/chronic deja vu and myoclonus that has been exacerbated by all of this as well (I was seen by a neurologist for this for a bit). I had to go back to therapy once a week. Cause was a LOT of child abuse, csa, abused in every possible way but what finally led to the full blown symptoms was Munchausen by Proxy by one parent and the stepparent that led to eventual thyroid and other minor damage because of the unnecesary shit they were making me take, getting screamed at for days on end and finally discarded after 27 years of knowing this parent like.... I was nothing.

There's a lot I'm leaving out and I don't want to talk about it at all. I'm doing my best just to stick to the facts here. The main point and background info: I was not only abused by my parents but by both sets of stepparents as well.

I almost lost my life in a few cases due to one of parents being particularly vicious and sadistic (the worst memories are them smiling at my pain and distress) and had a classic NDE/OBE experience from all of the dissociation/depersonalization symptoms.

I went no contact 110% full estrangement even with the decent human beings in my family. It was hard, but I couldn't be around them either. I move halfway across the world to be with my now husband. Things went well. His parents were a godsend, they didn't have to be so caring and equally invested in me as if I were their own, but they were. They were truly the parents I never had. My MIL really and truly loved me like her own. She didn't have to but she did.

Skip to December 2023 my dear precious lovely MIL is diagnosed with cancer. She died in February 2024. It was not a slow tragic demise, it was quick and sudden for everyone.

I ...think I handled the grief okay. I didn't really have panic attacks and and any resurfacing PTSD symptoms from it, just.....healthy grief I guess? I was mostly sad and just playing Minecraft while allowing myself just to feel my own feelings without shame or guilt. I came to a point last August where I felt....like I could move forward with my life by doing things like going back to college. Things that would make her proud.

That same month FIL tells us in a... very blindsiding way that he has a new partner. He wants to introduce us to her. I'm.....actually pretty supportive of him. I want him to be happy and moving forward with a new partner in general isn't the real issue. As close as I was to MIL he had been nothing but good to me and was trying to do the whole ""big happy family"" thing...I guess. I did my best to support him...

In private the intrusive thoughts came, the lack of trust in the process, the fear of losing him if I didn't get with it or get over my fears, being absolutely terrified of this woman and the fear of older women coming back (thanks stepmomster) in general. The fear that she was going to be so kind and wonderful to him and nasty and covertly manipulative in private (I did actually see this a few times up to the point where I had to had to tell FIL I couldn't visit with her anymore), her getting weird and possessive yadda yadda yadda (this is mostly from my stepmother than the other abusers). I've been dealing with panic attacks, hypervigilance, and it pains me to say this: obsessive thinking from the intrusive thoughts about losing the only family I've ever had and other issues on and off for the last 11 months. It has wrecked me.

I have mostly lurked and read through posts in the grief subreddits. The general consensus seems to be (not my situation, just other people going through the same), giver the new partner a chance, if you don't accept her you might lose him too, if you don't accept the new situation you're a ""spoiled selfish ungrateful brat"" being unsupportive of the new parent (all the stuff my FoO called me). I was brave enough to make a post (deleted it) where the person said ""hurr hurr your FIL isn't obligated to care about you"" Well no, technically he's not, but he has made it very clear, despite the horrible grief he must be going through that he in fact does care about me. He's shown it a lot actually. Right now he's rightfully giving me space after me finally saying I couldn't visit with her anymore.

I'm not at all against him dating and am not one of those unsupportive family members...at all. On the contrary. I am just TERRIFIED of the new person. I already met her. She's okay here and there but she has given off a few red flags, made symptoms worse after visits and my body has been screaming NO the entire time no matter how much I try. I have trouble telling the difference between a genuine gut reaction or if it's just a trauma response. I usually listen to my gut and I'm usually right about it but in this case I genuinely cannot tell the difference.

FIL was a bit pushy in the beginning but when he realized the extent and magnitude of what I'd been dealing with and suffering with in secret, all the stuff I didn't want to burden anybody else with, he's been respectful and giving space. My biggest fear, is that if I'm not ready nor will ever be ready, that I will lose him because of this monster of a disorder that I wish on absolutely nobody.

My own therapist is of the opinion that I should listen to my body and do what's best for my own self. Husband and her both say I consider others to a fault. I am terrified of losing my sense of family.

It feels like a death sentence and a situation I never wanted to be forced into or having to make a choice, take the space I need and potentially hurt the relationship or let myself burn and suffer to make others happy.

My therapist is on vacation rn and I guess I just need a listening ear, more opinions, and that I'm not a bad DIL because from the bottom of my heart I'm not trying to be selfish. I want him to be happy but my symptoms have become unmanagable and despite how well he's treated me husband is starting to become resentful towards his own dad because he rightfully feels stuck in the middle and seeing the full and ugly extent of my distress and panic attacks. I never meant to burden anyone.",1755063167.0,3,5,ptsd,ptsd

1mor9lo,Fear of Alcohol/Drugs,"When I was 16, one of my good friends passed away at 15. He went to a sleepover with his friends, and they decided to take LSD. While they were all tripping together, my friend wandered upstairs away from everyone else. No one checked on him the rest of the night. In the morning, one of them went upstairs and found him dead in his room. He had shot himself in the head with a gun under his mattress. He was very pro-gun, and I truly don’t think he struggled with suicidal thoughts. I tend to believe he suffered from a very bad trip of sorts. 

This was the first major death I had ever experienced. We were in class together, and his seat being empty the rest of the school year was so painful I can’t even begin to describe it. I’ve never quite felt despair like that since. 

I had a new girlfriend at the time of his death, and two weeks later was prom night. My girlfriend and I decided to smoke weed for the first time. To make a long story short, we both got high and got into a huge argument, because she kept doing things that I felt were endangering her (such as running out into the middle of the street without looking for cars at all). She seemed like a completely different person with how angry she got with me. Our friend group had to stop us from screaming at each other. I fell asleep that night in her arms and started shaking. I remember shaking for weeks after that. 

The combination of those two events made me terrified of any drugs or alcohol, fearing that they would lead my friends to hurt themselves or hurt me. I remember seeing a dab pen in public and having a visceral panic attack. These continued intensely for months. When I got to college, the panic attacks returned. I would leave parties hyperventilating, not able to stop crying.

Nowadays, I’ve made a huge recovery. The issue is I’m starting a new relationship, and he drinks a couple times a week. He’s Colombian and seems to take his alcohol well. But he admits to drinking and driving on occasion, and he’ll send me sweet messages sometimes when he’s drunk. A lot of my panic has started to return. How can I deal with the triggers without punishing my partner for living a normal life? I just want to sleep at night and stop having nightmares. :(",1755048652.0,4,3,ptsd,ptsd

1mourw9,Feeling trapped in trauma after an abusive marriage — need advice and support,"I don’t even know where to start, but I feel like my whole nervous system is stuck in fight-or-flight.

I’m currently separated from my husband (I’ll call him “Why”). Our marriage has been a cycle of control, verbal/emotional abuse, gaslighting, and manipulation. He would scream at me over small things, shift all blame for our problems onto me, and use God’s Word in twisted ways to take digs at me publicly. Even when I tried to communicate calmly, it often ended with me in tears or feeling unsafe.

I recently left the marriage and am staying with a trusted family friend, but it’s not over — he’s now restricting my visits with our kids, spreading lies about me, and trying to make me look unstable in court. I’ve kept my living space spotless, have witnesses to his abusive behavior, and I’m doing my best to hold it together, but the anxiety is constant.

The trauma shows up in my sleep too. I’ve been having intense nightmares about liminal spaces — empty malls, psych wards, strange houses — mixed with nuclear bombs going off, or being forced into unwanted surgery. I wake up feeling like I’m right back in the abuse. Even daytime flashbacks hit out of nowhere when I hear certain tones of voice or see something that reminds me of him. Sometimes it’s very specific — I’ll suddenly remember the way he would laugh in my face when I cried or got angry, or the time he responded “divorce lol” over text when I asked him what he wanted to do about our marriage.

I feel angry, sad, and guilty all at once. Sometimes I feel like I’m losing myself entirely. I’ve tried to pray, journal, and watch encouraging sermons, but the hypervigilance and sense of danger won’t go away.

If anyone has gone through something similar — especially with an abusive spouse who tries to twist the truth — how did you cope? How did you stop feeling like you’re still in the abuse even after you’ve left?

I’m just looking for reassurance, advice, or even just someone to remind me that I’m not crazy for feeling this way.

1mogmmh,Connecting with people is hell because of dissociation,"I've found myself struggling a LOT with staying with one person for long. Eventually I end up feeling so disconnected to them in a sense that they feel foreign that I wanna run away. Sometimes it feels like everyone around me is just faking their personality and the version of them that i know never even existed. I appreciate people who support me and I want to be able to love them but this glass wall that only exists for me makes it near impossible for me to respond appropriately to our interactions or even feel anything for them on many occasions. I know its not my fault but sometimes i blame myself regardless and even when i dont it's just so frustrating to feel anxious or empty around the warmest people I've ever seen. This especially affects my relationship with my partner. I don't know how to cope and considering my ptsd is also very bad I'm not even sure these symptoms would ever fully go away. Sometimes I just wanna push him away because this constant proximity-distance situation is depressing me and I also feel like he'd be better off with someone who'd at least be able to genuinely tell him they love him instead of giving him a confused look followed by something like ""ah yeah, you're nice. I like you""",1755023051.0,10,2,ptsd,ptsd
1moqm10,New to PTSD: How do I calm down?,"I had another panic attack at work today. Im a teacher going back to school for Institute days and the students start tomorrow [Wednesday]. I was sitting in my meeting for about five minutes and I felt it set in out of nowhere. I had to leave and panicked in the stairwell, crying and hyperventilating for about 15 minutes. Then took another 20 to collect myself and go back in.  I left my abuser five weeks ago but have had no panic attacks until returning to work Monday.

I was able to message my therapist about it between appointments. Now that I am back at school, in a place that feels even safer than my home, it’s sending my body into shock every morning shortly after I get there. 

I have therapy Thursday after work, but I’m wondering if anyone can give me some coping strategies to try for during the day tomorrow.

1mo6yfq,I have been diagnosed with clinical and severe PTSD.,"I know, I know it is not as bad as most if not all people in this subreddit, because I most likely deserved it. Here’s my story- 

My dad was in the military, he was in love with all military type stuff, including torture techniques, before anybody says anything, no I wasn’t tortured…. Much. All that happened was- when I was 6ish my dad lay me down on a table, strapped a T-shirt around my face, and poured ice cold water over my face, it was horrible, this did happen a few times. The worst thing he had ever done was- obvs I don’t know if anyone else has these but- around your finger nails, you have loose skin, my dad used to rip them, not off…. No no no, that would have been heaven unlike this- he ripped them down. He was an avid supporter in alcohol and he loved to drink and smash bottles and other lovely stuff, I still have marks. 

I lost a sister. He went too far one day. She was 8. I don’t remember how it happened, all I know is that….. she was my dad’s…. ‘Play thing’. She died. And I will always blame myself, I will always be worrying about that I could have saved her. 

Now- (if I may say so) now- he’s is happily dead…. Not the painful way I would have wanted but the alcohol drink caught up with him in the end. 

I am now 21, still not got a therapist, but me and my younger and older brother are alive and away from that. I was adopted at 7ish years old- 2010-12-10. 

Before you ask- my abusive mother-bitch, she abused, but not nearly as bad as what my birth dad did. She is now in jail, and last I heard…. She was stabbed, sadly not to death, but stabbed. 


If you were in this situation…. And I hope to god (and everything on earth, moon and beyond) that this or anything near to this ever happened to you or anyone you know, how would you move on.

A pill that was hard to swallow, it took me a year and 3 switches of therapist to start opening up. It went painfully slowly some sessions I could only say a couple of words. It was incredibly frustrating and draining for me. Another year went by and I was done, I just couldn’t do it anymore. It felt like we were stuck. My therapist saw my struggles and recommended intensive trauma therapy, a week where al you do is EMRD, IE, emdr sport and group sessions. It was hell on earth, multiple sessions per day busting my ass of. but by the end we had not made the breakthrough or reached the goal we wanted. But I was done, empty, tired, emotionally, and physically drained. I couldn’t do it anymore so in our evaluation I lied. I wanted to get away as fast as possible and never ever talk about it again. And I still feel that very strongly, because steering it up hurts me more than keeping it where it is now. I am still glad I quit because it feels freeing, but I also feel like I let myself down.

Before this treatment I was constantly feeling absolute dread and anxiety throughout every single day with little relief.

But recently, I’ve experienced a sudden recovery where I now rarely relive or remember my trauma and my memories of it seems fuzzy. But when I do suddenly get memories of my trauma I don’t really feel that negative and the memory just pass through in seconds with no lingering effects.

I also don’t seem to feel any negative emotions the last time I had an EMDR session.

This was really upsetting to write and share but I hope it will help my healing process. Names have been changed. Certain details have been omitted to protect anonymity. 

TW: break ups, psychiatric facilities, death, suicidal attempts, pet death, police.

Have you seen one of those movies where everything goes wrong and it's almost comical?

I survived the worst year of my life.

It started with a horrible break up with my fiancé. We had been together for 5 years. I was kicked out of my home with my fiancé, and my councilors told me that meant I was homeless. They told me I needed to be with people who care about me.

Context: I was still in a partial care facility after my first in-patient visit. I had MDD and developed severe Catatonia. After some medication to reverse the Catatonia, I was put in a partial care program. I would be in my program from 8-3 Mon-fri. This program would last at least 9 months. While there, I would go to groups and get more therapy/be under observation by trained professionals.

So, I got in contact with my family. The only person who could come get me was my uncle. He basically saved me. I moved into my grandmas, where my uncle and dad were both living. My dad was taking care of my gram, and my uncle was going through a divorce.

I moved into my grandpa's room. He died just a few months ago. It wasn't easy, but I had my cat Hasslehoff. He was my emotional support animal and comforted me. His purring could calm even the most intense panic attacks I had. 

I had to start my program at a new place, closer to where I moved. I had been with my ex for so long, the break up was not easy. My ex cheated on me and I broke up with them. But I could get through it. I realized I had to rediscover who I was before our relationship.

After a month of being at my grandma's one day my uncle collapsed. He was unresponsive. I called my dad to help me. My dad used to be a paramedic and he realized my uncle was unconscious. I called 911. While I was on the phone, my uncle stopped breathing. Me and my dad took turns giving him CPR while waiting for the ambulance. 

The EMS worked on him for an hour before they pronounced him dead. 

My uncle saved me. 
But I couldn't save him. 

It was the most traumatic thing I ever experienced. My poor grandmother had to experience losing her husband and a son within a year.

I continued my program and shared my experience. It was just too horrible. I was struggling to heal. 

My dad watched his little brother die in front of him.

It's so hard to write all of this. It's difficult to remember what happened next. 

Hasslehoff got sick. He started losing weight and coughing. I brought him to the vet, and the vet said he'd take some tests. Heard back later and learned that Hasslehoff had cancer. The vet wasn't sure what kind, maybe bone or lungs because of the coughing. 
My ESA was now slowly dying. The next month he was getting worse, he wouldn't eat anymore. He was still drinking water. The last vet visit, the vet said he was dying. I was broken. I didn't know what to do. I asked the vet if we could make Hasslehoff more comfortable. The vet offered to give him a diuretic, to help his breathing. He warned me that if he gave it to him, Hasslehoff would deteriorate very quickly. I figured that meant he would die sooner. I gave my consent. 
That night, Hasslehoff's back legs stopped working. He still crawled into the litter box to use it one last time. I was just constantly crying. By 1am he was howling and looked afraid. I put him on the bed with me, in his usual place and cuddled him. 
Hasslehoff was only ten years old and I adopted him when he was a kitten.
So I was shocked when he suddenly bit my arm. Hard. It wasn't a nip it was an aggressive chomp. All four fangs punctured my skin deep. And he wasn't letting go. I was flabbergasted and shook. I didn't understand why he just did that. I looked into his eyes but his pupils were huge, and he didn't even look at me. He was looking through me. He was blind, he couldn't see me. 
He was dying. I started crying more and tried to pry his mouth off my arm. In the process he bit my thumb and I held him back. I struggled to process what to do. Why was he biting ME? Why me? As I watched him, I felt like he was asking me for help. Was he panicking? Was he actively dying and afraid? Was his brain failing and he was lashing out without realizing? I don't know. All I knew was that I loved him so much and I didn't want him to suffer anymore. 
I loved my cat with my entire soul. And when I tell you I could not imagine my future without him, perhaps you can understand why I attempted to unalive myself after he died. I just wanted to follow him into the beyond. I'm crying as I write this. It was the hardest thing I had to experience. I sliced open both my arms and held his limp body and cried myself asleep.

I was confused when I woke up. I was not dead and I had to face the brutal reality. I didn't tell anyone that I attempted to unalive myself. I told my friends and family that Hasslehoff died. I washed my blood off his fur the next day.

Then the police showed up at my door. They had questions about Hasslehoff. They had an anonymous tip about a suspicious animal death. Suspicious? Anonymous? Wtf? I had only told my closest friends and family about Hasslehoff dying. Wtf was so suspicious about that? 

So I ended up having to go to the police station to tell them about what happened to Hasslehoff. Then they asked about my dad's dog. She had been sick and also died that night. 

Wtf was going on? The Police thought I killed our pets? What the f? Who called the police?! 

No one called the police to do a wellness check. It was not a wellness check, it was an arrest. They took my damn cat and accused me of animal cruelty! I had proof my cat was sick from going to the vet for months. We had proof the dog was sick and my dad vouched for me. 

My family didn't call the police. It was one of my fucking 'friends'. 

I've never had a history of animal abuse or neglect or anything. I've never had a history of violence or anger. This just came out of left field, no warning. Animal control took my cat as 'evidence'.

I told the police everything. How I attempted suicide and showed them my cuts and the bites. The police tried to twist  it like I killed my cat and the bites were defensive wounds. I was enraged.

They handcuffed me to a metal bench for about 7 hours. I don't know why it took so long. Someone actually brought me a piece of cold pizza. Then the psych bus came. They put me in a 48 hour suicide watch instead of jail. 

Who the fuck called the police?! It was eating me up inside. It's all I could think about the whole time I was in the psych hold. When I got home I shut down my social media. No one would ever know the details of my life again.

A week later, my grandma died. I left the house to get coffee and when I came home they were taking her out of the house on a stretcher. My dad asked 'where were you?' In the most heart-breaking voice. 

I wish I didn't get coffee on that day.
I wish I had been with my dad.
He told me he found grandma unresponsive and checked her. She wasn't breathing and he had to give her CPR and call the ambulance. He was all alone. I was so mad at myself.

The house was in grandma's name. Both me and my dad had to find a new place to live. 

I was going to be homeless again. 

My grandma was like my other parent growing up. She stepped up when my dad was drunk or getting high. It crushed me when she died.

All of this tragedy happened within the span of a year. It was too much. I felt alone, no friends that I felt I could trust. The pain was too much. I planned a second suicide attempt. I would make sure my dad didn't have to find me. I wouldn't take the car. I would walk to a public place and take all my sleep pills. I'd just fall asleep. 
So I put my pills in my pocket and started walking. I held the bottle in my hand. I didn't care how cold it was outside, I'd be dead soon.
But half way there my legs just stopped working.
I didn't really have an epiphany. My legs just stopped. I was just in a daze. I walked home, completely numb physically and emotionally.

I was faced with the legal fallout from the animal abuse bullshit. I wanted to plead innocent but it was the state verses me. My appointed attorney told me it would be better to plead guilty and do some kind of deal. So I did a pre-trial program and allegedly because I have no record and I've never been arrested before (first offense), it would be purged from my record. Because that's how Justice is in my country. It doesn't matter if you're innocent or guilty. All that mattered is that someone called the police.
So thankfully I talked to my public defender, and I asked to look at my case file. I could finally find out who the fuck called the police. 
It had been my 'best friend'. This person had been my absolute best friend for seventeen years, we went on vacations together, did a ceremony to become spiritual family (even had our blood mixed together in a vial as a symbol), I was the person of honor at their wedding. Like BEST FRIEND. I even took care of THEIR PETS when they were moving. 
Why would this person call the police? Why would they think I'd torture/maim/murder my beloved ESA? 
To this day I have no closure.
To this day I don't know why.
So, I had two years of reporting to a parole officer every month just to tell them I wasn't abusing any animals (and I couldn't even have any pets during that time). 
I had to move out of my grandma's home. My dad moved far away to live with his girlfriend. I moved out of state as well and moved in with my mom. 

I'm still trying to recover from that terrible year. I'm surprised I survived. I really didn't want to. In retrospect I'm glad I survived. I've had a child since then.

There is only so much trauma someone can take. You never know what someone has been through. Always be kind to each other and treat each other with compassion and consideration. 

Update: I still get treatment for my MDD and Catatonia. I still see a therapist and take medication to manage my symptoms. I am stable and not in danger of self harm.",1755044529.0,1,1,ptsd,ptsd
1moisok,Having trouble letting go of a situation from kindergarten,"I don't think there are any CW for this but just to be safe, I'm gonna say bullying and a small instance of violence towards a child.


When I was in kindergarten, I had a music teacher that 90% of students loved.  I was a very well behaved child so I was usually liked by teachers as well.  However this teacher was different.  On one instance I accidentally stepped on his toe and he in response stomped on mine very hard and I started crying.  This isn't even the incident I'm referring to in the title. 

I was also bullied a lot in kindergarten (and all of school).  My worst bully was another girl in my class.  She was the most popular and she bullied me in that fake mean girl way of pretending to be my friend but also insulting me, excluding me, taking my stuff, starting rumors, etc.

When the end of year concert came around, I auditioned for and got a solo.  I'm not gonna name the song for privacy reasons but I'd say it's as common as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  I was so excited.  I told my entire family and I practiced everyday in front of my class.  Everyone knew it was my solo.  The night of the concert however, in front of the entire school and my family, my music teacher called my bully to sing my solo instead.  I was stood on stage in front of everyone confused and devastated.  I had to hold it together so I wasn't the kid that had a break down during the concert.  My parents afterwards also didn't give me the comfort/space to cry about it afterwards so I never really dealt with it.  To this day, I hate that song.   Hearing it makes me feel embarrassed and like I'm on that stage again.  I also developed terrible stage fright.  I love singing but I don't have the confidence to do so in front of many people.  I have a huge issue with feeling rejected because that's how I felt that day.  It was mortifying.  Most people I talk about this with don't seem to see why it affects me so much.  But I was already a kid with self esteem issues so this really broke me.  I guess I just wanted to talk about it here and ask am I being too sensitive for having lasting effects from this?  Has anyone else gone through something similar?  I've always felt so alone with this because I don't think there's many teachers cruel enough to do this to a 5 year old.  I'm 25 now and I still remember that moment like it was yesterday.  ",1755027820.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd
1mo1o2w,Just found out I was misdiagnosed as bipolar when I actually have PTSD,"I was with my new psychiatrist for well over an hour when I had a simple 45 minute appointment so he could explain it all to me (in what little time we had) and my head is still reeling. 

I'm relieved, to be honest, because he was genuinely excited that he can help me. And before I felt so helpless, I *was* helpless as nothing was working. But this is all so new, I've spent the last ten years with a bipolar diagnosis (first bipolar depression and then bipolar 2 three years ago) and was put on Lithium along with some other medications later on down the line like Wellbutrin. 

With the way he explained it, I believe him. He's right. He had me explain my symptoms and he'd ask if I had specific symptoms and I did. Apparently all of those symptoms match the criteria for PTSD but not bipolar. 

I was also misdiagnosed with ADHD, I guess it's actually OCD that has stemmed from the PTSD. My new psychiatrist is confident that he can help me. Next appointment in a few weeks he'll be changing my meds and we'll be talking more about EMDR therapy. 

I don't know how to feel. Relieved mostly, a little (lot) scared, and I have so many questions still that will hopefully be answered next appointment. I don't really know what I'm looking for posting here, to be honest. Has this happened to anyone else?

If you've been diagnosed as bipolar before being diagnosed with PTSD instead, how did you handle it? I've spent the last decade thinking I'm something that I'm not. My mind is going absolutely wild right now. 

I'm relieved, excited, and absolutely terrified. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow to do the paperwork for the SMI program and I've been told I'm a good candidate. My whole world is changing, and while I hate change with a passion I hope I can accept this one. 

If anyone has any kind words of support or stories, I would be so grateful and appreciative to read them. ❤️

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, I'm sorry if it's everywhere. It's difficult to collect my thoughts right now but for the first time in years, I don't think it's in a bad way. Just a new one. 

If I don't respond right away I'm sorry, it's nighttime for me and I really should be in bed haha. ",1754981714.0,21,41,ptsd,ptsd
1mooibp,PTSD/CPTSD?,"So this is my first ever post on Reddit, I’m currently going through a tough period in my life that I’ll get to in this post. I am 19M turning 20 in October. I’m making this post because I honestly want to know if anyone has any answers or ideas.

It all started when I was a baby my father wasn’t very present while I was growing up I was in South Africa while he tried to build myself and my mother a home/future in the UK I was around 1-2 years old when he was out there when I saw him again I didn’t recognise him from what my parents had told me. Throughout school I was relentlessly bullied for stupid things like if my shorts were too short/long if my hair wasn’t cut the same as anyone else’s, if I liked something else other people didn’t like for example I’ve always really been into cartoons and comics but when I was younger no one really liked that or had mutual interests with me i always felt like an outsider (that could also be because I grew up in a migrant household) 

When I was 6 my mother fell pregnant with my younger brother, while she was pregnant she fell really ill, she suffered from psychosis and depression while she was in hospital with my brother my father and I were unsure if she would make it home we didn’t think she would survive. Multiple times a week I was talking to my dying mum not thinking if I’d be able to see her again thankfully she made it through. The things that I saw and experienced in that time have forever stuck with me I can picture how my mum looked at any point of any day almost as if it happened yesterday. I looked to my dad for help but his only advice/help was “man up” or “stop being so sensitive” “stop being a pussy” “stop crying” etc.

Once mum was back from the hospital I got 0 attention from my parents all focus was on my little brother, mum was still really ill I read a suicide note that was in very similar handwriting to hers but nothing ever came from it. All attention was on my little brother my parents didn’t pay any attention to me apart from cooking me dinner. Growing up through school I learned to fight back like I mentioned earlier I was relentlessly bullied but I learned that if I fight back at school then I’d get phone calls home and my parents would have no choice but to give me attention I didn’t care whether if it was good or bad attention at least they would talk to me. I abused this newly found information my parents would get 5-6 phone calls home a week because I was beating kids up at school, causing problems etc. I’d never hit first but I’d get them to hit me first so I can hit back.

When I was around 12-13 years old my dad started hitting me a lot after school then blaming me for him doing it, my mum asked me to not press charges on my dad on more than one occasion, I didn’t know what to do I can still feel to this day his fists meeting my face, his hand around my neck and him slamming my head into a wall. I grew to resent him and be scared of him, dad was hitting me at home so I thought I’d take that out on people at school. It didn’t end well. 

Nothing of importance comes to mind from that point until I’m 15. I met this girl throughout school for anyone in the UK reading this I was in year 10. This girl and I got on like a house on fire I had girlfriends before they weren’t serious serious I was cheated on before I got with this girl. We were dating for about a year. She SA’d me. 
She did things to me while I wasn’t awake and then would blame it on me when I’d ask her about it, I told my mother about it and I split up with the girl but we still stayed in contact. One night she came over to my house and my mother forced me to get back with her after I was begging her to not make me do this because I was terrified she’d hurt me again and she did, she SA’d me a second time at least this time I was awake. I immediately broke up with her. Not even 3 days later she was already dating someone new, she falsely accused me of rape, told people I was racist,homophobic and told them my secrets. Her brothers and mother threatened me with prison time/pressing charges. All my “friends” turned on me I lost everyone close to me in less than a week I had no one. I took a risk and tried to talk to my parents about how I was feeling I was told to move on and get over it. 

Now fast forward a bit I’ve been consistent in the gym lifting over 100kg on bench (110kg for 2 reps to be exact) it helped me deal with these thoughts and pictures I had in my head that I didn’t understand. I then decided to take another risk and try get involved romantically with someone, yeah she ended up cheating on me with her ex, so I waited a few months to heal and tried again this time this girl ended hitting me everytime she was mad at me, anytime I didn’t do what she liked she’d hit me but I felt trapped I wasn’t getting love from anywhere even tho it wasn’t good this girl was my only source of affection. Yeah it ended about as well as you could expect. 

So now after being cheated on 3 times and physically abused all by separate people I decided to give women a break and this is where it got pretty bad, one of my really close friends lets call him Paul. Me Paul and a couple other people went to a rave they’ve gone to raves before but this was my first one and this was the first time I took MDMA I took so much I started hallucinating. Towards the end of the night (last hour of the venue being open) Paul had a seizure I had him in my arms holding him close telling him he’s going to be okay and within an instant he stopped moving from seizing uncontrollably, thankfully he survived but I was certain he died right there in my arms, after that I didn’t have any support from anyone I didn’t know who I could turn to but I wasn’t sleeping I wasn’t eating everytime I closed my eyes I could see Paul and I was right back where I was when it happened. Me and Paul aren’t friends anymore. 

Couple months later dad put his hands on me again and my entire family blamed me for it, he was shouting and swearing at me calling me every name under the sun “fuck you” “you stupid cunt” “you little shit” “you aren’t any son of mine you fucking idiot” so I decided that for once I’d put my hands on him first I only pushed him that’s when he grabbed me by my throat and did his signature hitting my head into a solid wall move my mother got in the way of us so I wasn’t able to throw a punch I couldn’t risk hurting her.

After that me and dad were still very hot headed especially after I was blamed for it all and his behaviour was excused everyone defended him apart from my little brother. A few months after that I had another really good friend of mine someone I considered one of my closest friends almost kill himself infront of me

I run my own business and he asked me for work and I was aware of his drug taking issues but he was one of my closest friends I told him my only rules/boundaries for him to work with me was that he must NOT be high when he’s working with me. Yeah well he told me how high he was and I sent him home I then get all these messages about how he’s gonna kill himself and that he’s sorry, thank you for being my friend, I’ve had a good run etc.
I go to his house after calling an ambulance and the second I get there there’s blood everywhere on the walls on the floor in the bathroom, hallway up the stairs it was insane. He’s alive and made it through but he’s still taking drugs heavily.

Now up to date today is 13/08/25 my current girlfriend is away travelling in Thailand and I have lost a friend I have had for the best part of my life (10+ yrs) that isn’t my friend anymore, I’ve lost the ones I have spoken about in this post and then some. Me and my gf have had some problems while she’s away but nothing even remotely close to what I have dealt with in the past. 

This is the part that I want answers or any sort of help with, I can’t not see my dying mother on a daily basis, I can’t feel my dad still hitting me and the things he’s said to me have stuck with me like they’re almost engraved into me, my parents have apologised for “abandoning and neglecting me as a child” - their words not mine. I have tried therapy I don’t even know how many times, I’ve smoked weed to try get these thoughts/pictures out of my head, tried shrooms to try heal, been in the gym, working 60hr+ weeks I run businesses I work harder than anyone I know but no matter what I do helps me change how I feel, I don’t have a sense of accomplishment or fulfilment. I don’t accept or believe the “good” things that get said about me I can’t say anything good about myself and my gf gets annoyed at me when I speak “badly” to myself but this is all I’ve ever known. I raised myself and am dealing with all these pictures and voices going round and round in my head my mother is a mental health nurse and she says she thinks I have ptsd my gfs mother has also said she thinks so and the people I used to be friends with think I do to but I don’t like to say I have something without a diagnosis. I have these flashbacks and nightmares probably 4-5 times a week by flashbacks i literally mean I am right back where I was in whatever moment I’m having flashbacks over.

So if anyone has any ideas or can help with anything to make me feel better, get over trauma or to even help with my self esteem it’d be greatly appreciated ",1755041197.0,1,4,ptsd,ptsd
1moeqmr,"My Story. TLDR. How I came to be, full story.","My story. TW Abuse, Feral child, firearm use abandonment and for some political factors.

Please forgive any disjointedness. I had a pretty rough episode last night. 


  Alright. I've been on the sub for a few days. I've felt around a little, and while I have mentioned bits and pieces but here we go, the long dark dive into it all so to speak. Im 45, male, and I live and grew up in Romania, and I am Romani, That might not seem important but it is. I grew up under a political regime that was not great to us and I don't know what their own status was but my parents were decent people, life wasn't so bad for a while. 

 I was 8 at the time and I remember a knock at our home door. My mother told go me to my room and hide. This was normal for me. I always knew my parents were people who did something secret to me, I never knew until I was older they were labeled political dissidents due to activism, so when people would come over, if they weren't friends, I'd hide. So I did again this time like normal.

This time though, I could hear voices. Stern men. I heard the yelling start. Something glass broke, my father started shouting No No No!!. Then I heard the two shots. I didn't know what they were at the time. I heard the voices fade away a car door close and it pull away. It took me almost 4 hours before I came out. I didn't hear my parents signal so I didn't come out, Those were the rules. But 4 hours was long and I was getting hungry. 

 That's when I saw it. My parents. My father, missing half his face, my mother was face down on the floor. I didn't bother to roll her over I vomited and passed out. 

I remember waking up later. What day it was how long I'd slept I have no clue. But I was starving. My parents bodies were still there. Undisturbed, so I knew at that point no one cared.  I stayed long enough to orient myself , grab food and run. I had always been told what to do in an emergency but no one expects the real fire, just the drill experience. I knew this was bad. I knew I couldn't trust the police, for all I know the police did it. I fled to some friends of my mother's in the same community.  They despite being family, and if you know Romani we are all family to some extent. They turned me out not wanting to bring my parents ""curse"" down on them. 

 I ended up in abandoned areas, woods, old abandoned homes,  sleeping in the dirt, eating out of garbage cans, I did some pretty base things to survive. I forgot/chose not to speak, what sounds I did make were grunts and howls, I viewed myself a nothing more than a forgotten cur and my survival instincts said the same. 

At the age of 16 I was caught. By a Priest. Eating out of the churches trash. They took me in. Reported to missing persons when I wasn't listed they took me in. It was abusive physically, in order to get me to come back to being ""Civilized"" they called it To be a man like God wanted not a lowly beast in the dirt. I managed to gain back most of my language and become less wild but at a heavy hand. I managed to cope with this for a while. Yes I wake up outdoors, a lot, I sleepwalk still, but I always found a way to keep it in control. A few odd explanations but nothing I couldn't brush off with a I drank too much excuse except I've never really drank. 

Then about 10 months ago I had my incident. I was in a situation where I was getting bombarded with questions about my parents and that wild feral nature came back with a vengeance. I blacked out.  It was explained to me later that I was non verbal, growling, howling, clawing and even tried to bite someone. Well that brought it to a forced attention. Since then I've struggled to find a doctor or someone that truly understands even just to talk to. ",1755018952.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd

1mobqhp,Best Response to Rage,"My PTSD person has brief but intense bouts of rage that can be spurred by the most minor things — a wrapper falling out of a trash can, a random comment, whatever. They will literally scream all sorts of hurtful comments, threats, hateful thoughts, at anyone unfortunate enough to have done the thing, and anyone else. A half hour later, it’s like they have awakened from a nightmare, and have calmed down. 

These episodes usually come about after special stress of some kind, like pain or anxiety-provoking situations… they don’t “ just happen.” So they are somewhat predictable. 

Those of you with PTSD, who have anger issues related to that… how do you want loved ones and others to respond to you when you are in this situation? 

I never know what to do. If I say I’m sorry, I get screamed at. If I try to defend myself, I get screamed at. If I suggest my person call her therapist, I get screamed at. If I say nothing, I get screamed at; although this has become my default response, because frankly I’m burned out… and I have my own health issues I need to attend to, and have to maintain calm. 

Should I physically remove myself from the area? No drama; just say that I’m stepping out for a few minutes? Should I tell the person to snap out of it? Should I continue to just wait out these rage- bursts?

It started as nausea, then bled into me occasionally getting sick after eating, leading to eating less in general. Eventually the episodes would kick up into well actual episodes - physically sick even before/long after ive eaten, convulsing, short spurts of passing out, fatigue, dry heaving/gagging when nothing else to throw up. the frequency also picked up. To happening every so often, practically  once a day, then throughout full days, then days up to weeks at a time with no relief in between unless i can sleep. I have been to many doctors, er, urgent care. i have mostly been told i eother have norovirus or chs. i cannot have has norovirus for close to 4 years and I have stopped the smoking as directed with no improvements. I am in therapy and psychiatry. I have discussed the sickness with both, tried and discussed meds before
i have many years experience with a variety of anti anxiety/depression/panic meds. none benefited me more than harmed unfortunately. i am on the same birth control patch i have been on since around 15 years old for hormone balancing. I have endometriosis and have had 2 past surgeries to remove the growths. I have at this point lost a job due to my sickness and severity. I have just recently after months found a new one in my new town. the sickness has slowed some but not enough and even with tums, dramamine, zofran, sniffing rubbing alcohol, small cold sips of water, and walking around. I wasn’t able to avoid getting an episode at work on my first. day. i lasted 4/8 hours and held off for about an hour before it decided for me instead. I made it to the bathroom and tried to get myself calmed so i could work it off but i couldn’t stop shaking, sweating, or gagging. I had woken up hours early today to eat and give myself time to be sick just in case. I made it in and was enjoying finally working again so much. i can’t express much i’ve cried since i left today
i am so ashamed and embarrassed and just feeling very small. i have worked and provided for myself for a long time. I fortunately have a partner who has seen the entire decline and has supported me through out it all. im so thankful but i WANT to work, help provide, have my own source of income. Im not sure working in location anywhere is going to work for me for a while. not until i can manage this sickness i have. I have yet to visit a gastroenterologist, neurologist, or EMDR therapist.

1mo6uu5,Alcohol and trauma,"CW: suicide, drinking, SA

I've been struggling with PTSD for over a year, possibly two but I was diagnosed in February of 2024 when I was hospitalized for an attempt.

I know I had C-PTSD from childhood trauma but the acute PTSD symptoms came after I went through a series of events between 2023 and 2024 where I had a falling out with an old friend, entered a tumultuous relationship and survived an attempt, the ICU and and assault. 

I've always used alcohol to regulate, to sedate, to escape and to cope. My use of substances is circunstancial, I don't have a dependency but I will drink and smoke when things get too hard to cope with sober. I don't get too drunk when this is the case. I'll drink one to three beers max once or twice per week when things are truly bad. My ex called me an alcoholic for using alcohol to keep my emotions at bay, trying not to react with anger or sorrow when she yelled at me, punished me, etc. 

I no longer use alcohol in this way, since I begun treatment for PTSD I've allowed myself to feel and express my emotions freely. However, when I drink for fun in a social setting, I have, from time to time drank more than I intended to, not even noticing how drunk I am until it's too late. This happens when I'm in new environments or with new people — social settings do make me quite nervous. 

I drank a bit too much on an outing a month ago and I ended up staying away from my group for 15 minutes, without my phone with me. My best friend got really worried and told me that I'm an alcoholic and shouldn't drink anymore. Another friend of mine also expressed concerned but the major reason they cite is that I got assaulted after a stranger took advantage of my vulnerable state (I was freshly out of the hospital) and coerced me into drinking every drink he offered me until I was too intoxicated to fight back.

I don't think it's fair for my friends to use my assault as a reason as to why I shouldn't be trusted with my own body and what I put in it. I rarely ever drink now and when I do, most of the time I have one or two beers at most. The cases in which I've gone overboard are few and far between and I don't think I need to be stone cold sober just because a man much larger and stronger than me used alcohol as one of the many tools he applied to make sure he could get anything he wanted from me without me fighting back. Alcohol was just one of the factors that made me vulnerable and it's not even the biggest one since I've been drunk since and have had men try to get me into bed and I've been able to firmly reject them (I haven't needed to run away or use force but I think this is because when I left the hospital I was severely underweight and now I've gained over 10 kg of mostly muscle mass and I think I seem stronger, more masculine and more grown up to other men. I looked the same way I did when I was 14 when I first left the hospital.)

I'm tired of people treating me like a child. Some will treat me like a spoiled brat who needs discipline, others like a vulnerable thing they can exploit and manipulate and others like a poor fragile broken bird who needs parenting. None will just offer care and nurture without patronizing me which is what I would actually need. I'm nearly 30 years old. I'm tired. ",1755000296.0,2,2,ptsd,ptsd

1mo3h4f,PTSD nightmares hit when I am in a good mood,"I was diagnosed with PTSD about 3 years ago. I went through >!physical abuse, sexual abuse, child neglect, religious trauma, and I have experienced multitude of severe traumatic events at a young age with little to no actual mental support!< 

I'm now an adult and doing way better. I have an amazing support system with my soon to be husband, but I notice the days I am elated are the days I get ""similar vibe"" trauma nightmares. It's never reliving the event. It's usually adjacent. For example tonight I woke up to a nightmare that I tried to bring my childhood cat into this future timeline and she died again in a very similar traumatic way to the way she died in reality. 

I feel horrible waking up my fiance during these nightmares since he's very much a ""Once I'm awake, I'm awake."" So I guess I am looking for mutual support/people who know what I'm talking about with the ""similar dreams"" or notice if nightmares happen to them the happier they are. It's annoying that it feels like even if I am well aware I am good, my body will still go into fight or flight.

1mnyj5a,Anyone else struggle with victim mentality / victim complex?,"


It’s so disturbing that my mind operates this way but I sometimes want to KMS just so they can feel bad for what they did to me. Is this because i have a victim mentality/victim complex? I grew up in a household where I was *never* able to be the victim in *any* situation. 

I grew up with really shitty parents. untreated BPD mom and narcissistic dad. Psychotic older brother. Me being the youngest in the family, i always felt so fucking hopeless, helpless and powerless being surrounded by these type of people.

They can verbally, emotionally and physically abuse me but the moment I cry or show *any* reaction/emotion, i’m the crazy bitch in their eyes. Me crying always made them even more angry, its like me being hurt by their abuse triggered them. 

Clearly everyone in my household is just fucked in the head and it only left me feeling desperate to be treated like the victim for once. 

“Are you okay?” “I’m sorry.” ….. is all i wanted to ever hear. Now i’m constantly in a state of mind where i’m just like “I bet they’ll only realize it once i KMS” “This is the only way they’ll feel bad for me.” I’m *that* desperate for sympathy. empathy. for someone to actually feel bad for me.

1mnvt37,Hearing loud noises in the house at night,"CW: threat themes 

I keep hearing loud noises at night, sometimes when trying to sleep, sometimes when wide awake. PTSD has been really bad this year and over the last few weeks this has been happening. I was convinced I was just misinterpreting what I was hearing (eg maybe it’s outside and I think it’s inside) but now I can’t actually tell if they’re real or just hallucinations. 

I hear doors slamming in my house (except they’re open when I check), knocking, footsteps on the stairs, sounds of the window being opened and blinds being pushed aside. There’s only me and my dog here. She sleeps through the noises but wakes at the slightest noise I make which makes me wonder if they’re maybe just not really happening. I used to hear these noises a few years back - plates breaking, a ruckus downstairs. I was convinced the house had been broken into but nothing at all. I realised just today that was during a really bad PTSD period too. 

It’s always a sound that makes me think ‘I’m going to get attacked again.’

I can’t sleep. I’m on such high alert. I heard two loud ones today while wide awake and only just started wondering if I am hallucinating ?? I’ve heard of hypnogogic hallucinations but often these are when I’m wide awake. And they’re indistinguishable from normal sounds to me. I’

1mntkkc,Can you have ptsd or something adjacent from medical stuff?,"To preface this I don’t think I have ptsd whatsoever. I also don’t mean to offend anyone who actually does and I know how bad it really can be. That being said, I had cancer when I was 3-4. I’m grateful to have survived, though it came with some flaws. Besides my stunted growth, the medicine I had to take when I had cancer somehow messed with my teeth/gums. I still don’t understand how those correlate, but my doctors say it’s definitely something to do with having cancer when I was younger. 

Anyway, I’m 16 now but late last year I had to have every single one of my teeth extracted from my mouth and replaced with dentures. I’m actually humiliated to be this way but it wasn’t for cosmetic reasons or anything, it had to be done. And hopefully I’ll get implants soon. But basically I’ve had two surgeries within the past year. The first one was something I would say had a big impact. I couldn’t eat or drink or speak or breathe correctly. I couldn’t take my medication, and when I did I would vomit it right back out along with any food I had managed to get down. I had to be taken to the ER like twice where they were actually pretty rude and let me tell you I’ve had so many IV’s in my skin but one I had at the ER was actually excruciating. 

Anyway that was awful and then I had to repeat it all again when I had a second surgery in June of this year. Like I said, I don’t want to throw any serious terms around, but any time I smell (rubbing) alcohol, or anything medical, see some stupid ass needle, or see, smell, hear anything medical or hospital related, I will either freak out or cry. Like just the other day I tried some jambalaya from my aunt’s plate and i guess they cooked it weird or something because for some reason it gave me this awful medicinal taste that strongly reminded me of medicines I had to take after my surgeries. I had to excuse myself and I vomited and cried, of course. 

Anyway I am extremely sorry if this is offensive or insensitive in any way. Please let me know and I will take it down. I also apologize for how long it is. Please do not be angry with me, just let me know if this post is not appropriate or does not abide with any rules. Thank you.

For me what was most triggering I think was the lack of control I felt about so much change and feeling out of control triggered me so much, Also im a survivor or physical, emotional and sexual abuse and have associated people with danger like many other survivors so being around SO MANY unknown people triggered my body into fight or flight severely. I felt so exposed and vulnerable like I was a lamb walking amongst a pack of wolves even though nobody in college made me feel unsafe but my mind automatically assumes people are dangerous no matter what. 

 Even though my trauma wasn’t happening again logically, my body felt so triggered I was having flashbacks and panic attacks every hour, was waking up every 3 hours with severe severe nightmares it was horrible.  

Thankfully after I  dropped out I moved in with my friend and his family who are amazing people and living in a non abusive environment healed me a lot over the past year and though ptsd is still a huge part of my life im better.

1mnme27,Resources for non-emergent spiral?,"I feel ridiculous writing this, but I’m trying to figure out the correct resources for this situation.

I have OCD and PTSD. I’m in therapy and my therapist rocks and she’s encouraged me to email when needed but doesn’t do crisis sessions (totally cool with that! yay work-life balance). I’m still fairly new to the therapy process and us starting to talk about my trauma is totally messing with me.

The past 2 weeks I’ve started doubting everything. The accuracy of my memories, if I’m faking my current issues, if I’ve always just been desperate for attention and invented all of my symptoms. I’ve been searching around the clock for proof that my trauma happened, but there’s none. Everything got deleted years ago. And I know that there never will be, but I can’t accept it. I recognize this is a rough combination of OCD and PTSD, but I feel like a lost cause considering I’m getting *worse* after starting therapy and not better. I’m scared she’s going to give up and transfer me. I’m scared to even go back to therapy next week because I’m afraid I’m just a fraud.

Anyways. I’m spiraling. I tried to call 988 and spoke to a fairly rude person for about 20 seconds before hanging up out of embarrassment. I called our non emergency PD a few weeks ago and that was really helpful and they sent someone out to help me regulate since I wasn’t in a safe space, but I’m too embarrassed to use that again. I hate texting, so I don’t want to use a warm line. I did email my therapist, but she didn’t answer this time (again, totally okay) and I’m worried it’s because I utilized her between sessions one too many times and she’s finally annoyed with me (yay abandonment issues). But I’m also worried if I keep spiraling, reality won’t exist for me anymore and I’ll end up in a really bad place. I struggle with dissociation and derealization already so I’m scared and don’t trust my brain.

Who do I go to for this? I’m afraid this won’t ever get better- surely you shouldn’t get *worse* in therapy, right? We’re still working on medication management. I’m so frustrated and tired.",1754940025.0,2,3,ptsd,ptsd

On a super innocent picnic we had and she just made some sexual comments about my breasts and what she wants to do with them…She said her husband is also alright with her perusing things outside their marriage. Then she said she found me & my husband attractive…. I’m both really grossed out and don’t know what to do? It must be that they’re swingers but I had no idea! 

For reference, I’m a newly wed and my partner and I have a great sex life. She’s been married for 10+ years and her husband never wants to have sex with her. So I get the frustration, but I don’t understand the sudden proposition. 

I’m super monogamous btw and when I told my husband he couldn’t stop laughing. He advised me to just act like I never heard it and move on. Should I just avoid her? She’s one of my few friends I made in a new country where I don’t speak the language…..so sometimes she helps me with communication when we go out/ at appointments etc. so I am reliant on her in a way.

I have C-PTSD from childhood trauma and my most debilitating symptom is severe dissociation, a constant feeling of being numb and living behind a pane of glass. After trying other treatments, I found that Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN). The theory is that LDN could block the brain's natural opioids that are causing this protective numbness, potentially allowing me to feel present again. I'm hopeful, but also terrified of the side effect being flooded by past trauma which I've pretty much made peace with.
I'm looking for personal experiences from the community. If you've tried LDN for C-PTSD or dissociation, I would be grateful to hear how it went for you. Did it help with the numbness, and how did you manage the emotions that came up?
I  am afraid to tell my psychiatrist tho. I want to try it as it could allow me to finally feel with all my senses. Thanks 🙏

One day, we were laying in bed watching moana, and he made some kind of sexual joke. I wasn't stupid, I knew what it meant, I had discovered explicit things online beforehand. I laughed along, and at the time nothing felt really wrong, because itbwas just a joke. But something happened, I can't remember exactly how, but we ended up laying in the closet. He put his hand down my pants, and then wanted me to do the same to him. I obliged, I can't recall how I felt exactly, but I never said no.

My mother came in, and we swore that we had done nothing at all.

Fast forward, not too long after, we visited again. It was weird to see him again, but I just wanted to hang out like we had before, playing legos and such. 

We were left alone in the room, playing some kind of warrior cats game irl, when one of us suggested some kind of challenge. See how long we can stay in the dark. I don't know which of us reccomended it, but soon enough we were laying on the bed, in the complete dark. He had locked the door beforehand. 

Things started to get weird again, and eventually, he told me I should touch his ykw. I knew it was wrong, I knew I shouldn't have done it. Bt I was curious, and didn't want to say no. I ended up j\*rking him off, which felt so gross. But I wanted him to be happy? Then he wanted to go further. I was nervous, I didn't know what to do, and I hate myself for not just saying no. It wasn't rape, because I said it was alright. I wish I hadn't.

He didn't fully... penetrate. ew that sounds weird ew, but I didn't want him to go in fully. It felt gross? I don't know.

He kept saying how he wanted me to use my mouth, but I didn't want to do anything else. He also had me show him my.. naked form. ew why can't I say anything normally. Anyways.

After it all, we came out of the room and my cousins and sister were suspicious. They were like ""Uhuh, right.."" and laughed it off. I emember being scared I was gonna have to have a baby afyer that, I was terrified. I didn't know what you had to actually fully do to get to that point.

I can't look at him anymore. I can't say or hear his name without remembering it. If I had one chance to change something i've done, that would be it. He's my COUSIN. I feel disgusting, disgusted in myself. I can't even blame him, he was a kid too. Apparntly nownhe's gonr a little crazy I guess, I havent seen him in the past years. I cant beibg myself to anyways. I hate that I ruined our relationship as cousins. 

If you read al of this thank you, I know I talk a lot, but I don't want to leavr things out that coildbe important. ",1754896301.0,9,10,ptsd,ptsd
1mnaz52,My story,"
Hey, I hope you’re doing okay.
The reason I’m writing this is to show everyone out there suffering from PTSD that you are not alone.

Childhood Trauma

I’m a 20-year-old male now, but my childhood was… rough.
When my parents were still together, I was maybe 7–10 years old. They fought almost every single day for years.
At the time, I didn’t know I had ADHD, but my emotions were always dialed up to 100 and I’ve always had what people call a “highly sensitive” brain. I had catastrophic thoughts like “everyone is going to leave the planet without me”, “a plane is going to crash into our house”, or constant worry that someone was going to get hurt or die and begging my parents to stick together and convince them to never fight every night.

The fights between my parents filled me with so much anxiety I can’t even describe it. I remember stomach pains so bad I had to go to the hospital. I always felt sorry for my dad because my mom started fights about random things almost every day, and I could see him breaking down, drinking more. His mother (my grandmother) died when he was only around 30, and she wasn’t old — I can still see in his eyes that it broke something inside him.

After the divorce, both my parents started seeing new partners. My mom’s new boyfriend… he did some messed-up things. We moved to his place in another town, so I had to change schools — that’s when I fell into criminal activity with new friends. One of the scariest moments of my life happened there:
One day my mom and her boyfriend were fighting (again). I was in my room with my older sister when we heard them yelling. Suddenly, he opened his gun cabinet, said he was going to kill himself, and took his rifle outside. He blocked the door with heavy soil bags so I couldn’t follow him. I heard a shot from behind the barn — my heart dropped. I thought he was dead. Then he came back in, all of us crying in shock. I ran up to him, hitting him, screaming, while he cried and apologized. I can still hear my mom screaming and my baby sister crying on the floor. It was… disturbing beyond words.

PTSD — Kidnapped and robbed

One day after my 15th birthday, I was hanging out with a “friend” who spent time with three older guys 18–22 years old. I’d smoked weed with them before, but this time was different. They invited me over, and then told me to try some “new product” they had. It was ecstasy. I said no, but one of them grabbed my shirt and told me I was going to take it whether I wanted to or not.

I took the pill out of fear, and we went outside to smoke a joint. The ecstasy started kicking in I felt nervous, sick. Under roof with light in a schoolyard, I told them I didn’t feel good. That’s when they pulled out knives. One grabbed my phone and went through my bank app while another threatened me. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my vision blurred, and I thought this is it, I’m going to die.

The next thing I remember, we were in a taxi to an ATM. They took my phone, keys, wallet, bank codes, and all my birthday money. Back at their place, they kept threatening me, showing me a video of them stabbing another guy to intimidate me. On ecstasy and weed, my body overheated badly — I was drenched in sweat, skin burning, close to hyperthermia. I had memory gaps, just flashes of them snorting cocaine, taking benzos, drinking, and trying to force me to start work for them and do fucked up things. After 6–7 hours, they finally let me go. I got my phone back and caught a bus home at 5am with nothing.


The Aftermath

The months after were pure hell.
I had nightly sleep paralysis, nightmares, flashbacks, and constant fear. I isolated myself completely COVID hit and school went online, so my social life disappeared. I started taking my stepmom’s leftover oxy pills to sleep, and keep down my anxiety then quit and went into withdrawal, it was hell. Later I began smoking more, drinking daily, and slipping deeper into depression.

I’ve done EMDR therapy on my own(thanks YouTube)since getting my diagnosis from child psychiatry. Before that, neither of my parents really believed my story. I felt abandoned and didn’t understand why. I’ve been around the wrong people, done stupid things, and it’s left scars.

Now I’m 20, on sick leave for the past 8 weeks, struggling to handle daily stress. I finally saw a doctor who prescribed sertraline, and I’m actually feeling progress.

If you suspect you have PTSD please, seek professional treatment now.
I’ve dealt with a lot of suicidal thoughts. Life has been incredibly hard, and I wouldn’t wish trauma on anyone.

This is just a short version of my story. Feel free to ask questions.
Take care of yourselves. Stay safe. ❤️

1mnk22e,Tips for taking classes with males,"As the title states. 23f. I have bad social anxiety especially around men. In the past with classes at my school it's been comical the difference in my performance depending on whether or not there are too many males in a class and if teachers require groups. I had a Chem class with mainly females and did well and had a blast in the class. But fast forward to a few other classes and I could not handle the guys in the class. If they don't talk to me at all and they aren't the type to weirdly stare I'm generally pretty okay but I've had instances where a guy thought I was being ""bitchy"" when I just simply don't really like getting too close to guys at all. I have past experiences that aren't too bad but for me it makes me really cautious due to not finding the risk to be worth it. I'm taking classes again and am opting for online for the first portion but ultimately I know that I do want to take science classes and they don't have an online option oftentimes due to the labs. I just want any advice on not being paranoid. I am very aware guys aren't evil and I don't think they are. I just have rules where if I'm interacting in a class with a male unless their interests align specifically then I don't see a purpose in them being in my phone since I might have to deal with consequences later on as I do not know them well enough. In high school I had a few times where I had to avoid men due to not liking things that occurred after a phone number was given and it turned out fine since I could just stay away from them but ultimately if I had never given the number I never would have had an issue with them thinking I was ""leading"" anyone on since the number was only given when they stated wanted to be friends or something and I took it literally since I figured if similar classes we could talk about school or something I don't know. But I'm not doing it in college level classes since I don't like the risk. How do I get the heck out of my head. If someone tries to interact and is pushy I struggle to get the worry out of my head until I feel like they won't hurt me or be overly upset which again I feel like is just my paranoia. I can interact with customer service workers fine and I can interact with people who have a specific cause for speaking to me. It's the unprompted casual things that I only prefer with females and honestly don't feel like I should be forced to make male friends really. I had small dumb instances in school last time where I started having to go to the bathroom often to breakdown and panic due to my fears and it made me feel really pathetic. But that was a while back and since I've been fine out in general I think I'll be fine and wanted any tips if possible. ",1754934765.0,0,4,ptsd,ptsd

1mmz3ld,I got PTSD from overdose?,"So when I was 15 I wanted to end my life. (I got a BPD diagnosis just recently) I planned the whole thing. I spent 200 dollar to buy drugs from a dealer. I took 200 xanax(1mg) 150 zopiclone(10mg, sleep pill, the strongest in my country once I took 4 and I started to hallucinate) 100 rivotril(2mg) with 4 Summersby and 0,4l vodka. I drank and I darnk and I took the pills till I passed out. I choked but I didn't stop. I woke up 5 hours later, threw up, couldn't control myself, etc. The doctors said they didn't understand how I survived. So now when I smell ANY medicine I start to throw up, I get in a bad mood, half of my day is ruined and I can't get it out of my head. My hand is always on my mouth.

1mn67te,Buried trauma catching up to me?,"Trigger warning: SA and DV. 

Hi, Reddit. This is a throw away account. I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right place or not. I'm also not sure what I'm looking for. Not sure if I need advice, perspective, reassurance, validation or just for someone to listen who has been through something similar. Maybe it's none of those things, maybe it's all of those things. I won't get into the nitty gritty details of my past, but I'll add that I've been through DV and SA that I went through in a six year relationship. That relationship ended about four years ago if my memory serves correctly. I've been through a few other relationships since then, and then took a year to be single and sort myself out. What I thought was me moving on and healing, was actually just me burying trauma on top of trauma, I think. I've healed in other ways, but I've still a lot of work to do. 

Anyway, I have found an absolutely lovely partner. He's patient, caring, kind, and tries his best to be understanding and talk things through. The other night I opened up to him about my six year relationship, I felt safe to do so. I thought I had gotten to the point where I wasn't fazed by my experiences anymore. Later on that night we went to lay in bed and eventually became intimate. I was okay starting out, and then I started to become flooded with so many emotions brought on from my past, and I asked him to stop, which he immediately did, and I then broke down crying. He was initially confused, but handled me with a lot of care and patience until we went to sleep. In the morning, he made me breakfast, reassured me throughout the day, he really just handled everything perfectly. 

I guess my thing is, why, when I've been so unfazed for so long by my past did it all come flooding back full force? We've had plenty of great sex with emotional connection, and I feel very safe with him. I feel like I'm still getting hit with many emotions that I haven't even felt before and I'm so confused. I feel extremely sorry for my partner because I'm feeling so unstable, but I'm trying my best to hold it together for him. He's reassured me that we're a team and that I'm not alone in this. I'm just very confused and I don't want to stress him out or ruin the relationship and I'm scared about that happening. I'm in therapy, I plan on unpacking everything. I'm just scared that what if I can't overcome this, and that could be why I've buried this for so long. I have no idea. Why now, of all times, is this just now catching up to me four years later? If anyone has questions or needs anything cleared up, I will gladly answer them. My brain is pretty scattered right now and I don't know if I'm just being dramatic and overkill or if I should just move on from the situation that happened with my partner and I the other night. I just can't get everything out of my head. Thanks for reading.

1mnemr1,I want free of my bad habits,"I am a highschool student about to finish my final year, but I keep falling into this... trap over and over again.

5 years ago, I was placed in a homeschooling centre (located in someone's house) since public school hasn't been working for me since I'm Neurodivergent. At first, it went well. We were a small group of 5 with 2 teachers where every Friday was dedicated to just art (I absolutely loved it). My parents were paying allot for this and the woman running the place took quite the liking to me, so I was treated pretty highly but the first red flag started to show during exam season. I was constantly praised for being too smart and I didn't need to do homework or write tests. Being young and naive I believed the woman and spend most of my days just summarizing some work and helping around the house. What did I do during exams you may ask? She gave me the memo and paper and told me to just write everything down the memo said and make a few mistakes to not make it obvious. I was just a fresh awkward teenager and I didn't notice the red flags at first.

The next year the centre got bigger so a few new teachers joined (who weren't qualified at all) . This also brings her daughter in the picture, which I will call N for convenience sake. N was... an interesting character. She often came to teach art on Friday but mostly rotted in her room all day long,She was cruel and will be kind when she felt like it. I somehow managed to get on good terms with her until a new kid joined, I'll call him A, and I befriended him as well. Our friendship was... toxic to say the least. I was very oblivious back then and never knew if someone was just joking or not which he always took advantage of. We got into allot of fights yes but I felt too scared to leave him since he was my only friend. But fast forward, things really started to go downhill as the teachers, including N, started to favor him and treat him as one of them while I was discarded to the side. In a way which I won't go into much detail in, I was discriminated and bullied by the adults I was supposed to look up to. Things really escalated when I went to talk to the head teacher (aka the woman running this place) in her room in private about what I was experiencing. I vented my frustrations and told her I didn't know if I wanted to be friends with A anymore, and when I stood up to go outside to cool off, the moment I opened the door A stood frozen in place as he was previously listening in on the conversation I was having. I yelled at him, he yelled at me, doors slammed, and not only was our friendship broken, but now each and every teacher started to treat him as the victim and myself as the monster.

It's important to note that the head teacher at this time could barely get out her bed from how overweight she was and whatever pathetic illness she had, but she told me I shouldn't worry and she'll take me in and teach me herself. My parents did come to her many times before, demanding awnsers as to why they didn't see any work in my books, but she smoothly lied her way out of it and manipulated them into thinking it was all fine. Ever since then, it sooend most of my time not working at all, but sitting there and listening to that snake vent her entire life story to me on a daily basis and make me doctor her. Ofcorse I was unaware that I was being taken advantage of. She would tell me how special I was to her, hiw my dad was an evil man, how I'm so smart and ask me if I will ever leave her, to which I'd always reply that I'll never leave her side. She used me as an emotional punching bag and milked the money out of my parents while I sat and did nothing, watching 3 years of education rot away while I had nothing to do but draw, play on my phone and be a therapist to an adult. 

One day, I eventually cracked and couldn't take it anymore. I came out to my parents and told them what has been happening behind those closed doors and sure enough, that bitch acted like the mother fucking victim and started to blame me. I was withdrawn from that place without another word as I slowly started to realize how badly effected I was. I've gone to therapy multiple times after I got diagnosed with PTSD when I left, but I still have the same Nightmares of her and that place. My body won't do any task if that task reminds me of my time there. I'm still drowning deep in dark waters yet to be freed from the abuse I've undergone there...

By some miracle, I somehow managed to make it to senior year in highschool online with alright marks and made incredible friends online. But I can't break out the habits I've gained from back then. Sometimes I feel like I'm too smart for my own good and not do my homework. Sometimes I feel so uninterested in class I'll just do something else or go on my phone. Sometimes I don't even study. I've tried everything to break out these habits. Locking my phone away, creating schedules, everything. But nothing works...

I want to be free of these habits and move on, but I don't know what's left for me to do... Even if I don't get awnsers, I just wanted to get all this off my chest.

To the bitch who took everything from me, I hope you rot in Hell.",1754922826.0,1,1,ptsd,ptsd

This guy at work thought it was funny how severly I'd startle if he made a sudden loud noise or appeared close to me without me noticing him approach.

Last week it came to a head. He snuck up to where I was working and slammed his hand as hard as he could against the glass surrounding my cubicle.

Chronic PTSD here. Starting to break out of freeze and man this sucks!!!

A lot of anxiousness and irritability, I don't know maybe anger? Definitely more fighty then flighty at the moment.

Been making progress lately with understanding of people can't meet my needs it's not a reflection on me but more about their capacity. 

I think im craving safe attuned attachment since I've recently experienced it but I can't get enough of it maybe? 

I'm not sure what's going on but I still feel alone and it sucks.

Even if I can somehow regulate myself I have two kids, a toddler and baby so that's just added stress of being there for them and meeting their needs which is probably triggering other stuff because I'm still meeting the needs of others over myself (kids is the one time people should prioritize someone else over themselves).

But that’s the thing…does it ever go away? Can we truly heal from our past traumas? Do we learn to live with it? 

Lately, for some reason, it feels like practically anything triggers (God, how I hate that word is so over fucking used. Oftentimes by people who don’t even have it!) my flashbacks and pain. 

While I will not go into graphic detail about my past, according to the psychiatrist, my trauma apparently stems from childhood, childhood tormentors, betrayal throughout my life and an overbearing, paranoid, abusive mother. Let’s not forget my alcoholic father who, for whatever reason, could never stand up to my mother (always siding with her, wanting to be around her more than what felt like me instead, and so much shit I’ll be typing all year if I try to finish). Bastard felt like a bully at times…God rest his soul. And mom’s. 

I cared for them from 16-25. I find myself telling me: “I could’ve saved them. I could’ve saved us all.” 

Although, they gave me and put me through a lot of unnecessary bullshit…I’d do anything to have them back. Especially, my father. 

They were good people…they had just been through a lot. And made the mistake of taking it out on myself and others. 

I miss them…I miss my dogs…I miss my family. 

I am in therapy (even did some EMDR for a 3 or 4 months) and I do work. I’m very fortunate that both my living and financial situations are stable. 

My memory is not what it used to be. Is that because of the past trauma? I truly do not know. 

Fighters of their trauma…what do I do? 

When I was a child I told that only soldiers could get PTSD. Then when I was in my teens I was told that people who have faced near death experiences could get PTSD whether or not they were in wars/military. 

I want my peace back…I want to say I want to be my old self again or just myself again…but to be honest…I don’t think I ever knew who I truly was and am.

Logically I know it was not my fault, he used force and manipulation.

However I often think I’d enjoy having rough, painful sex, but this time with my consent to somehow gain the power I didn’t have when SA happened. It makes me feel dirty and even more guilty.

Because I didn’t kms or went for help to the authorities and because I can  now have a relationship I feel like the r-word doesn’t  matter.

I don’t know what I’m experiencing. 

I only told strangers on the internet, never told it to a psychologist or friends, I feel like they wouldn’t care because I knew the guy who did this and  still talked to him after he did things to me.

1mn5550,"18M , I came across a disturbing torture/SA video on a hideous telegram channel and now I am permanently traumatised and scared , I wish I had never watched it","I was binge-watching reddit and twitter for some random afghan and Iraq war footages , yk , people of my age group do this a lot . And tbh , I never really got triggered and traumatised by any war footage , legs blown off , beheadings and missile strikes have desensitised me 

Until , there was this random telegram channel link on twitter , idk where I initially saw it , but it was something in Arabic script , with pics of military injuries and etc stuff 

Even upto that point , I wasn't bothered , I clicked the link , it took me to a telegram channel , and as usual there were links on the site 

......the site wasn't about war and stuff , it was filled with videos of SA and extremely torturous stuff being done to minors , old age people , and little puppies 

It was 2 AM , intrusive thoughts got the best of me ,  and I clicked on the first one 

It was from Afghanistan , the dress was afghan , it showed a girl being forcefully dragged from her village compound at night , she was unmistakenly below 18 , the men in the video picked her up in their toyota truck , and than the video cut off to a section where it was dark , but the girl was being brutally hit with the butt of their rifle , the screams were demonic , I was in a fight or flight mode , I didn't knew what I was watching 

And at some period of time in the video , there was a sudden scream "" AHHHGHHH "" ....and later what I deduced out of it , she was getting forcefully SA'ed , she was in EXTREME agony , and cries , it was visible that the girl was being r*ped , and the screams , i can't describe it but pressing the volume button made me regret my decision so bad , I couldn't even go further , i blocked the channel , reported it for child abuse , deleted telegram 

And ....I haven't been able to sleep , that scream and visual is constantly haunting me at night , i feel dehydrated and about to vomit , i know very well , considering the taliban regime in Afghanistan , that girl probably never got rescued or ....might have passed away 

I literally spent hours in the bathroom , locking myself and just ...staring the wall , the screams are haunting me at every second , I tried doomscrolling insta , I tried eating , sleeping 

But ever 15 seconds , the "" AGHHGHH "" comes back and i start shivering 

I can't confess this trauma to my parents or friends , guys I am going mentally insane , please give me any re-assurance tip or mental advice , i want to forget what I watched .",1754892003.0,0,11,ptsd,ptsd
1mmdob0,The shifts that broke me,"This is probably gonna be heavily contested and I should probably expect a surge of hateful DM's the moment this gets posted, but I just can't.
I'm a military cop in the Israeli Defense Force.
A military cop. 
Not a combatant, not anything that'd normally ever see a Palestinian face during the entire service.
However, in states of emergency the military police, on top of our routine missions of maintaining obedience we also have extra action going on - escorting the humanitarian aid trucks as they cross into Israel from Jordan and off to Gaza, and guarding neutralized hostile individuals receiving treatment in civilian hospitals.
The latter takes place in 12 hour shifts, two male soldiers in each - armed to the teeth of course, with the detainee cuffed to the bed to the best of our ability depending on the injuries and allowed to be set free only in order to eat, with a plastic teaspoon only.
Now, while we experienced many so very stupid things with the last such detainee, some things can never be forgotten nor forgiven.
I don't care that I have already been in the shift that shipped him off to prison.
I didn't unlock his cuffs in order for him to intimately touch me.
I didn't agree to help him adjust whatever he needed taken care of - even though I shouldn't by protocol - in order for him to cup anything a feel.
Training preps military cops for many things.
This kind of violation, nothing preps you for.
And the knowledge that the individual responsible has also killed innocents and so did his father before him (it's not a figure of speech, there isn't much to do in a hospital room 12 hours at a time so one spends quite a long time reading the detainee's files and researching them) most certainly doesn't make the pain and disgust any better.
I tried to shove it all in a corner in my mind and power through, but no amount of missions in the world will make the body forget.
The mind won't, either. If it would, tell it to my nightmares.
I guess this is my life now.
The few I shared this with told me to report this to my superiors but.. what good will that make?
He's already in prison, and there is no real way of preventing future detainees from doing the same to others as we can't cuff limbs with bullet wounds and we cannot leave detainees cuffed forever.
Even neutralized hostile individuals gotta eat.

To give background, my dad passed away by his own hand in a gruesome way when I was 13 back in August of 2009. My mom and dad were divorced and my life at my mom's was not good. My dad was my safe place and the only place where I could relax, I didn't have to literally hide so I was out of sight/ out of mind and actually felt love and that I was safe being who I truly was. The emotional and psychological abuse I endured was rough and to lose him destroyed me mentally.

1mm2cz0,"My trauma that had supportive care, was much less traumatic than when I was alienated","Im wondering if anyone can relate.

I have been thinking about why certain traumatic things left me relatively OK, and some just devastated me to my core. Im one of those people with an ace score of 9, a lot has happened.

When I came out, I lost support from my community at my church, who was extremely welcoming beforehand. I felt like a leper, too afraid to be looked at or touched. BUT my lgbt GSA and community center really help me soften that blow. I had lost a lot of friends, basically all of my team from 2 sports I played, and then more people from volunteering, along with the church. It felt much more like I was jumping to a safe haven from a life that felt like a lie.

Same with trauma from my family. I felt much more supported when the school knew about what was happening, and they made provisions because of the situation. I was living out of my car, and I told them that. They allowed me to shower early in the lockers and in addition get subsidized food (or, at least food that was available, I know food programs are stingy/strict, I just know I was being fed)

During this most recent trauma, I was fired as a teacher and I tried to kill myself. I was fired because I said something I didnt mean in a time of crisis, and a parent was offended. I knew that ,when fired, I would immediately lose all of my community from my work, and especially the kids I had trusted relationships with. I knew they would feel something when I left unexpectedly. I felt so shameful. It took me a lot of hospitalization to get stabilized.

When looking back I realized I wasn't supported at all through the school. My previous job before this bad school was better. Thry talked about food insecurity, and always had leftovers for anyone to eat. They had coffee, and allowed me to come in early to prep. They were also really helpful when I had parents threaten me, they backed up my actions with camera footage and they didnt leave the parent unaccountable for their actions. Sometimes those dads who would threaten me wouldn't say sorry, but man their wives did for them! I also got gifts like gift cards that I spent on essentials, and an end of year bonus. I felt happy even though I was exhausted. I left because the owner and I had differences about autism care in the room, as i was being hit daily. That was the major complaint, the violence of the room.

The job that fired me had no extra supports. No coffee machine! When I asked if I could bring my own, I was told no. I would have my monthly meeting with admin canceled and find out it was because the owner overbooked. This happened 5 out of 7 months. I was told I could work on a supplementary project so I could have a full time pay wage, and at the last second it was pulled away from me. I was told conflicting education pedagogy advice, and had no idea what to follow, so I stopped asking and then everyone was mad. I was told I didnt deserve a livable wage, when I brought up the under 40 hours and the under $18/hour pay. I was often alone at the end of the day, and I was criticized on my cleaning, or the extra time it took to clean, where I was cleaning a half of a building to myself. I felt like an outsider a lot of the time, and when I would bring up legitimate issues, I was accused of ""ruining plans"" and ""bringing people down"". I still loved the children, and i only really thought about all the other stuff after the fact, so it was extremely hard to be fired for something that felt like was out of my control. 

I will continue to say that my last center was poorly run and mismanaged. I will probably parrot that forever. After thinking about it after this experience, the trauma in my life generally felt less traumatic when people around me tried to support me and pull me up with anything they could do. I think about my experiences at that bad job differently, and i think about how I would change things for someone like me to make myself feel better.

1mlrge0,I'm surprised that I'm still here,"I've been thinking about my life,  and I'll give a brief  summary. It's going to be long, and really just rambling so bear with me.

My dad molested me from age 4-16 and my mom knew, basically my whole family knew. It only stopped because he left to live with his girlfriend. For months before he let the bank take the house, it was just me and my 15 year old brother trying to fend for ourselves (my mom had moved out of state to live with her new husband.) I was homeless until my mom moved back.

My dad convinced my oldest cousin (I was 6 and he was 13) to fuck me, so it became a regular thing with him too. All of the abuse made me very sexual, and an easy target for men and older boys in the neighborhood. I was used constantly. My dad only wanted anything to do with me when he needed to get off.

My dad was physically abusive too. He would take every bit of anger he had out on me with his belt. I'd have bruises and welts from my back to the back of my legs when he was done with me. He was emotionally abusive too... I remember him telling me that he hates how I had became and he couldn't even pretend to love me anymore.

My mom was and still is manipulative. If I did something wrong she wouldn't speak to me for days, and then she would guilt trip me. She also had an affair with our neighbor, and she was too blind for her love for him to see that he was also molesting me. One day, when I was 8, I walked in on her giving him head, and then walked in on her giving him a hand job a few days later. I told her that I was going to tell dad and she said ""If you tell him he'll be mean to me and it'll be your fault.""

My parents used to scream and fight all night and I'd lay in bed wishing they'd get a divorce. When they finally did, they tried to make me turn on the other. When they both moved on I was homeless for a few months, living in my car and crashing on someone's couch when I could. Both of my step parents didn't like me, so I always felt unwanted.

Now looking back, I'm surprised that I made it to 34. I've had many thoughts and a few attempts, but I'm still here. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",1754751470.0,13,3,ptsd,ptsd

1mlx5vu,Audio track for desensitizing trauma of loud bass?,"I've been struggling with a trauma of loud bass music roughly since 2017. I live in Indonesia, and this crap is cultural. People would blast loud music for hours even through the night, even past 3AM. It's even worse if it's a public event, because not even the police will help you no matter how loud and damaging the noise is. People who hate it don't have the balls to fight it. Best they can do is complain in social media or in private. So I've been fighting this alone with no support for years. I've moved house 4 times, and still find the same problem. Everyone kept telling me ""to get used to it"" because I'll find the same noise wherever I go. I could run to another country like Japan, but I can't leave my mother and little sister. I love them, and they will struggle adapting in another country if I bring them.  
  
I did went to a psychologist, took anti-depressant, built a sound-proofed room, ANC headphones, etc, but nothing worked. Low frequency noise penetrates everything, especially when they're this loud. Exactly a month ago I was at a point where I wanted to commit suicide by killing as many people as I could before getting taken down. Because fuck these people.  
  
But in my desperation, I turned to ChatGPT. I know, I know, but I actually got real progress. I can talk with it longer and faster than I could with a psychologist. It recommended me somatic therapy, and it's been great. I also took a bunch of online tests, and found out I'm a Hyper-Sensitive Person (HSP), so that explains why the sound bothers me more than most people. Two weeks ago, I could actually survive a nightly noise attack without feeling the urge to go outside and find the source. But an hour ago I got another attack, and it was quite bad. It was sudden and I was ill-prepared. I didn't spiral like I used to, but I still got a panic attack, even if I recovered rather quickly. GPT recommended me to listen to an audio track to desensitize myself to bass sound, but it can't look one up for me, so I was wondering it this community has access to such resources.

Please understand that I don't want to look up the exact Indonesian music genre. It's too traumatizing, and I don't want to give them even a search statistic, let alone views. I don't want to ""get used to it"" because that will be like admitting defeat, and acting like this shitty culture is normal. Any tips would also be appreciated. I apologize for my language.

1mls6c0,Am I valid in feeling that this behavior was abusive?,"Hello, I'm not sure what to title this or even what flair to use. I apologize for the length of this.

Cw: childhood abuse, emotional abuse, possibly sexual abuse/harassment.

My father was abusive growing up. He was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. He is narcissistic (not diagnosed NPD, just behavior patterns). When I was a small child, he cooked meth in the basement of my childhood home. He also allowed me (through neglect via leaving it accessible to a very small child) to consume alcohol. This is only to give some background to what type of person he is.

My father always had a habit of playfully patting/smacking my butt. It was a thing for as long as I can remember but in my teens I began to feel uncomfortable by it. When I was 15-16 I told him it made me uncomfortable and asked him to stop. His response was to scoff, then say ""I'm your father, I can do what I want."". That effectively put an end to all conversation in regards to the subject.

Besides the taps on the rear, he also frequently commented on my weight and my body. Not perverse or graphic comments, but really borderline. Like they made me uncomfortable but it wasn't graphic enough so I always questioned if maybe I was the problem. I don't remember many of the comments due to memory loss caused by severe chronic PTSD (also caused by my dad). 

I began covering myself at all times, even when it made me uncomfortable. Pants and long sleeves in the summer, baggy clothes at home, avoiding contact with my father, avoiding eating around him due to comments on my weight (5' 110lbs at the time). This caused me to develop anorexia. I stopped using our home hot tub due to how he'd look at me. Stopped going camping and participating in any other activities with him too. Even felt uncomfortable dressing for things like prom when I knew he'd see me.

Nothing was said out loud or really obviously abuse which is why I've battled with this for so long. It was always little things like wandering gaze, lingering stares, the comments.

1mls4ux,Successfully defended myself against my abuser in a dream!,"I had a gnarly physical flashback last night…my physical ones tend to be freeze mode (like fully in a corner, unable to speak, lose consciousness often). My boyfriend takes me through it and encouraged me to open my body up physically like chest to the sky and I started convulsing but it eventually pulled me out of it. Then we went to sleep…

I had a long dream (as I often do) about my abuser in some new setting but pulling the same old BS on me. This time was different:

Instead of thinking in the dream about how I’d respond to him, I DID SOMETHING! I fought him off physically. Actually landed punches and BJJ chokeholds! AND I told him to his face all of these things I’d normally have held in; I made him small in my dreams.

I’m not a vengeful person, I’m a born empath. Having stood up for myself in such a radical way brought me so much pride, even if it was a dream. I woke up so much more confident in my skin, and was able to pull out of a near flashback this morning too!

1mlvsi0,I was sexually manipulated for 5 years and was to slow to figure it out,"Im sure this will get buried, but growing up, my dad was a very abusive person he was wanted in a few states sold, made meth, used meth and was an alcoholic. My mom wasn't in the picture for a long time, and all my siblings weren't in the picture either. This person named Jen I found online and wouldn't leave them alone because just any kinda love was ok to me. Overtime they manipulated me into believing they had died or fucked with me in a million different ways made other accounts and built them overtime to make me believe I had a group of friends online one was named d I got into a ""online relationship"" with them same with another one named Kate and I trusted jen to the ends of the earth told them everything. They threatened to kill themselves a bunch of times made me think they were gonna just disappear or threatened to harm the other fake people (d and kate) and before I was 18 used me sexually and got pics outta me as a minor. I finally figured it out going searching to prove they were real because i always had a fleeting feeling they werent real (to clarify we had a Spotify account they always used a account from a girl who isnt famous or anything they knew them through a friend and we had played games together a few times it was almost emough proof to say they were real but) I found the person they were using to be jen brought it to them and they told me they were lying the whole time after I pressed them for half a hour and said they did it to keep me alive and ok. To this day, I dont know what to do. I want them to pay for what they've done they used me and used me, and I paid stuff for them like Spotify or doordash. To this day I can't trust anyone growing up it was nothing but trauma ive got a nice diagnosis list and I can't move past it with knowing they're out there living fine while im dying everyday because I can't believe i can be loved unconditionally. The only info i know about them is that they're male, and their name is Jesus M. I have screenshots and a few of their accounts on Instagram Spotify and Twitch.

1mlvnxd,It feels like my parent does not care about what I've experienced and I feel like I'm alone with what I went through. (Very large vent/rant),"CW: Heavy childhood abuse, drugs, neglect, and abandonment.

I just honestly need to vent/rant as I have no one to really talk to that has similar experiences irl. If someone does have a similar experience to me feel free to comment, I just feel very alone in this.

I don't think my dad understands how severe trauma and PTSD actually is.

When I talk about what I went through to my dad just because I need to vent they just switch the convo and talk about their life. He complain that their mom didn't help them with school work and complain that she was annoying all the time. Shes my grandparent now and yes I do agree they were annoying and didnt help much but in the end she does take care of you. Another thing my dad does is that he knows everything that happened but when its mentioned he just goes like: ""yeah thats sad, sorry that happened"" and shows almost no care and just complains about his own life again.

Okay now this is the triggering part, so heads up

This hurts because when I was a kid my mom abused me, abused drugs and accidentally gave me some once, stole my money to buy drugs, gave away my cat behind my back to my grandparents (on my moms side not my dads) then lied that my cat actually died (I found out shes still alive because my aunt saw my cat, I sadly could not get that cat back though), and wanted to keep me in her house at all times.

After everything that has happened my mom went outside as she likes to eat her breakfast outside (idk why tbh). I wanted to ask her a question because a small tablet I had was acting funky but when I walked outside her breakfast was just sitting on my houses doorstep and she was gone. I spent ages calling her name and walked very far away from home to search for her, knocked on random peoples doors to ask for help but sadly they didnt answer me, which I feel dumb for because that was so risky since I was only around 10 years old.

When my mom was found she was sent to court and was now banned from keeping me and I would have to now stay at my dads house for good. Though my mom was furious and wanted to find a way bribe me so she could take me back to her house and she thought of a idea that almost worked.

My mom knew how much I loved cats and that I get heavily attached to any cat I see so she quickly went to buy a ACTUAL KITTEN. When my family members and me all had to meet up somewhere because I had to get some of my stuff returned to me she snuck that kitten in her car. After she gave me my stuff she also put the kitten on my lap and younger me got so attached but when I got all my returned stuff she had to leave so she took the kitten with her and I didnt want it to leave me and I wanted to go with her but my my family members had to stop me. Though after she realized that didnt work she bought ANOTHER Kitten so there was 2 of them but I had to be stopped again. Younger me was heartbroken and I still am today.

I never saw my mom again after that and I'm 19 now (my Birthday was not long ago). I just wish this suffering would stop and I wish she would leave my memory.

I got PTSD from getting groomed. I was 16 years old, having one of my first ever in person classes (I was homeschooled my whole life) in college. I got groomed. In a class that had a span of 3-4 months, twice a week.

I was shaking and having legit panic attacks without even realizing. 

Eventually I spilled all the things I realized to the groomer, pushed her far away. In response, I was slandered, lost friends, made to seem like the bad guy.

She was 21. She's 22 now.

She and I had an encounter on campus one time after it all... She was acting so normal, being like 7-10 feet away from me. I was having a panic attack. She was able to smile at her phone. 

I had gotten physically very sick when trying to break free from the trauma bond that was created.

It's been almost a year since we started having classes together...

I'm 17 now.

It escalated. It's happening online. She recruited about 100 people. They're sharing my posts on Instagram, even the ones that are about my physique (I suspect they're sexualizing me). I'm being monitored. I had to delete accounts. They're trying to regroom me back in for sexual abuse.  

We all know what that's called.

1mloutt,Car Wreck PTSD,"About a month ago I was on my way to work and I was running late. I was on my last strike with my job so I prioritized my job over my safety. I live out in the country so a back dirt road was the quickest route. I was going 60-70 mph and my vehicle lost control and went off the road into a field. My vehicle hit a giant medal post for the fields sprinkler system which caused my vehicle to roll 4-5 times. The minute I went off road I clenched the steering wheel and closed my eyes and I felt the first roll and it was lights out from there. People asked me what I was thinking during but I wasn’t I was feeling and all I felt was a god awful fear that I was going to die. I came to and the vehicle was still and I immediately shut off the engine. I looked down at my body to see if I was injured in any way and everything looked good. I immediately began to cry thanking God that I was still alive. Then I began to panic trying to open the door to get out with no success. All the windows had shattered so basically everything that was in the car flew out during the rolls but thankfully my phone was on the floor board under my feet. I stupidly called my work first and my boss just scoffed and said “I’m sure your car is totalled but you still need to be here you have a lot to do” and I responded like what do you mean I literally just got in a wreck. Later that day a co worker contacted me explaining my co-workers all thought I was bluffing to get out of my shift 😒 Then I called my roommate cause I was still just a mile from home and she came got me out and took me to the hospital. I did receive a citation from the police later for not calling emergency services in retrospect I wish I had cause my roommate didn’t care about me she was more so concerned with getting the vehicle out of the field before the police arrived (I was renting the vehicle from my landlord so the registration/insurance was in his name and my roommate was his girlfriend) so to get the car out so they wouldn’t be pit at fault they also later accused me of wrecking the vehicle on purpose to get out of work which yes we have all thought it but to actually do it? And to that extreme? Ridiculous. Anyways prologue over. I relive the nightmare of that wreck often especially the part where I gripped the steering wheel and closed my eyes and the terrible fear. I haven’t driven sense the accident but when people drive me places it’s terrifying (some are scary drivers like talking on the phone while driving, texting, risky behavior ect…) but I stay quite I don’t want to offend anyone but I don’t know how long I’ll continue to relive it and I have not told anyone about me reliving the experience often so it’s a silent battle. 
So to end this post. Has anyone else here been in a serious accident? Do you still relive the experience or certain aspects of it? Have you found coping mechanisms to help manage?

1ml5znv,Did my dad sexualize me? Is this sexual assault? I feel so tortured.,"EDIT: DIRECT QUESTION::::  that I need validation and honesty on: did my dad have sexual feelings about his daughter (me) 

am I wrong to feel this is sexual assault? Needing validation. 

I’ve recently uncovered some truths and feelings about why I’ve always felt sexualized and very uncomfortable around my dad. I am currently 25, and to this day whenever I would visit my parents, I would feel uneasy and uncomfortable around my dad. The best way to describe it is I felt that he was seeing me naked. Just yesterday in therapy I remembered how he would smack my ass when I was a teenager, and make lots of sexual comments about me. For example he would call me a whore, a prostitute, he would say that all I’m ever going to end up doing is whoring myself out. He would berate me on whether or not I’m having sex or not (this started at 14 years), and I never understood where he was getting these ideas from because I didn’t act or dress promiscuously or anything like that. He would get really graphic with the pregnancy questions saying things like “you’re not gonna get pregnant and ruin our lives are you?” Or “you’re a whore and are going to get yourself pregnant”. He would also comment on my physical looks a lot saying things like I’m a “femme fatale” and that I’m sexy. I remember he one time smacked my ass and my mom made a comment for him to stop, that I’m old enough now. He did the same to my sister. 
He would compare me a lot to his mom (appearance wise) and stare at me and ogle me, which always made me feel super uncomfortable and as if he’s seeing me naked. When I was around 19, I got sexually assaulted. I made the mistake of telling my dad because I was in distress and he looked me dead in the eyes and said “it’s all your fault”. Whatever trust I had in him died then. Over the years I also found porn on his phone, when I was younger. But over the years I could not shake that weird sexualized feeling id feel around him. To this day. He tries to be overly affectionate and this makes me extremely uncomfortable every time. I always felt safe and comfortable with my father in law, but not my own dad. I have cut my dad off as of this point. Am I delusional that this is sexual assault or is this considered sexual assault?

another thing to add is he would ask me constantly whether I’m having sex or not in an uncomfortable way, and would tell me no one wants to be with me for me, but only want to use me for sexual things. 

another thing I remember him doing when I was 16- my parents were watching a movie downstairs, I had gone downstairs from my room to go to the kitchen and as soon as I got down, there was a very graphic sex scene on and someone’s dick was out. When my dad saw that I had come downstairs he immediately started yelling at me, and yelled at my mom saying “she likes it. She likes what she sees.” And then he said to me “you like his dick don’t you?  you want to do that don’t you?” I never understood why he said that to me. I just remember feeling scared and I ran away immediately and just wanted to hide.
Another time I found naked photos of my mom on his computer and he told me that I wanted to see them. They weren’t even buried away. They were just open when I went on his computer to use it for something. I went up to my room after that remember screaming into a pillow. 

It sounds like these are very isolated events that only happened a few times, but he would make comments like this throughout my adolescence up until I moved out with my now husband at 20, when he no longer had control over me living at home. I’m honestly gaslighting myself thinking that I’m over reacting about everything but I just feel like I’m not and just need validation. I feel sick 

I’m a very intuitive person and I feel that I wasn’t feeling these uncomfortable feelings around him for no reason (even after moving out for 5 years). I think maybe now I’m ready to unpack this because I’ve cut off ties with both my parents (narcissistic parents). Anytime I would be around him I would feel as if he is looking at me like I’m naked, and I would never feel comfortable being around him alone. I thought I was losing my mind because I was getting such feelings from my dad, because he’s my dad. It feels so impossible that this could be a real thing you know? In summary: I would feel sexualized and naked and vulnerable around him even when I would just visit them.

Is it actually possible my dad was sexualizing me? I’m a psych nursing student and I feel this is just too close to me to see clearly. I’m very confused and distressed after bringing these memories and feelings to the surface. 

EDIT: I also don’t understand how I was so oblivious of all this and didn’t let myself think of this possibility until literally yesterday. ",1754684570.0,56,42,ptsd,ptsd

1mlknty,so confused,"so one of the things I've never been able to address with any therapist properly is my one little memory of when I must have been about maybe four or five, my brother's room was being renovated and he had to sleep on a mattress on the floor of my sister's and my bedroom, him being eight years older and my sis five years older than me, and that particular morning that I remember hazily, my mom and my sis had already left for some reason, I think, and it was just me and my brother in the room, he must've asked me to join him on his mattress on the floor (that part I don't remember) and he rubbed his penis against my vagina, that's all I remember 
Seeing as how I don't remember a whole lot from my early childhood this obviously stands out but I've never been able to ""categorise it"" properly... the only therapist I mentioned it to, said it was nothing to worry about too much as she'd ""label"" it as ""child's play""...
(for context: _proper_ SA ensued later on in life)

I felt bad/wrong, guilty even, hallmarks of SA, right?
I started masturbating as a young child, probably/possibly as a result of this, Idk? But always felt guilty for that too. Well, I was smacked for it if my mother saw it so yeah, that'd help further the guilty feelings I guess...

And over 4 decades on, I (still) feel like I need to talk about it but don't think I can to anyone...

1mlopm6,Questioning my experience/perception/knowledge after I was stalked and harassed,"[LONG! Half venting, half need support. I don’t really expect anyone to read this given the length. I’m just trying to understand what happened to me] 

Last year I was staked and harassed by an ex work colleague (I’ll call him Dan) who I used to give lifts to/from work, and he got his family involved in it. 

The stalking was so confusing and the harassment so terrifying that it’s left me questioning what happened. 

I know his girlfriend (I’ll call her Molly) is famously abusive in a coercive control way - so much so that a different colleague who used to give him lifts stopped doing so telling me ‘his girlfriend used to make me so uncomfortable’ and commented how she’d linger at the door watching her. His girlfriend was one of the most prominent of my stalkers and I believe she instigated it as this all started after I sent him a message questioning if he was okay following increasingly weird behaviour I was seeing in him - literally the next day she started stalking me and giving me these intense daggers. 

That message literally sparked a campaign of severe harassment from most the minute I sent it which lasted months. My car was vandalised 5 times with scratches in the paintwork. My tyres on both my vehicles were put down thrice in the same manner (it was actually the repair garage who noticed it. They came to me with concern on the third time and said ‘have you annoyed someone recently? This is the third time in 6 weeks your tyres have been put down in the same way, 2x nails in the tyre), I was followed online, in person, and had multiple people take my photograph including one man who stalked me for two hours on foot who took my photo/video with a DSLR camera. 

I reported all of this to the police and got absolutely fucking no where. Such is the scale of corruption within UK police. I know my harasser and his girlfriend have connections in the police (he told me) so I truly believe there was some degree of collusion because I raised 7 reports and not one officer would open an investigation - apparently officers have discretion over whether to open investigations or not and can refuse for any or no reason. I didn’t know this at the time. Hence my believe I was purposely denied investigations as such investigation would prove it was my abuser and his girlfriend. 

I requested CCTV which would have proven it and I never heard back. I submitted photos of the vandalism on my car and never heard back. I was literally ghosted by the police. I put in a complaint last August and it’s STILL waiting to be allocated to a case handler despite twice chasing it via my MP. They won’t even give me a rough timescale for when I can expect a reply so I’m living in anticipation daily. They haven’t even LOOKED at my complaint. Even still, I’ve already been told it’ll get no where because when I received an acknowledgment of my complaint last year the officer told me ‘we can’t reopen investigations’. I told her no such investigation was ever opened to begin with but she didn’t care and just reiterated. So essentially they’ll say they’ve investigated themselves and found they did nothing wrong because they have ultimate discretion to open a case or not. They chose not therefore they’ve absolved themselves of any responsibility before they’ve even looked at my complaint. 

In essence, the police either through incompetence or collusion or both let me down massively and now I’m left terrified every single day all whilst questioning my self, what I experienced, feeling crazy, overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and self blame. 

I tried suicide 8 weeks ago after coming down from psychosis which was caused by the trauma. My delusions and harsssment have now left me terrified to even die because I’m convinced I deserve this suffering, that’s it’s my fault, and that if I kill mysekf I’m trapping myself in samsara because I couldn’t learn whatever lesson I’m here to learn. 

I’m terrified every single day of it starting again, of going into psychosis again. I wake up every day terrified and feeling this empty pit and void like I’m completely and utterly undeserving of love. I’ve been abused all my life and this has just underscored all my biggest, deep seated wounds and fears and I honestly don’t know how to overcome them. 

What’s worse is because I had psychosis even the fucking psychiatrist doesn’t fully believe me - he asked me ‘and how much of this harassment do you believe to be true?’ 

I WAS STALKED AND HARASSED. It’s notoriously hard to prove. That’s why people do it. To make their victims feel crazy, look crazy, and in my case go crazy trying to prove it. 

I’m just terrified. I feel like I’m being punished. It’s the only explanation I have. I just want to go home and I’m still angry at god that I survived my suicide attempt 8 weeks ago but now I’m too scared to try again in case I’m dooming myself to samsara/hell. It doesn’t help I found Christ during psychosis and Christianity is unclear what happens if you suicide. Some say hell others say god has compassion. 

I want to believe god does have compassion but I’m struggling so hard to understand my harassment and it’s making me question existence as I know it. ",1754743991.0,1,1,ptsd,ptsd
1mlokze,4 years on I'm still struggling with the past - Leading to more issues - Time for meds?,"I'm a chronic overthinker who gets lost in mental loops. When explaining anything, I spiral back in time to cover every connection, constantly reliving everything. This mental state has caused car accidents and speeding tickets - I'm terrified of messing up but keep making mistakes anyway.

The fear makes me freeze on important tasks like opening these letters, which creates more problems. I'm over 12 points on my license and fear job loss. Sometimes ending it all feels easier.

I wake up panicked and stay hypervigilant, constantly scanning others for emotional cues that might trigger more panic - keeping me in a permanent state of anxiety.

Physical symptoms: I don't eat until I need energy for work, vape constantly (gums receding), and my hair's been falling out for two years.

I'm compassionate with others but brutal to myself. I need to explain everything in exhaustive detail - even my recent therapy session last week was 45 minutes of non-stop talking without getting everything out.

I think this stems from stopping my medication 3 years ago and trying to cope alone, possibly related to ADHD + Autism. I have spent a lot of time researching trying to understand how or why the relationship went the way it did so i don't repeat the same mistakes but it also causes me to relive more trauma.

A therapist before just labeled her as a narcissist who took advantage but i don't think its that simple, and if i was so unaware. how can i trust someone else?

I have tried dating after these events, but I'm either comparing to the perfect version i thought she was or seeing reflags.

# Early Life and Family Background

**Childhood Trauma - Suppressed/Unknown Until After Ex-Fiancée Split:**

* Parents divorced when I was 6 years old
* Dad was self-employed and went bankrupt
* Mum took my brother and me to choir; I stayed until age 15 and sang at hundreds of weddings cementing values
* Walked in on mum giving oral sex to a married neighbor (also discovered affairs with her friends' husbands who were doctors, etc.)
* Mum abandoned my brother and me due to financial worries when I was around 9
* The next day, step-mum said ""I suppose you will have to live with us."" Dad didn't say anything
* When mum asked us to come back, my younger brother returned but I stayed at dad's - not feeling welcome, feeling like a burden, but didn't trust my mum. Younger bro ended up being kicked out again.  he went to stay with our step bro. 

**Upbringing and Perfectionism:**

Dad is stoic , incredibly perfectionistic and not troubled with self doubt. 
When he realized I was academically smart, he set goals for me to be ""first or last."" I tried to achieve these in an attempt to earn the love and support that only mothers typically show.

I applied this perfectionism to everything - I needed to be perfect to meet someone who could be my forever person.

While I saw my mum occasionally, I didn't reach out. e.g  When my disabled step-brother reached out to tell her about a possible cure for his condition, she talked about herself instead.

**Personality Influences:**

* Mum: ex-model hairdresser, always very emotional
* Dad: always solution-focused/robotic engineer type
* Potentially ADHD vs. Autistic traits

# How This Affected My Relationships

**First Serious Relationship (University):**

My first proper girlfriend was at university - she added me on Facebook and pursued me. 
I had a serious accident in summer holidays where I couldn’t walk for a year, big toe was paralysed for  months. I stayed with my disabled bro smoking weed like he did until I could move back to my flat. 

4 years into the relationship , I thought I was supposed to propose. I started to have many doubts about her being my ""forever person."" We never had fights or arguments; it was stable and okay. But I hadn’t really dated before. 

One night out at university, I Eskimo kissed another girl. The next day I was riddled with guilt to the point that I gave my girlfriend three months' rent and moved out.

She would have forgiven me, but I felt so guilty not knowing earlier she wasn't the one. 
i made a rule to be the perfection version of myself and find someone i could fully commit to and build a family of my own. 

**Consequences:**

* Ended up smoking weed and playing PC games constantly
* Procrastinated on tasks until the last minute
* Was set to get a first-class degree but ended up capped at 2:2, having to retake a module
* Couldn't handle this failure; couldn't face my dad
* The shame and guilt consumed me

**Financial Cushion and Avoidance:**

I had £75,000 from a workplace accident settlement (paid out before I broke up with my first girlfriend). This money allowed me to hide from my problems.

I got laser eye surgery and a hair transplant. One eye had complications, and I smoked weed non-stop, played games, and distracted myself, making the eye condition worse. I focused on the eye issue instead of dealing with my 2:2 degree.

Eventually I ran out of money and nearly killed myself. I finally had to reach out to my dad. He told me never to take ""happy pills"" and gave me practical advice but never talked about feelings.

**Career and Dating Struggles:**

I became a bar manager but felt insecure because it wasn't suitable for meeting my ""forever person."" I didn't date at all until an accidental friends-with-benefits situation where I said I was going home and she offered to come too, she fell in love with me. I felt guilty because she wasn't my type, but maybe it was my fault for cooking for her and cuddling? Again I had hurt somone even thou unintentionally. 

I didn't date again until I was offered my own pub as landlord. That same day, I pursued the girl I had been pining over for ages, but I wasn't in a position to be a person of value, worthy of her love.

# Ex-Fiancée Relationship

**Her Background:**

* Had a house and good job
* Had the best family unit I've ever experienced, she always pushed them away for one reason or another. (I was the one that wanted us to go over and visit alot of the time)
* Had trauma from exes and never knowing her real father
* One ex cheated on her
* Another took advantage of her earning less
* Another sent threatening texts from a dummy phone causing fear and anxiety (he met ""the stalker"" and got cut with a knife - really he cut himself)
* Had a history of rape

All of this made me believe she was perfect and innocent, while I was nothing like that. I understood how this would cause hypervigilant and me earning less was a trigger.

**Early Relationship Dynamics:**

I fell for her incredibly fast - nothing mattered more to me than her. One month in, she tried to break up with me after a night out, saying she was trying to protect me from the stalker (I didn't know it was an ex then).

I broke down, punched windows, and cut myself. She chased after me to hold me, but I couldn't handle it - I ran from her and pushed her away. (Childhood trauma was activated then.) I attributed this to me not earning as much as her.

She opened up about an STD she should have disclosed earlier. Months later, she asked me to move in - I remember asking if she was sure.

**Work-Life Balance Issues:**

Being a bar manager, I missed weekends and family events. She would get upset and lash out, push me away, and tell me how she needed me to be around. The stalker issue compounded this for her.

She told me to ""just wear a fucking eye patch and go into architecture."" She pushed me away and talked about breaking up. I always put myself down and told myself this was due to her past traumas and my job.

One day she sat me down and said that if I took the landlord job, it would be terrible for our future kids. Instead of seeing this as manipulation, I saw someone who thought about children the way I do. I doubled down and told my boss I couldn't accept the position even though it ment everything to me at the time.

Trying to find a job that didn't involve looking at screens yet stimulated me seemed impossible. I became really depressed and tried to hide it, but our sex life suffered. She asked me about swinging - I started throwing up and feeling awful, but blamed it all on myself or her past traumas. I was too busy idolizing her and beating myself up.

# Solved the Problems

**Business Success:**

During lockdown, after renovating her house, I built a shed in the garden and made a home bar out of whiskey barrels. (I always loved figuring out how things work, making and fixing things like my dad.)

I started an Etsy business that did amazingly well. I kept the pub job for security until I was certain I could go full-time. I worked incredibly hard - would forget to eat, research all night for new things to make. I was trying so hard to solve my insecurities about earning less and her resentment so our relationship could finally start properly. 

At Christmas, I made £8,000 in sales in one month. I was on cloud nine, addicted to the ping of each sale. I felt like I was showing so much love - every item I made was a step toward building a family.

I had taken on a massive, life-altering challenge and finally achieved it. I thought about how she would love me so much and we would live happily ever after.

# Manipulation and Downfall

**Role Reversal:**

Instead she asked if she could work part-time and study. I resented this i NEEDED us to start living a normal life where i could plan events and pay for things,  but i kept quiet and said I would love to do that one day.

I was already working way too much - not living life, skipping meals and sleep. Something i tend to do anyway when I'm really into it ADHD?

**Trickled over time:** 

She told me how she hated her job after moving locations, how she was stuck there before i wasn't earning enough, then said the doctor signed her off work. How she thought about hurting herself. 

Then in front of all her family (whom I saw as my own), she said she was fired from her job and apologized to me for the first time. In that split second, I processed everything and told her she could study and work part-time.

**The Commitment and Fear:**

I felt a massive knot in my stomach because I knew sales were largely due to lockdown. I knew I needed to build a website and other sales avenues. But I also knew I was fully committed to the person I thought about having kids with.

The guilt I had held for so long feeling like a burdon causing her to push me away - I had made plans to propose now that I had ""solved"" our problems. If she couldn't work, I needed to make up for it. I couldn't go back on what I had agreed to in that moment, or I would be a fraud - like her exes who had caused her to resent me for earning less.

**My Fatal Rule:**

I MADE A RULE: NEVER TO MAKE HER FEEL THE GUILT I FELT.

She was open about depression after losing her job. I couldn't risk pushing her over the edge (applying my own thought patterns to her).

Sales dropped, but I kept quiet, expecting her to know just by being logged into the app. And even if I was loaded, she should still want to work and contribute too.
I always tried to remain positive, pointing out good sales rather than the lack of consistent ones. I forced myself not to complain about her not even working two days a week - all because of this well-meaning but stupid rule.

# The Cost

**Growing Resentment:**

I constantly thought about her not even working two days a week. Resentment grew, but I kept thinking she must be too sick to work - why else wouldn't she be helping?

I couldn't bring myself to spend any money for fear of not having enough to pay bills she was hiding from me. I never bought her a proper engagement ring for this reason.

When she complained about small things - like me not cooking nice meals, not cleaning the house, not emptying the bin in the room where she studied - it angered me. I thought these were inconsequential compared to our financial worries that I never talked about.

The whole time, I thought she needed to prove to me she could work. I was waiting for her to get a part-time job and step up without me having to say it, while also thinking I needed to work harder and earn more to solve and fix all problems.

# Serious Issues and My Reactions

**Mental State:**

Permanently in a cortisol-fueled, ADHD hyper-focused state. When she lashed out or did bad things, I couldn't handle it. I felt like I was doing all I could, and I would react in the moment by breaking things. In my mind back then, she would play the victim and point the finger, accusing me of terrible things. And I resented it focusing on how hard I was working. 

**Triggering Events:**


* I couldn’t eat or sleep with out weed
* when we did have sex, I would get dizzy and struggled
* Wanted me to buy a car for her while she wasn't even working 2 days a week
* Told me she was ""bumping and grinding"" with someone, not answering questions until I broke something, then used that to play victim and kick me out
* Asked me about doing OnlyFans - this made me save money for a different reason. Incase we split up
* Would never apologize or take accountability for actions that led to my reactions. But admittedly I was keeping quiet about the main problem. 

My breaking things and talking way too fast was never okay. I always felt such guilt that it was my main motivator to give up everything trying to solve our problems. But I hated how she would never allow me to explain.

# Terrible Actions

**The Knife Incident:**

I stayed on the sofa for two days trying to get an apology for something, my mind going 1000mph - it felt like weeks. I was chain-smoking weed. She came down because she needed to eat and offered to make something. I said all I wanted was an apology.

With a knife already in her hand for food prep, she shouted at the top of her voice. At that point, I had vivid hallucinations of her throwing the knife at my damaged eye. She was the type to hit and punish people for hurting her. But I filled in the blanks and felt cornered in the room with no exit.

I grabbed another knife and pointed it at her for a second while I disarmed her. I immediately threw both knives in the sink and ran out of there.

**Aftermath and Self-Punishment:**

This was so terrible on my part. I hate it to this day. She is, of course, traumatized by it and felt like I threatened her. But this wasn't my intention - I really wanted to remove the threats. We were both smoking weed, not communicating, and paranoid.

I went to my brother's house and punished myself, physically hurting myself for causing her to feel so scared. I took all responsibility and begged her to take me back.

# Ending

**Final Incidents:**

She called the police on her sister we were looking after. The morning after, she hit me in my sleep and told me it was my fault, accusing me of cuddling and not letting go.

I tried all day to get an apology - the first time in our relationship I couldn't blame myself for what happened. The fact that she was blaming it on me turned all those paranoid, anxious thoughts I'd had into facts.

**Seeking Guidance:**

After work, I made plans to talk to my dad, who told me this was exactly the kind of thing my mum used to do. He said if she couldn't apologize for this, she wasn't the kind of person I'd want to have kids with anyway. I kept telling him about things I did wrong and my worries that she wouldn't apologize. He reassured me she would.

**The Final Boundary:**

Weeks went by - my mind racing, it felt like months. I really wanted to forgive her and talk about finances. Instead of asking for an apology directly, I started bringing up things I was annoyed about, hoping for any kind of remorse or apology. I couldn't be the one to chase her anymore. I made this my boundary to stand on until I was met with any kind of apology.

I never received it.

**Revelations:**

I reached out to her ex who had cheated on her - turns out she had thrown a knife at him before.

A few weeks later, my mum got cancer. I reached out to her mum and step-dad, worried they would be angry and hurt me for my reactions. Instead, they gave me a hug and let me talk about things that were going on. They told me how she went to Bristol with a bunch of guys and was dating one of them.

Mum died a couple of months later.

**Final Conversation:**

My ex finally had a long phone call with me. She told me she thought I had broken up with her and that all the hundreds of messages she never replied to were just to make her feel bad. (I never corrected her until a year later, as it would make her feel guilty about sleeping with someone else.)

She asked if me pleading for forgiveness and saying goodbye was just a tactic to manipulate her into worrying I'd kill myself. I told her how my brother had to stop me from hurting myself, and that I stopped replying because I didn't want her to message me only out of guilt. She made a joke about it.

I finally asked about the swinging comment. She told me she thought we were going to be together forever and that I wanted to do it. (The biggest thing that affected me, and she put that on me too.) I had split from my first girlfriend over just an Eskimo kiss - monogamy is everything to me so kids can have a stable home.

# Reflection

I was in shock. We never had proper closure. Four years later, I still bounce between feeling guilty (which cancels out her guilt) and feeling tricked and manipulated the whole time.

Ultimately, I gave up my sense of self trying to fix things and became codependent. That intense love I felt was caused by believing all the good things about her and envisioning a family together.

My ability to push myself to work so hard and suppress my needs was empowered by my daydreaming about our family and future.

Ultimately, I still look back at how my ultimate act of love - not bringing up her not working - was the thing that hurt us both so much, causing so much anxiety.

And does any of it matter if our whole future was based on a lie?

Still yo-yoing between these feelings.

Even if we were completely wrong for each other, even if she  ""Never loved me"" i would have wanted closure before she did something i couldn't forgive.

When her bro called and asked if we could see a therapist i regret believing she broke up with me,

i put a lot of it down to our own unresolved issues before meeting each other.

And think how horrible it must have been for her , stuck with a depressed anxious workaholic who didn't outwardly show love like he did at the start.

There were a 100 moments i should have called her out on not working, but i stuck to a stupid rule i thought was my ultimate act of love and sacrifice.",1754743592.0,1,2,ptsd,ptsd
1mlf159,Does anyone else’s arm or body keep flailing around all the time?,"I have PTSD mostly from growing up in a verbally abusive/religious household.
One day in therapy, I realized some pretty distressing/messed up things about my childhood. I cried and my arms came up over my head over and over again. 

Since then, I noticed my hand would move involuntarily if I was triggered or stressed. 
Then my whole arm started moving. 

Now, in public and at home, my arm flies up at random times. Sometimes I can’t hold things cause they might fall out of my hand. 

In public, I keep having to pretend like I need to scratch my head. But it’s repetitive and my arms keeps coming up and sometimes hits my face and jaw by accident. 

I also notice I keep having this urge sometimes to throw things, bash my head into a wall, or hit myself. I have never been a violent person ever. My arm does ocassionally smack myself in the leg repeatedly. But, I have no idea what’s happening. 

I can’t find other posts of people also going through this. It sucks. I hate it. My body doesn’t feel like it belongs to me anymore and it’s only been 2 weeks. 

What the hell do I do?

I wouldn't call it a flashback because it's not like I see/feel like in the moment of my trauma, but whenever I'm exposed to fireworks (my worst trigger) I immediately start crying and go into fight or flight. Like I just start running to some place my body feels safe. I swear to god I can't control it, it's like my body goes into autopilot and just does whatever it wants. What is this thing called???",1754722008.0,2,2,ptsd,ptsd

1ml4h50,Dissociating in therapy,"I sometimes dissociate in therapy, it’s not a huge deal. I start staring into space, sometimes my vision slowly fades and I need a couple of moments/noises/words from my t to fully bring me back. I know I’m lucky that that’s even possible and that I don’t dissociate heavily. But every time my t guides me through those dissociations, some weird part of me feels comforted, seen, validated. I was just wondering whether that’s a feeling other people are familiar with? When they ask me to name things I see, get up, focus on them, breathe etc., it’s of course shitty cause dissociation sucks, but it also has quite an effect on me. I sometimes fantasize about those moments happening, and I guess it probably just is about feeling seen, but do you guys have that weird… satisfaction or whatever it is too? Do you daydream about stuff like that too? Would love to hear your experiences.",1754680988.0,16,16,ptsd,ptsd
1mku0g0,I told my dad about my PTSD and he made it about himself.,"Hi, I’m reaching out because I’m feeling a little lost and could really use some advice or gentle guidance.
Recently, I shared something deeply personal with my father — I told him about my experience with sexual assault and how it’s impacted me. I’ve been working through a lot of difficult emotions and trying to understand what healing looks like for me. One thing I’ve learned is that I need to feel safe in my body again, and part of that has meant setting small boundaries around physical touch — even with people I care about.

After I told him, I asked him, as kindly as I could, not to hug me. I just wasn’t ready. But he hugged me anyway — firmly, without asking — and I didn’t feel like I had a choice in that moment. It left me feeling shaken. Then, the next day, when I gently tried to explain again why I needed space, he got upset. He raised his voice and told me that what I was asking for was “bullshit,” and that he “can do whatever he wants to me.”

Since then, I’ve been carrying a lot of confusion, fear, and sadness. I want to believe he cares, but it’s been hard not to feel like my pain was minimized — or that his need to feel in control was more important than my need to feel safe. It’s been especially painful because it feels like he’s made my trauma about him — about his reactions, his emotions, and how he feels about the boundaries I’m trying to set. I know people process things differently, but I can’t shake this sense that I’m not being truly seen or heard.

I don’t know how to move forward from here, or how to protect my peace while still trying to keep some kind of relationship. I feel very small around him right now, and I’m questioning how much space I’m allowed to take up in my own healing.

If anyone has been through something like this — or even if you haven’t — I’d be really grateful for any thoughts, advice, or even just reassurance. I’m just trying to take gentle steps forward, and this has made things feel a lot heavier than I expected.

Thank you so much for reading.

EDIT: I also wanted to add — I didn’t actually tell him about my experience willingly. He noticed I was acting “weird” about being touched and kept pressing me until I eventually told him. It wasn’t something I chose to share on my own terms, and that’s been sitting heavily with me too. I think that’s part of why his reaction has been especially hard to process — it already felt like something was taken from me, and now I feel like I’ve lost even more control over how I navigate my own healing.",1754656556.0,44,32,ptsd,ptsd
1mkqmxu,PTSD Smell of dead body,"I lost my brother to suicide in 2024. He stepped in front of traffic, we got his body back on the Sunday and we began a wake process where the coffin is open (he didn’t look to bad from the chest up). People started to notice a bad smell coming from the coffin. My parents tried to cover it up with sprays but I didn’t know what smell they were talking about thankfully as I had been speaking to lots of people and not spending too much time near the coffin. Then suddenly on Tuesday when I was standing beside him, I caught a horrible stench that has not left me since. It was gut wrenching and I’ll never forget it. 

What has surprised me is that every so often I will smell something very similar. I assume it is generally bad unhygienic bodily smells, faeces, something like that. But it really catches me off guard. I never thought I’d have to smell it again. Has anyone had a similar experience? ",1754645381.0,57,29,ptsd,ptsd
1ml7co2,I’m so sick of nightmares,"At least 10 nightmares over the past couple years, all about sexual assault, all featuring my father and his wife (both of whom I haven’t seen in years). I don’t know what they mean. I don’t know why I have them. 

I narrowly dodged being sexually assaulted several times as a kid. I’ve been harassed a few times too. However, I’ve never been actually touched or assaulted, I’ve just been made to feel threatened. These nightmares are way more intense than harassment. They are violent and scary and I wake up with this heaviness in my mind that clouds my brain for a few days.

That is to say, I had another dream last night and it’s sent me spiraling. I’m so sick of my dreams returning back to being assaulted and abused. I’ve never had these experiences (that I know of) but they’re so vivid.

1ml43vc,Dissociation is taking over my therapy sessions,"Hi, i have complex PTSD. And my dissociation has started to affect my therapy sessions to the point where( i think) ten minutes into the session I start to dissociate and we don’t go very deep. It more of hello how are you thing and then we can be talking about college or something very light and then i dissociate until the end of the session. 
I actually know when this started and what you just read is what just started recently. So back in October my therapist want to see how I would react in a different in environment( I do therapy viural) so on October 15 I did it at school( I did a program for disabled adults) and I told my therapist I want to deep trauma work, well i started to dissociate but could still function and made through the session. But afterwards I dissociated for 2 hours( 10-12 somewhere in that time line) and my teacher I think came in about 20 minutes in and started helping me but I was so dissociated nothing worked. After that session i would dissociated like every other session for about 3 minutes and then be fine as the weeks went on it started turning into every session i would dissociated for around 5-10 minutes. I would say In the past month where it has turned in the the whole session. It’s very scary. It’s gotten to the point where I have panic attacks before sessions because I am scared of dissociating( I have sent an email to my therapist telling her this because I literally can’t in session. I have a team of mental health professionals and my service facilitor has suggested put a pause on therapy because I’m literally not getting anything out from it. I agree to a certain extent. I was thinking about it and I’m not going to do it because my therapist cancels on me a lot so I kind of get a break. At this point I don’t know what to do. I don’t get much sleep because I have flashbacks, and crying every night for my teacher, like a child who misses their mom. I’m so scared for my next therapy session.

1ml11k0,Just a little vent,"I didn't realise the most difficult thing about ""healing"" or moving on - isn't reaching that point. But rather what happens after 

It's crazy right? I'm catching up on all the sleep I missed, but sometimes I get these phantom hunger pains - I know I'm not hungry, but there were days I could go without eating. Or maybe you feel extra jumpy right? Your body is finally exiting survival mode, so anything spooks you.

But you know what I really find difficult, is adjusting to reality. You know? One moment it's the incident the next it's 2025. I don't think you ever ready for the sudden snap into reality. I mean like it's weird right - we sometimes so deep into dissociation, that we kind of just living our lives on autopilot? So in those moments I was just interacting with people like a robot.  But now, it's so hard to engage or socialise with people. 

I dread when someone talks to me, I literally go blank, I kid you not. I don't know what to say, it's like I have nothing to say. It's because you given control of your mind, but at the cost of - you are on your own from that point forward.

Even sending a text message seems so daunting. Maybe it's because your old reality no longer exists. But jeez, I don't know. I sometimes feel tears swelling up in my eyes after conversations, because engaging with people makes you realise how far out of reality you have been.

Anyways, I just needed to get this off my chest. Like my therapist says, we human right, it's important to feel our emotions.

1mkw9vr,I’m tired of the homelessness nightmares,"So throughout high school and part of middle school my mom and I were homeless off and on. We lived with family for most of it so I never experienced any like street sleeping. My mom did though. We’ve been housed for four years now

But I keep having random nightmares about being homeless every now and then. 

Specifically, I keep having nightmares where we live in my childhood home. But we aren’t allowed to live there. For some reason the place is empty but owned by someone who’s been trying to sell it, and we’ve snuck into it to live until we find our own place. Often the nightmares are set during the winter, and the focus is usually on keeping the owner out (locking doors- for some reason they don’t have a key?) or hiding that anyone lives there (hiding in the attic and being quiet or making sure not to have too many lights on). I’ve also had one where the house was starting to decay

It’s frustrating to say the least. My nightmares have decreased exponentially since being on quetiapine, but when one does sneak through, it being about homelessness isn’t great. It makes me worry if these will ever stop fully. Will my subconscious always fear being without a home?? No matter how stable my situation is?? 

I don’t even really talk about homelessness in therapy. I’m not even sure how I would. Like that time isn’t very present in my mind. I don’t think about it much. Especially now that I have a home. I don’t presently fear becoming homeless again, but I guess a part of me does. Idk",1754662251.0,3,5,ptsd,ptsd
1mkzoh2,PTSD and Relationships and  Libido,"CONTENT WARNING: Mention (no specific descriptions) of CSA and sexual trauma 

I have a pretty complicated case of PTSD that results from a variety of incidents (ranging from being raised in an abusive home, the troubled teen industry, partially witnessing the SA of someone else, CSA incidents while traveling, being raised by a narcissist, etc). I have been in therapy for about 5 years (currently 20 yrs old) and some of this therapy has involved working on my trauma but most of it is usually focused on managing my response to whatever current situation I am in (not actually addressing the root trauma). 

I have almost always had issues with Libido (flips between slightly higher than normal and almost nonexistent). I am currently looking for (hopefully) reassurance that this sort of dysfunction/issue can be treated and I am seeking recommendations on how to treat it (ex: types of therapy, mental framework, tips on compartmentalization, etc). 
The reason why I care abt this right now is because I have been in a long term relationship that is long distance during the school year (for college) and, this summer, I have had essentially nonexistent libido for about 44/45 days I have been home. My boyfriend is super sweet and understanding, but I can tell he is getting confused and he is worried I am not attracted to him anymore. I feel like I am definitely still attracted to him, but when he mentions it I do get worried that maybe I am subconsciously not attracted to him anymore and that is why my libido is so low. 

Here are some factors that impact the situation: 

I am on 40mg Prozac. I have been on it for years and it definitely lowers my libido significantly, but I have had high libido on this medication as well. 

I have ARFID, a restrictive ED, that is primarily based in my trauma. When I am malnourished for prolonged periods of time I lose my Libido completely.

As a result of my trauma, I have tactile hallucinations of people touching me inappropriately without my consent and sometimes it goes further too. This means that anytime I am touched unexpectedly I can sometimes fall into this state of tactile hallucinations. 

Summertime is the time frame when I experienced two major incidents that lead to my PTSD. 

I haven’t been working with a therapist for about 5 weeks but I am starting with a new therapist within the next week. She has experience in EMDR and I haven’t tried that yet (I have done CBT, DBT, ACT, ERP, and some others) so I am wondering if I should ask her if we could focus on trying EMDR methods … BUT I go back to school (and back to another therapist) in about 6 weeks. 

Some of my trauma comes from my childhood experiences and I am currently back in my childhood home (with my parents) for the summer and I think this is heightening my anxiety and trauma responses. 

I haven’t been thinking about / dreaming about / imagining anything sexual during this time period of very low libido. This makes me think that it isn’t about my boyfriend at all and it is something going on in my brain/body. 

Theoretically … I also smoke weed daily, usually I hit my pen after work. In the past weed has significantly increased my libido sometimes but recently it hasn’t done anything for my libido really. 

I also need help on how to explain this situation to my boyfriend. I have talked with him about it before, but I never feel super comfortable talking about it because I am not sure if it will be able to change. 

Please let me know what advice you have, I need help. Thank you! ",1754670072.0,2,4,ptsd,ptsd
1mkzl9l,What is PTSD?  How is it resolved?,"I am a hypnotherapist and my PTSD clients ask these two questions...A Lot!!!

A lot of people ask these questions in this subreddit too so I thought I'd do my best to answer them.  I'm not gonna patronise you, I'm gonna give you the full scientific explanation.  I don't expect you all to have biology degrees but it's good to get a grasp of how your brain works.  If there's anything you don't understand either look it up or ask me.  Thers's no such thing as a stupid question, ask.  Understanding your own sh!t might at least help you cope with it better. Right?  Sometimes that's all you need, instead of constantly asking yourself, ""what's wromg with me?""

Right, pull up a chair, here we go, the science sh!t...

The Amygdala: The Alarm System

The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped structure located deep within the limbic system of the brain (actually there are two of them but they perform the same function so it's easier just to refer to them as a single thing). It plays a central role in the processing of emotions, particularly fear, threat detection, and the initiation of survival responses. During a traumatic event, the amygdala becomes highly activated, rapidly assessing danger and triggering the body’s fight, flight, or freeze response. In individuals with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), this heightened state of alertness may persist long after the actual threat has passed. This is due to the amygdala’s tendency to encode the emotional salience of the event—essentially, how threatening or distressing it felt—rather than its factual details.

Although it does not store explicit or narrative memory, the amygdala can be thought of as holding onto the emotional “charge” of the trauma. This is why a person may experience a strong emotional or physiological reaction (such as panic or dissociation) in response to a trigger, even if they cannot consciously recall the traumatic memory. These responses occur automatically and without the involvement of higher-order reasoning.

The Hippocampus: The Contextual Integrator

The hippocampus, another key structure within the limbic system, is primarily responsible for encoding and organizing episodic and contextual memories—that is, the “what, where, and when” of an experience. It acts as a sort of filing system, helping the brain understand that a traumatic event is over and belongs to the past. However, during trauma, the hippocampus can become disrupted or suppressed due to the overwhelming stress response. As a result, it fails to fully process the event in a coherent, linear way.

This impairment contributes to many of the classic symptoms of PTSD, such as fragmented memories, time distortion, and flashbacks in which the person feels as though the trauma is happening again in the present. During recovery—whether through psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, or other trauma-focused modalities—the hippocampus is re-engaged. It begins to reorganize the traumatic memory, placing it into a narrative context and allowing the brain to recognize that the danger has passed.

The Cerebral Cortex: Archiving and Meaning-Making

The cerebral cortex, particularly the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is responsible for executive functions such as reasoning, impulse control, self-reflection, and emotional regulation. In a trauma response, the prefrontal cortex often becomes downregulated, which means its ability to evaluate the situation and apply logic is diminished. This allows the amygdala to take over, leading to emotionally driven responses.

As trauma is gradually processed and the emotional charge is reduced, the prefrontal cortex resumes its regulatory function. It helps the individual to reinterpret the meaning of the traumatic experience, integrate it into their life narrative, and store it as a long-term memory within the broader structure of the neocortex. In this way, the traumatic memory becomes less vivid, less emotionally triggering, and more a part of the past than the present.

Integration: From Emotional Reactivity to Narrative Coherence

In summary, trauma initially disrupts the brain's normal processing system: the amygdala becomes hyperactive, the hippocampus loses contextual control, and the cerebral cortex goes offline. Through therapeutic interventions, this balance can be restored. The trauma is revisited in a safe, supported manner.  In hypnotherapy the event is often revisited at a deeply subconscious level without the client being consciously aware of it. the hippocampus reprocesses it, the amygdala’s emotional intensity is reduced, and the cerebral cortex stores the memory as part of a coherent autobiographical narrative. This integrated process is the neurobiological foundation of trauma resolution. Once the trauma has been fully processed the symptoms and behaviours fade as they are no longer necessary.",1754669872.0,3,4,ptsd,ptsd

1mkoqie,The news has been so draining lately,"Going through a PTSD flare up right now, and I just feel so exhausted by everything going on right now.

I’m trying to stay informed with all the stuff going on right now, but much of the stuff being covered on the news right now is way too triggering for me to deal with at the moment, and seeing all the comments related to news hasn’t been making things any better either. (I’m at the point that I think I just need to take a break from keeping up with it all)

Like I expected there to be a couple people victim blaming in the comment section, but the sheer amount of comments I’ve read that have been victim blaming survivors and accusing people of making their traumatic experience up has been making up almost half of the comments I’ve read, and it’s quite infuriating honestly.

I’m not one to get angry easily, but this is making me angry and sick to my stomach.

I try and see the best in people, but for goodness sake, society is not making it easy right now.
 
I’m just so sick and tired of the fact that victims rarely have justice for what happens to them because so many people just don’t listen or believe what we have to say.

Like no matter what you say or do, they find ways to flip it around and turn the blame on you.

People say, if something happens, you should speak up, but the moment you try to speak up you are met with accusations of lying or making it up.
Or
Being told you’re being over dramatic and really just “regretted it”

They tell you must have wanted it
They tell you the person would never do such a thing
They call you derogatory names because your a woman
They ask you what you were wearing that “provoked” them
They tell you it couldn’t have happened because your a man,
Even worse, they’ll have the audacity to call you “lucky”

Like what the hell people

Speaking up about these things is hard enough already and often time it’s even dangerous to do so, so to be met with all of this the moment you come forward to speak up about it is downright awful and disgusting.

This is the last thing a person who’s just been through trauma should have to deal with, and I just wish more of society actually had empathy and took time to listen.

When this sort of thing happens, it’s not a one time down and over event you simply get over, the effects often linger and stick with you.
When a person victim blames, those words are re-traumatizing  and only reinforce silence.

I’ve had people ask me if I was in a war when I’ve shared that I have PTSD, as if that’s the only “valid” way to get it. The question itself is rude—not only because it pries into someone’s trauma, but also because it completely ignores the reality that PTSD can come from many forms of trauma.

PTSD doesn’t just come from war. It can come from childhood abuse, sexual assault, car accidents, medical trauma, domestic violence, neglect, emotional abuse, witnessing violence, and so many other life-threatening or deeply distressing experiences. It’s not a competition over who has the “most legitimate” trauma. Trauma is personal—and invalidating someone else’s suffering just because it doesn’t fit a narrow stereotype is harmful.

TW: Sexual Violence, Self-harm, Suicide

Long post warning but I would appreciate even one person to read it and take note of the main message. 

I have debated whether to post about this, mostly because I feel I am to blame but if the following makes even one person take precaution and be prepared for what could come from their post, then I am happy with that… 

It was 4am a few weeks back and I was in an absolute state of panic and terror. I don’t want to disclose too many details in fear that someone will find my old post (on another account which I have now abandoned). I had a flashback and continued to suffer panic attacks for several hours. My throat felt like a rope was being tightened around my neck, my vision became blurry, my heart was jumping through my chest, I threw up several times, my thoughts were racing at a pace I just couldn’t keep up with and I  couldn’t type properly I was shaking that much. 

I was DESPERATE for someone to help but as most of you can relate, I didn’t want to burden anybody. Not even the emergency helplines despite that being their job. So I decided to create an alt account and post on one of the subreddits dedicated to survivors of sexual abuse. I NEEDED someone to talk to, someone who could even remotely relate to my experiences. Just anybody to listen. I was in so much fucking pain, it was like my soul was being sucked from my body and it felt like it would never end. 

So I posted, detailing my experience and that I needed someone to talk to, to make sense of it, to listen to me, literally just assurance that not every human being is a piece of shit… I get no comments but within minutes my DMs are FLOODED. I mean more than a dozen messages came through. What I saw made my blood run cold. 

I should mention here that the moderators of these subreddits make it clear that users should disable the ability for them to receive private messages, to report users to them who violate this and also to Reddit for disturbing content. But I was new to these communities and just in a state of panic, I never even saw those warnings. Hence, it’s my own fault. 

The following are samples of what I can recall from the messages sent to me by other users. I will add a spoiler as they can be very triggering and are just fucking sick. (I hope I do it correctly, I have never tried before) 

>!You weren’t raped. You were trained like a dog and you loved it.!<
>!It isn’t possible to rape women, it shouldn’t even be illegal.!<
>!You’re a whore. Your body reacted the way it did because you obviously wanted it.!<
>!You reached orgasm and you call that rape? Lmao bitch your pussy was ready for the pounding.!<
>!You can’t call that rape, you signalled you wanted to get railed. You literally asked for it.!<
>!They ran a train through you HAHAHA fucking slut.!<
>!In one message, I was sent screenshots of a video where a woman was being gang raped.!<

Others asked for the disturbing details of my experience. They wanted to know exactly how I felt, what I felt, what I tasted, what I smelled etc. One user tricked me. They appeared at the beginning to be very caring, they mentioned they had similar experiences and said I could talk to them if I needed to. I took what I could in that moment and word vomited every awful thing that happened to me. How dirty I felt, details of the abuse, how many there were, how I had already showered 3 times but my insides still felt fucking disgusting.  
This user then proceeded to tell me they were masturbating to my messages and how hot it was. I felt violated all over again.!<

I logged out of the account, I don’t even remember the password, I just wanted to forget that post was even made. I just sobbed, my heart had finally fully broke. Many of you will know first hand how evil human beings can be, but this was so god damn depraved and just so cruel. Maybe for some of you this isn’t a shock, but I was totally blindsided that this was even a thing. Before logging out, I checked some of their profiles and the fact that Reddit allow communities dedicated to rape fetishes to even exist makes me SICK to my stomach. The content of their posts was just too graphic… I never knew “misery porn” was even a thing. 

For days afterwards I just could NOT stop crying. My face was swollen, I had major headaches and I just stopped eating. My body felt like it had taken its final beating. I relapsed with self-harm after 5+ years clean before making an attempt on my life. It felt like any hope I ever had in people was destroyed beyond repair, everything was just so dark. In a moment of desperate need, complete strangers took enjoyment (YET AGAIN) in my pain and misery. In online communities dedicated to victims/survivor’s of the most awful experiences life has to offer, there are literal freaks lurking these same communities to target people like me and you. 

After this experience, I have nothing left for anyone to take. I was abused for years as a child/teenager, my body became like a rag doll, limp and defenceless. People could do what they wanted because it was no longer MY body. After years of therapy, I was rebuilding my foundation and in one night of impulsiveness, total strangers broke it all over again. 

I don’t want sympathy or pity, this was only a hard lesson learned. I just desperately want to warn you about the risk of sharing your traumatic experiences in communities dedicated to people like us. Not every person in here is human at even the basic level. I hate how bleak that sounds, maybe one day with enough therapy I can become hopeful again. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and please be sure to share this warning with new users to your communities in the event you detect they are panic posting without knowing the risks. I want to share this post in several communities and then I will abandon this account. I made it simply because I wanted to get this message out there.

EDIT: I have just come back to this post and I'm overwhelmed by the supportive comments in r/PTSD and r/CPTSD. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read and respond, sincerely. I've read every response and feel better knowing that I'm not the only one to have endured such exploitative depravity. 

I want to genuinely thank the mods at r/PTSD and r/CPTSD for allowing this post to stay. I was insta banned from several adjacent subreddits which is unfortunate but I respect the decision.  I really hope it remains and is used to help others who may have similar experiences.

I will now be abandoning this account to focus on my recovery. I wish every single one of you the best of luck in your own journey to healing and hope you find the ability to be as kind to yourself as you have been to me. 

Take care and much love to you. ❤️",1754533261.0,361,63,ptsd,ptsd

But halfway through holding reception to well wishes in my hospital bed, a grand auntie kept pushing to get more info. Asking the same questions on repeat even when I said I don’t want to discuss it.

Then the memories came flooding back. Like I am used to thought spirals, this time… is different. I know what happened next. Almost every vertebrae and rib I have has fractures, my legs are mangled. Like it’s not catastrophising, it’s literally what happened.

The people who were with me and saved my life… they been protecting me, but the little I heard… yeah, everything tallies. These memories are real. The AirPods that spilled out of me as I fall… is right there.

And my anxiety is genuinely terrified with the self-blame and guilt that will come, from experience of knowing my brain.

I had PTSD before the accident, but that was just psychological trauma. It’s so fundamentally different when you literally feel your broken body that resulted from the trauma itself.

Would welcome advice.

1mkdz2q,Is it okay to not want sex until I LIVE in the same house with my partner?,"Me again, not so long ago I posted about my boyfriend of nearly two years wanting intimacy with me. We never did anything more than kissing, and as a rape victim (in a past relationship) I honestly didn't even want to have THAT talk with him. He had always respected my boundaries and suggested we went step by step. I ended up telling him that we could try that, but no penetration yet.

The thing is, I'm 18 and he's 20, we're both university students and living with our parents, house is never alone and we wouldn't find a moment to, as we agreed, start being more intimate. He suggested a hotel but I'm not fond of the idea. I've been thinking about this since he ever told me he wanted to be more intimate with me, and I think I wouldn't be comfortable if it wasn't in a place I can call my own.

My high school best friends are completely different, one of them is in a committed relationship of also 2 years and she tells me they do go to hotels to have sex, then my other friend is single, goes to parties and sleeps with a some guy she meets there (sometimes just orals, not neccessarily having sex but ykwim). I feel weird for overthinking the topic of sex with my partner when it seems so easy for others. I know this is normal for people my age but why do I feel strange? I feel like the only way I could EVER have sex with my boyfriend is when we're both done studying, get money and start living together, and that would be in 4 years and I don't know if he could wait. On top of that, I don't know if I even want to have sex even though I told him we would eventually get there. I guess my brain associates it with something negative. 

I'm not christian nor believe that you should neccessarily be married for this, I just feel kind of afraid and even repulsed by the idea of someone touching my body intimately again. I already agreed to go step by step and that we would eventually have sex but honestly I don't know anymore. I feel off and weird for not being like others my age.",1754605344.0,10,6,ptsd,ptsd

I have no memory of my childhood. When I really think about it, the only things I remember are the shitiest parts of my life. I had a vague memory of something happening and finally brought it up to my mum who confirmed that I was a victim of cocsa when I was 5. This led to hypersexuality which led to a whole lot of quilt and self hatred.

When I was in school I was SAd by a classmate. I had to attend school with him for a year following the assault despite him pleading guilty and being charged. During all of this I was threatened by a stranger in an alley and in a minor car crash.

After GCSEs I got a job. Worked myself until I broke and since then I've basically done nothing. I've tried to work again but every job I get makes me suicidal. 

Now I'm debating going to college but I went to the building today and now I'm in so much pain just from doing the journey once.

I feel utterly useless to everyone around me.

I feel like a huge disappointment.

I'm sick of this. 

This is the first time for as long as I can remember that I've not been depressed and still I'm not happy. Nothing I do is enough. I can't keep up with everyone around me and I'm sick of people having to carry me through shit.

I'm sick of trying my hardest just to achieve 10% of the stuff everyone else does everyday. Why does it have to be so complicated?

1mkmx4s,recovering from trauma and unsure where to move,"Almost a year ago, I was sexually assaulted by a friend. The fallout from this was horrible— I lost an entire friend group and was alone my entire freshman year as no one believes me. I was constantly talked about and harassed about being a liar + slut shamed after my ex friends and assaulter told many people on campus. I am now a sophomore in college and I still feel like nothing in my life has changed. 

I am very heavily struggling with my mental health and not sure where to go. I was in an emergency mental health clinic for about a month right after the assault, but I only felt okay for a couple months. Now that I’m on summer break, my stress is worse than ever. 

I’m unsure of how normal any of these feelings are for PTSD? I just wanted some insight or opinions from anyone who might relate to these feelings. I have horrible insomnia, mostly caused by extreme paranoia and stress. However, I’m not sure how much of this is anxiety or something else. I often feel as if the people who were involved are out to get me. When I say this, I don’t mean it as in a ‘ruining my reputation’ aspect. I genuinely convince myself these people are actively trying to get me to end my own life and want me dead. I often look around my house and under my bed + in my closet multiple times a day because I have convinced myself people are following me and watching. In my worst moments, I convince myself these people are sent from the devil and are demons sent from hell to get me. I am not religious whatsoever, and know this is irrational. Despite this, there is nothing I can do to convince myself otherwise in these moments of paranoia. I truly believe this when I am in this headspace. I have extreme trust issues and no longer have friends. I am convinced everyone is out for me and knows my business.

I don’t have anyone in my life to share my story with so I’ve resorted to putting this out on multiple subreddits just so I can feel satisfaction of sharing. so my issues started when I was 12, (I’m 19 now) and I was browsing online and decided that posting a picture of myself would be a good idea. long story short, it was not. a man reached out to me, he was 41. it started off the way all grooming goes, nice person, wants to be friends, nothing sexual. then one day he asked for another picture of me. I sent it, and he was able to find my house location from there. once he had that blackmail over me, he didn’t hide who he was anymore. he became open about his affinity for hurting woman and got me involved. he made me create a social media account where he made me post nudes which he promoted to men with the same interests as him. This went on for a year. I obtained 900 followers, all awful people like him. Eventually I too did some digging into his background and found out he was married, has a wife and a daughter. Later he addmited To me that he had assaulted his daughter and I called the police.

I don’t have a diagnosis and I’m not seeking one at the moment, on this sub or otherwise. I was in an abusive relationship for two years when I was in high school (15-16). I’ll spare most of the details but it was extensive sexual and emotional/verbal abuse from someone my own age. It has permanently damaged my relationship with my body and vulnerability in general. I’m now 20 years old and I guess I didn’t fully realize how bad things were in my head. 

I broke up with my ex at the end of 2021 and I started smoking weed at the beginning of 2022. I promise this information is important lol. Weed has been one consistent thing in my life that has helped with a lot of my physical pain and chronic nausea (and also acted as a coping mechanism), but I recently started a long t-break and I realized something was really off. 

I’ve smoked everyday, often multiple times a day, for over three years now. Every time I take a break, I have horrific dreams about my ex, usually him telling me I made everything up and I’m a liar, or him just laughing at me and attacking me. I suppose I’m grateful for weed because it’s been effective in suppressing my traumatic memories, but I’m not sure if that’s a good thing anymore. Instead of acknowledging it, I mostly ignore it and get high. I have become really good at emotional suppression over the years and sometimes I don’t even realize I’m doing it. But now it’s been almost four years since we broke up and I find myself feeling like I’m still under his control. 

I have days and weeks at a time where everything reminds me of him and it causes extreme distress. It’s especially bad when I smell something that reminds me of him, I get so scared and nauseous and I start to feel like he’s still there. It doesn’t help that he has occasionally reached out to me pretty much every year since we broke up. In 2023, he posted something mocking me and literally saying he is “10x better” than anything I’ll ever be. He called me a slut online even after he admitted to abusing me. I haven’t tried dating or even flirting with anyone in the four years since we broke up because I am horrified.

I became so good at a combination of emotional suppression and self medication that I guess I didn’t realize how not healed I am. Today I was reminded that he lives a normal happy life and it made me so angry I just couldn’t think. Every self help book says that you shouldn’t concern yourself with how your abuser is living because it doesn’t help you heal, but it’s hard not to when he lives a life I don’t think he deserves. 

It disgusts me to see him surrounded by friends who have no idea what he did. Part of me wants to expose him but that involves a level of attention and commitment I just can’t do. I already struggled to consider myself a victim, I do not have the strength to convince other people of it too. 

I just don’t know how to cope any more than I already have. I don’t think I can go on without professional help but that just doesn’t feel like an option right now. Idk. I feel stuck, hence why I’ve turned to reddit to run my mouth about it. I’m a college student and I feel like I’m supposed to be mingling and having fun but I’m too scared to talk to anyone I don’t already know and it feels like any flirtatious gesture from someone is a threat to my safety. I just want to enjoy being young but I can’t.

TLDR: I used weed to cope with my trauma and it did not work at all. ",1754615941.0,3,5,ptsd,ptsd

1mk53r2,How trauma=PTSD makes people with PTSD feel,"With the trauma awareness trend in the US, paradoxically it can also cause people with PTSD be more buried and swept under the rug.  It used to be something only soldiers get, but now is increasingly going to the other extreme, where it's considered progressive for PTSD to be seen as ubiquitous. It's re-defined as things like anxiety, panic, rumination, dissociation, phobias, strong emotional reactions to triggers, depression.. sometimes calling them ""emotional flashbacks"" to allow it to be given the PTSD or CPTSD moniker. Effectively being a validation of mental illness instead of a specific disorder. 

But most common mental disorders are associated or linked at their core with some kind of trauma, especially in childhood. They're very serious disorders, and the diagnosis should be seen as validating, but didn't get associated by the trend with trauma like PTSD/CPTSD did.  Attachment disorder (emotional neglect or trauma from caregivers as a child) is another that can be extremely painful and debilitating, and is certainly linked to mental illnesses, yet it's not often talked about in relation to it.  Instead was re-defined as CPTSD, often with symptoms of anxiety or depression. And someone with PTSD/CPTSD can have those disorders comorbid as well, adding to the confusion.

A major effect of course is making it more difficult to get qualified treatment, which arguably is the most damaging result of it. Practitioners are listing PTSD/CPTSD in their qualifications when in actuality they aren't qualified. But the emotional impact is not being seen by anyone, understood or helped. That affects many people significantly, just making an already severe condition worse. I asked AI about how it might affect someone with PTSD emotionally and got this response. It was interesting because it's unusually empathetic and accurate..

1mjzlfv,me and my cousin both remembered what our uncle did. and i don’t know what to do now,"hi. i just felt the need to share this and came across this sub.

a couple of days ago, my sister, my cousin (who’s the same age as me), and i were spending time together. we hadn’t seen each other for two years, but we all gathered in the same city for a cousin’s wedding. at some point, we started talking about our family, past traumas, etc. then my cousin implied that she had experienced something. she was about to cry. she looked at me and in that moment, we both understood that we had gone through something similar.

---

i’ve had this memory for a long time. i was around 6 or 7 years old, lying in bed, when my uncle (who was around 17-18 at the time) suddenly came in one morning and licked my butt and touched me in that area. i suppressed this memory for years and told no one. for a long time, i even questioned if it was real.

---

that day, my cousin said she remembers something that affected both of us. she said she had experienced abuse several times, especially since our uncle stayed with their family for a long time. she was crying, and the whole thing made me and my sister cry too. then she shared a memory of him taking me on his lap and touching me when no one else was around during a visit. she also remembered calling my name to get me away from him. i don’t remember anything about this moment, and learning about it made me incredibly sad. it scared me how much i might have forgotten.

---

i’ve always disliked maybe even hated my uncle and kept my communication with him limited. but somehow, i ended up in a similar career path (academia). he went to the uk for his master’s, and now that i’ve been accepted to a fully funded phd program in the uk, my mom encouraged me to talk to him. and this month, i probably spoke to him more than in my entire life. on the surface, i felt okay, but only because i was suppressing things.

since the wedding was in another city, our whole family including him was staying in the same house. he’s almost 40 now, married a 22-year-old last year, and works at a dumb university. he’s an angry, annoying person who creates drama over the smallest things.

anyway, after talking to my cousin that day, all my anger resurfaced. i felt the need to completely ignore him and my cousin felt the same. that day, he started yelling over something stupid (especially at my mom), so my sister yelled back. and for the first time in my life, i yelled at him too. i said, “you think i don’t know what you’ve done, huh?” he looked shocked and kept yelling, “what have i done?” and i replied, “i won’t tell. just don’t talk to me ever again.” at some point he walked to my sister and made a pressure her hand and then i hit his arm couple of times. he continued yelling at everyone for a while. that night, my sister and i left and returned to our city.

---

i don’t know. i feel both relieved and confused. i’m not sure if i did the right thing. here are some of my thoughts. maybe someone can share their perspective:

-do you think what he did was a crime, considering he was 17–18 years old?

-would it have been better to keep suppressing this memory and not talk to my cousin about it? or will confronting it help in the long term?

-is my decision to cut off contact with him the right one? or will this only make things more complicated? my cousin is thinking of pretending nothing happened and keeping limited contact when necessary.

-remembering the day i yelled and hit at him made me feel relieved but also embarrased. some of my relatives saw me like that for the first time. do you think it's natural to feel this way? was this behaviour/approach bad?

-i feel sick knowing i’m on a similar career path as him. he went to the uk for his master’s, and now i have the chance to do a phd there. it makes me question everything, like maybe i shouldn’t do it at all or even work in academia.

1mk7aqp,"Severe Anhedonia, numbing, and blunting after trying to process Trauma.","Long story short the pandemic really reactivated a lot of negligence related trauma from earlier in my life. In the height of the pandemic I was strangely calm and maybe a little numb. As things opened back up and people moved and didn't take precautions my anxiety went through the roof and my ptsd symptoms came back really bad. The emotional damn broke six month ago where I went from bad stress responses to finally being able to cry. The past six months I'm having breakdowns weekly after my therapy session as things are finally being felt. Anyway last month in therapy we targeted two specific memories from past and its like I'm processing both the original trauma and the pandemic at the same time. The past month I've felt really unstable and am feeling lower lows that feel so similar to my worst moments immediately after the trauma but I'm also expressing all the pain and anger to a greater degree as well. I feel like I got the tears out and everything but I'm now experiencing next level anhedonia and emotional disconnection. I'm used to feeling numb and having to trust what I know vs what I feel but in recent days I'm having moment where I can't even recall what I know very well. Like its almost like OCD where I'm doubting what is true. I know processing trauma rewires the brain but lately its my recall ability is broken both mentally and emotionally. I'm having thoughts like ""is this what I believe, do I love my family, etc. Its liek I can't tell or recall if I ever cared or ever felt anything. I'm calming down but even at my best the past few weeks I just feel like everything both good and bad has lost its emotional charge or connection to me. It feels like an over correction or like a hole in my soul. Its just a degree of anhedonia and blunting to both mind and body that I feel like I will never be myself again. I'm taking a break from processing memories in therapy but I'm just left feeling severely empty. I can't tell if feeling empty from processing things or if I'm just in a state of next level dissociation. Anybody every experienced something like this? I feel really calm but messed up as well. Its really weird I can't even feel my normal anxieties. I only get restless when I notice how empty everything feels. ",1754589833.0,4,3,ptsd,ptsd
1mkfmeh,Feeling dreadful before the first date,"We’ve been talking to each other for a few months and finally we have a date planned in around a week. The person is head to toe into me (borderline in love) and they already talk about being together in the future. 
The closer the date comes, the more dreadful I feel. Like it’s impossible for someone to like/love me, I don’t deserve being loved, they’ll be disappointed when they see me both physically and mentally. They liked me for my appearance at first, and then of course fell for me because of my mentality. However I feel like catfishing because on pictures I use good angles and light and irl it can be harsh (so if the appearance is the first thing they loved, it can fall out quickly).
Usually I would back off and cancel the date (which I did so many times in the past years) but I really like the person, and I see that we can have future together.
So as for now I’m still on, but I’m 90% sure that the date will fail and our connection will fall out. 
I had a lot of psychological traumas during both  my childhood and adulthood, so of course it comes from this. I feel extra defensive about myself.

1mkcsmq,Would guys ever date me even if I’m traumatised?,"I’m sorry if it’s weird to ask but I’m in high school and I always feel very left out by guys in my year/grade. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and not to sound insanely egotistical, I think I can be quite smart, fun, and non-ugly(?) but I still feel like I am an annoyance to the guys that I talk to or have crushes on. It definitely makes me feel ugly, and I’ve felt this way since I was 12 and the first guy I had a crush on told all the girls in our class that he’d rather date ‘anyone but me’. And when I was 11 and a 16 year old boy I never spoke to and his girlfriend randomly told me that I was ‘so fucking ugly’ for no reason. It really hurt, but I’m not sure why he felt that way, because like I said, I don’t think I am that bad of a person. 

Many of the people my past crushes ended up dating are usually a lot shorter, outgoing, and paler than I am. I’m beginning to believe that my looks are the issue: although I am not ‘ugly’ I don’t have a ‘dateable’ appearance, and I look embarrassing to be around, especially for some of my crushes who were shorter than me. I am really dark and tall, and I guess that’s not as desirable for guys in my area, who go for short British girls with straight hair and stuff.

I find conversation quite hard too and I am a bit introverted. While I don’t think I have social anxiety or anything, I don’t engage in much conversation with people, and I don’t have many friends. A lot of girls my age have tons of friends and go to many parties but I live far from my school area and never get invited to any. I do have mental issues- I recently got diagnosed with autism which was originally thought to be a ‘mood disorder’, but I haven’t told anyone and I thought I masked it quite well in school. I’m worried that guys see this as weird and that is the reason they avoid me.

Another reason I think is because of school rumours. Last year, I was raped by a guy in my year, and he still is in my classes and stuff. I affected me terribly- people act school thought that I was pregnant, and I was getting blamed by random boys outside of school for lying. I feel like I’m just too difficult for people to love me, let alone any guy. I try to act normal, but I feel like I’m just too ‘different’ you know? Getting prettier or louder didn’t help because I still feel the same. I’m only 15 so I’ve heard that it gets better, but I’ve already been hearing that for years and it never has. I’m scared that I’ve already been through too many mature things and that I’m not a fun or innocent girl anymore. ",1754602456.0,0,4,ptsd,ptsd

I'm 25 now, and I am starting to have a vague memory.

Has anyone experienced this? If so, did you discover that you were actually assaulted?

And how do you heal from this forcing male energy? Like how can you breathe past it and not let it consume you?

I never sought any kind of help as part of my trauma involves the mental health system and doctors. I really want to stop feeling this way but I'm so scared that by trying to seek treatment it'll make everything even worse and I'd much prefer to avoid that. I won't do CBT or take medication so I don't really know what options there are apart from that.

1mjlsmb,How can I be okay with getting skinnier/healthier when it also triggers me,"I am unsure where to begin or how to explain, so I will just try. I haven’t really spoken about this outside of professional settings and my boyfriend, so please excuse me if I can’t clarify or name things properly.

My Ex groomed me from an early age (14) into being okay with being sexualised and soon when I was 18 start selling pictures of me, or pay me to go out and videotape myself with strangers I met in clubs. My therapist says that I was groomed and manipulated to do it, that he is psychopath and that I should learn more about them to understand what he did to me. I am trying to do so and… honestly I- I have a hard time accepting that it might not be entirely my fault? I simply had no one else to talk to or compare things to, which made stuff inherently worse.

I was with him for 7 years and made it out by… being too fat for him and standing up for myself. I said I didn’t want to continue with the stuff and I didn’t care as much about my weight, which made him sought out someone that could fulfill his fantasies. He convinced me to be poly with him (which I hated) til My now boyfriend helped me get out of it (he was the first one i ever told what really was going on). 


 I am now in a different country, we are together for almost 2 years. I am studying something I like and I am on medication and getting treatment for my ptsd. We are also moving soon into our first own apartment.


I am unsure of how to legally proceed against my ex, i don’t think I am ready for that and don’t want anyone in my family finding out. They disappointed me too often in that regard.


While I am healing, I also start feeling my body again. I didn’t really feel it for most of the time when I was in that place. I had an ED, it got better after a few years (which my ex hated) and he tried to convince me to lose weight. I tried, but ended up due to mental issues in the hospital for months where I gained 15kg because of the medication and me barely moving. I weighed 95kg and am 163cm tall. My Ex couldn’t handle it and wanted me to lose weight, tried motivating me but I just… couldn’t and wasn’t happy with that. My ex always criticised everything on me, even when I was skinny, and I always felt too fat (i weighed 59kg and below at times) but over the years with other medications i genuinly gained weight and it stayed.


When I drew all these lines, it started falling out. Thank god.



My boyfriend doesn’t care about my weight, but I do. With therapy and everything going on, I realised i feel disconnected and not happy with my body. I wanna be athletic again (i used to do sports/dance/etc.) and it was something that gave me joy before my ex took control of that, too. Now I am slowly trying to tap into what used to be fun or cool for me, without being scared of what my ex would do. I am still scared but I just act like I am okay. I wanna be healthier (i weigh around 89kg rn i think) but I am scared.


Being thicker, helped me get rid of my ex. People don’t look at me as lustfully or simply don’t think I am pretty or worthy their time as much. It is sad but when I was skinny and dressed openly, people definitely interacted with me more (even though it was just to touch me). 

Being thicker feels like a protection that I am now scared to let go off. Whenever I lose a bit, I get- closer to the sights where I see their hands roam my body and it- is hard to be okay with that sometimes.

But also, I feel like my body is not my own. I feel almost like overstimulated just be feeling my belly flaps or whatever fold up and down whenever i move, my chest feels too heavy and broad (currently on F and was a D) and I hate the way I look and feel. 

I want to… connect to my body and lose weight mindfully, but I get scared snd demotivated fast. 


I also know that staying my current weight is not the answer. No matter how much I weight, I will always… always feel their hands on me. No matter how often I shower, rub my skin off, boil it away… it doesn’t go. So might as well try and build a body that can protect itself and I can feel connected to and confident in.

I am sorry if I am rambling so much, I just think some information is necessary and it also feels kinda freeing to be able to tell people without them seeing my face or knowing who I am and I also don’t see yours or know you. So you can give me a clear judgement? I feel like I am unsure of what things that I think is maybe normal or not. 

I am 24, but i don’t feel like it, either. Despite it all, my ex was not the worst thing that happened to me (def up there tho haha) so I just don’t remember much about… kind my whole life? Also having memory issues because of that. I am in therapy and all, again, getting medication and this country is really trying their best to help me but I am also just finding out stuff. Never knew I had ptsd or psychosis. My ex always made me belief i had BPD and was crazy (coming from a narcissist psychopath is actually crazy btw)

1mjkika,Childhood trauma?,"For as long as I can remember, I have been terrified of going swimming. I will go into a pool and have fun in a lake as long as I can stand up or stand up if I fall out of a pool floatie. However, once it gets to the point where I have to start swimming, I panic and turn around, or need help getting back. I do have a desire to learn how to swim. My remaining family members all love it, and so do my wife and her parents. But no matter how much I try to get past the fear and panic of ""deep"" water I can't. I have conquered my fear of snakes, heights, and so many other things except this. Any time I tried to bring it up to my parents growing up they just kind of dodged the question outside of one time when my Dad let slip that there was an accident when I was a toddler with no further details. I have had one dream that as a toddler I fell face first into a lake and was carried out a ways not able to turn myself around. I remember feeling like I was drowning. I think this may be the cause of it, but my mother has passed away and my father is in a care home, having a hard time remembering who I am at times and has no memory of it. I am sure this is why I have such a fear of swimming. I am not sure how to tackle this, when I am in water I feel like I have no control over myself or my body.

1mj447v,"10 years later, PTSD still triggered","My ex husband was violent and angry, endangering my infant and I 10 years ago. Since then, I have tried hard to coparent amicably with him and be as low conflict as possible. Partially for the sake of our child, but also because I was terrified to anger him. Our child has had visitation with him over the years and come back with stories of his treatment towards his wife, and I had seen the bruises. Now the truth is out that he has been abusing all this time, sometimes while my daughter was present. I’m feeling triggered by his wife’s account of her injuries and the incidents she endured, and it’s taking me back there. My daughter has asked for the truth and I gave it, but it’s reopened the old wounds. I am angry and sad and scared as if all those months of therapy never happened. 

I’ve struggled over the years because our child has special needs. There were times when she would become violent in the same ways he was and I was triggered to hide and protect myself because it was so reminiscent. I didn’t realize that my unhealed PTSD was effecting how I parented her. Through counseling, we have learned better ways to parent her and work thru issues before she becomes violent which has helped immensely, but I have guilt that I took so long to crack the code and that I parented from that place of fear for so long. 

In an effort to support their relationship, I kept the secrets of what had happened. I tried hard not to let my fears taint their interactions, but helped to build safety plans and teach her how to call for help. I understand now that I compartmentalized my trauma to try to build a life for us and pretend that our family was normal, that we just divorced amicably. I helped to craft this narrative that it was all good and we were friends while deep down I was still fearful. Deep down I knew it would happen again but felt powerless to stop it. Now watching the cycle happen again 10 years later with stepmom, I’m having flashbacks and fear, and now guilt that my child is aware of it all. 

I feel like I need to live in my counselors office right now because the feelings are ever present and wash over me, but I still have to make breakfast and care for my kids like nothing is happening. How the hell do I pretend I’m not quaking inside while snuggling and playing?? How do i act as a stable safe sane parent while I feel like a panicked child? ",1754485431.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd

They spoke so loudly,  
I forgot I had a voice.  
They felt so fiercely,  
I learned to hide my feelings  
like contraband.

They told me what to think  
before I knew what thinking was.  
Their pain became my mirror—  
cracked, and never mine.

They handed me their shame  
as if it were a blanket.  
They buried their fear  
in my quiet heart  
and called it discipline.

I carried it all—  
the storm they never named,  
the silence they never healed,  
the hunger they masked with power.

And for years,  
I mistook their voices for mine.  
I thought my sadness  
was a flaw.  
My anger  
a danger.  
My truth  
a betrayal.

But now—  
I am learning the difference  
between inherited fear  
and my own wisdom.

I am unlearning the silence.  
I am rewriting the map.

I’m wondering what your experiences are with maintaining long term relationships as someone with CPTSD? Also interested in any perspective of someone who doesn’t have it but their partner does. 

Basically have severe DV trauma from childhood as well as CSA and SA which makes intimacy really hard for me. 

I started my therapy journey 5 years ago and was single/celibate during that time. I recently started a relationship about 10 months ago, and this time with someone very safe. But I still feel like they will never truly understand me because they don’t understand the experience of living with CPTSD. 

I feel grateful they are caring, loving and patient but I also feel like there’s still a disconnect because they just don’t get it. I feel a bit robbed that I have to be grateful for this when I didn’t do anything to deserve the assault or abuse in the first place. I causes resentment. I wonder if maybe I’m destined to be alone, or should consider being with someone who also has it..Though I think that may be even more challenging to navigate two different sets of triggers. 

It feels in some ways even more isolating than being alone, to be with someone who doesn’t understand the complexity of our worlds. What’s your thoughts or experience? ",1754483367.0,2,6,ptsd,ptsd

Im a young woman from Balkan (Europe), and I never thought I would be writing something like this but Im feeling lost, ashamed, and emotionally devastated after a recent experience. A few weeks ago, I attended a work-related lunch with people from my industry. I ended up drinking more than I should have (possibly way too much) and I now have large memory gaps from that day. There are rumors going around that something sexual happened between me and one of the men involved, but I honestly dont remember most of it. Im terrified by the idea that something happened that I didnt consent to or that I did something humiliating without even realizing it. The worst part is that these rumors reached my family. I come from a conservative family and work in a male dominated field. My parents are devastated, and I feel like I have ruined their trust and damaged my professional reputation. I feel like people are seeing me as “that kind of woman,” and Im carrying a deep sense of shame, guilt, and humiliation.
I know I made mistake by drinking that much, but I just dont know how to start rebuilding. I feel like I lost my dignity, my confidence, and my ability to move forward.

1mj6gp9,First meltdown on third traumatic anniversary?,"Hey all. I have been reaaaalllly struggling mentally for maybe a couple weeks now. There was a traumatic event that happened in Aug 2022. I am married (Me: 37M Her: 34F) and we were relocating states at that time. I was staying behind with the kids to finish house while she started work. She was staying with family (mine) in our new city. First night in the new city on our MacBook, I saw text messages between her and my cousin (my mom’s sister is his mom). I thought that was awesome. Then I looked into it and saw it was nsfw complete with pics of his dick. He was wanting advice for his Only Fans and also offered her a replica dildo of his penis. She turned down the dildo to the best of my memory but freely gave him advice and complemented his penis and has said things to him that she has never said to me in our relationship (Together: 13 Married: 12). I was obviously hurt and confused. I confronted and I don’t remember how it went but she didn’t seem for it to be much of an issue to her. I on the other hand was screaming and hitting things like a madman in our empty house that I loved to move to a new city that also loved that was a life long dream. That dream felt tainted now. To top it off the whole family knows except for that cousin’s fiancé. At the time of that they were only dating. They are the darlings of the family but she is the only one in the dark and it has been absolutely killing me that I know what I know.

I don’t remember having this sort of a reaction the previous 2 anniversaries. Can all of a sudden this just explode like this on a random anniversary year? I have done things like leave the house in the middle of the night for 6-7 hours just to drive and be completely alone because I just can’t. She’s gotten mad and doesn’t understand.

1milwsy,I was recently diagnosed with PTSD from a traumatic night in college. I just started EMDR and I’m struggling emotionally—has anyone been through something similar?,"In 2013, I was a college student returning home from a fraternity party on a charter bus provided by the fraternity. Usually, the bus had two drop-off spots. That night, it was pouring rain, and I asked the social chair—one of my best friends at the time—if the driver could drop me off at the second location, even though I was the only one who needed it.

After the first drop-off, the driver started going the wrong way. I politely asked if he could turn around and head toward my stop, but instead of responding normally, he yelled at me to come sit near him. I was scared, but I walked up to the front. He threw a rag on the floor and told me to sit there. I did.

He started touching me—rubbing on me. I remember my phone battery was at 3%, and I was wearing party clothes from the night, feeling incredibly vulnerable. I tried to make excuses, saying my boyfriend was waiting for me. The driver taunted me, saying things like, “Then why are you here alone?”

I tried calling and texting the social chair, who was telling me to stay on the phone as long as I could, to describe landmarks, to help them find me. But the driver kept heading toward the freeway.

At one point, I jumped up and ran to the doors, pounding on them, begging him to let me out. He shouted at me to stop, but eventually, he pulled the bus over in the middle of a five-lane road and opened the door.

I took off running in little gold boat shoes and eventually found a 24-hour donut shop. Because of the storm, the shop had been sheltering unhoused people. I ran inside and hid at a table. The driver ran in after me. A homeless man stood up, yelled at him to leave, and came to sit next to me. He stayed with me, protected me, and waited until my friends arrived in a taxi to get me.

Today, more than a decade later, I started EMDR therapy because I was recently diagnosed with PTSD. This has all been weighing so heavily on me. The memories are coming back in waves, and some of the fear I buried is starting to surface again.

I guess I’m just reaching out to ask:
Does it get better?

1mizg5s,How to heal from trauma,"Hi, I would like some advice / self help books recommendations on how to overcome trauma I have towards trusting people and being able to feel safe. 

I have been to therapy in the past when I was employed. My therapist recommended me meditation. She also helped me with using facts to help overcome my feelings of unworthiness and guilt. 

Unfortunately now I am unemployed, so I am unable to afford therapy. Hence I would like to know what I can do to help myself continue healing. I am based in Asia and in my country it's not possible to get the help I need unless I pay a lot of money.

I was watching the Epstein Files on Netflix and it brought up all the unresolved fear, self loathing, guilt and sadness I felt. 

My history: I was sexually assaulted by my ex-company's GM in an overseas work trip. The rest of the management covered up for him when I raised a HR case against him. After fighting a lot and enlisting the help of the female management in HQ, I succeeded in getting him fired.

This resulted in the management in Asia shunning me entirely and getting everyone to ostracized me and make me feel I was the one at fault. I was also told multiple times to just get over it.

I can't. I wish I can. I wish I can reverse time back to before all these happened. 

In the past, when it was just sexual harassment, where male leaders / co-workers just tried to invite me to their hotel rooms on work trips or tried to kiss me when hugging goodbye, I was still able to deal with it. 

With the sexual assault, I feel like I can no longer feel safe. And even though I tried to stand up for myself and protect other women from suffering the same fate as me, I was punished for it. 

I have tried very hard to heal. I took up sports. I dived into work. It didn't resolve the trauma. I don't know how to resolve the root cause of this pain and fear.

I was asked to leave in my recent 2 jobs. The company where I was sexually assaulted because I was on antidepressants and I was dealing with a lot of anxiety and panic attacks so I wasn't able to deliver up to my boss' standards. The most recent job because I was a troublemaker pushing for justice when a male management sent me a dick pic. The management tried to paint it that I invited the attention even though I explicitly told the guy not to send me a dick pic when he said he wanted to. I challenged management and eventually they found some reason to try to get me to resign on my own because I am not in line with the company's values. I got a lawyer and eventually we settled with them.

I have been unemployed for over a year now.

I went to travel in my own. I went for meditation retreats. I went to volunteer at meditation retreats. Meditating at the retreat helped. Trying to be a volunteer made me feel once again, I'm a problem. I don't fit in. I'm the problem.

I got told by the teacher or the meditation retreat I was volunteering at that I should get myself checked for bipolar disorder because my moods are like a roller coaster. 

This was when  I was trying to tell her this other volunteer was making me very uncomfortable. This volunteer was policing how much water I was using in my shower (the centre has reminders for us to use water mindfully as water is scarce there). I told her I haven't washed my hair in 3 days and I have a lot of hair to wash. 

She continued verbally telling me off and being passive aggressive. Even though I told her I need some space alone to process first. I left her in the common bathroom and went back to the dorm to put on lotion and clothes.

She went into our shared dorm shortly after when I was still naked and undressed and continued telling me off. I felt very unsafe even though I know physically nothing bad is going to happen to me. 

The teacher's response to me when I raised all these points is ""this is a safe environment. If you are not able to trust and feel safe here, how have you been surviving in the outside world?""

I told her I have personal space and time apart from people in the real world. 

But all these criticisms from people. All these little things like watching an Epstein documentary triggering such big responses in me scare me. 

I want to be normal again. But I don't know how to.

I would really appreciate any guidance on books / podcasts / YT channels that can possibly help me.

I have tried reaching out to older females whom I respect to ask for advice. What I realised is just sexual assault is much more common than I thought. And they are also trying to figure out how to heal in their own way.

I don't know what to do. Everyday I try to make sure I laugh, I talk to a loved one and I eat something yummy. 

But I feel like whilst everyone is getting ahead in life, I'm regressing and getting more and more confused how to be a normal person again. 

When I saw the TikTok videos of people pretending to have a conversation with their younger self, I cried. 

I don't know how to tell my younger self I failed to protect you. All these bad things happened. I let men take advantage of me. I let people abuse me. ",1754470287.0,2,2,ptsd,ptsd
1miw5e0,I think I relapsed for self harm but I don’t want to admit it,"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with PTSD about 2 1/2 years ago. I used to cut myself as a teenager but the last time I did was in 2021 (before the PTSD event). I didn’t really want to do it anymore because I found the scars embarrassing and then later because I got with my boyfriend and I knew I couldn’t hide it. 

Maybe 7-8 months ago when I got upset I started hitting myself hard across the face. I only did it a few times and stopped but the last week I’ve been doing it again. Doctors are trying to find medications to work for me and so far hasn’t been working so I’ve been very depressed. I hate myself a lot and struggle with body dysmorphia really bad. Sometimes I wish someone would mug me on the street or I’d just get punched by someone in town. I think I feel like if I punish myself enough I can forgive myself for what happened. 

But what I notice is I’ve been punishing myself for 3 years and I hate myself more and more everyday. When I hit myself and it stings I want to go harder and harder. I don’t because I can’t cause any injury that my boyfriend would see but I do it until my face is red. I want it to hurt and bruise but I hold back. 

I’ve been feeling very suicidal lately and been thinking a lot about committing. Only reason I haven’t is I don’t want to hurt my boyfriend and I’m scared I’ll mess up and remain alive but have damaged my body.

I haven’t told my therapist about the face hitting. I feel ashamed that I’m regressing. ",1754457761.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd

The meds help but my body knows and sometimes I wake up sideways from all the kicking and fighting. 

When am I supposed to rest? I get brief moments of calm, rare nights of rest, and even rarer days of low stress hormones. 

I don't understand why it's so difficult even after all the work I've been doing to manage and get better. I'm better but am I anywhere near where I was before? Not really. 50% maybe and I'll fucking take it. 

I'm just frustrated that it takes so long to process these things or maybe I'm doing something wrong. I don't know. 

I'll leave you with the best analogy I've ever heard. You're ability to handle stress = spoons. Normal people wake up with 4 big spoons and 4 little spoons and throughout the day those get used up but daily stressors. People with mental illnesses wake up with two of those big spoons already taken and normal daily stressors take up the rest of the big spoons and some of the little spoons. You get those back with self-care, gratitude, and acceptance, etc.

tw: ED, SA, hospitals

long story short when i was 13yo i went to CAMHS (shitty mental health service in england) cause i had really bad anorexia, the therapist guy was creepy as feck and made me feel like i could get sa'd at any moment, used to put his hand on my thigh, insist i be alone in a room with him, alot of my memories from this time are hazy cause my bmi was like 12 so i was pretty ill, but one day he said with my parents that because i wouldn't eat a sandwich he could lock the door and me and him could sit in there all day till i ate it, and that terrified me to death, then he took my weight in a separate room and we were alone and it's like my mind is blank, i felt so threatened he made me face the scales backwards so that he was leant over me and i swear he looked down my bra and said i bet you've got coins in there (to make the scales heavier), honestly my memory from then is like someone erased it but i just remember running out of that room shaking and i refused to ever go back to see him.

what followed was a year of impatient (yay! jk...), and as someone who never spent a night away from home it was so tricky, there was no therapy whatsoever it was pretty much gain weight off you go, yet 6 months in the creepy therapist guy turned up to see someone else and said how lovely i looked, obviously i smiled and just walked down the corridor, yet then came the shear PANIC. i was locked in this place and couldn't get out, yet he, the guy i was absolutely petrified of, could come in any time he liked. He'd sat in a certain seat in that room and i don't know which one but i didn't want to sit there, as if i didn't want 'him' on me. And that's where it all started...

I would bin old clothes that sat on any of the seats and shower as quickly as i could that evening because i didn't want him on me at all, i kept this all to myself because i didn't trust the staff. i thought when i left it would be better but it just spiralled even more. skip on like 10 years and overtime that fear of him being on me has warped into a fear of hurting others (like he did to me), any little feeling down there i get so fixated and stressed about thinking it means something deeper, i get horrible intrusive thoughts that make feel like the worst girl that ever lived. 

i'm a 23yo girl whose very VERY innocent minded, i like cute things and the thought of anything adult makes me feel sick!! i've never had a bf or dated and i don't want one till im way older, maybe it's cause im traumatised and still a 13yo but all kind of grown up stuff like getting a job, or yucky adult stuff, it scares me!! i also think part of my ED is wanting to be like a cute tiny little doll but that's another issue~ if i get a twinge down there or some discharge i instantly think it means i'm turned on and have to shower and feel absolutely disgusting.

also didn't help that my dad, my best friend in the whole world, died a couple years ago and i was a full time carer for him for 2 years, we were so alike and i miss having a little sunshine soulmate, also looking after him gave me like a purpose and took my mind off of alot.

I can cope with the flashbacks, the anxiety, the fear i can live with it i don't mind it, but the constantly feeling yucky and like the worst person ever is killing me. i can't do anything, i can't meet with people make friends because i constantly feel like complete shit (and want a shower all the time) i'm constantly asking my mum for reassurance like did i do something, touch something etc. and she must be so fed up with me by now but i'm just so scared. what do i do? i feel so alone like it's only just me. like i look at my cats and then a horrible thought will come into my head about sexually abusing them and ill get a twinge and i feel like a creep and and hate myself and end up crying quietly, i can't ever be happy. i also have ADHD so it makes everything worse cause i get hyper fixated on it and ahh. i'm on fluoxetine + concerta, have hyper mobility (highly suspect it's EDS) yet i've tried every tablet pretty much and im immune to them all as my gp says 😭✨ i've tried therapy yet mostly what i wish is to talk to someone in the same situation (if they even exist) to know i'm not alone, or a bad person, sorry for the messy vent",1754409200.0,18,6,ptsd,ptsd

A month ago my therapist said i likely have ptsd from a car crash that happend in ealry 2024. I was left with chronic pain that flares up during school due to my backpack.

My pain has changed over this summer, from dull pain (like 5 mins after u got kicked in the back) to sharp pain (like needles being in my muscle tissue).

I hate being a 16 year old with pain like an old man. Im a powerlifter, I feel weak. I dont like to cry, but im crying rn. 

It feels like it was that bad, my therapist did the screening on me and she didn't even count it. We made the choice that I shouldn't tell my parents (at least till it gets worse). I can't tell my brother, and i can't tell my friends (they dont even know im in therapy. And I fucking hate my generation with the whole ""everything is trauma"" shit.)

My pain makes my fear worse, and im going into my junior year, i am doing 3 APs and taking both the ACT and SAT. This year is going to be hell. School hasn't started but thinking about it makes me wanna kms.

1mifcr3,My boyfriend wants to have intimacy with me and I'm afraid of sex (tw for SA),"Tl;dr: afraid of talking about intimacy with my current bf who now wants to take that step.

I've been in a past relationship where the guy raped me and he would always touch me without my consent and be pushy about it. I'm now in a healthy relationship with my boyfriend, in about 3 months we'll celebrate two years together. Since the start he respected my boundaries and we have never fought, not even once. He's very sweet and when we talked about intimacy at the start, we agreed that it would be a big step that we could take when were both ready.

Recently, during a call he told me he would like to talk face to face with me about intimacy, we haven't touched that topic since I set my boundaries at the first months of our relationship. He said it wouldn't mean we should have sex, but maybe be more intimate with each other. And that he has been thinking about it for some months but never found the moment to tell me.

I feel really afraid about this conversation, like the very thought of having it scares me. It's not like I don't I enjoy physical touch, I love it when he kisses me, but the thought of having intimacy scares me. I haven't had sex in years after that relationship, I have touched myself so it's not like i don't have a libido, but I don't feel comfortable about letting another person touching my body, I think. Or touching someone else. I trust my boyfriend a lot but for some reason, this topic is very difficult for me. I know at the start I told him I would take that step when we were both ready, but now I don't know if I'll ever be ready.

1mipgmt,PTSD & psychosis questions,"I was diagnosed with ptsd in 2008 after a near death experience. In 2023 my life was at the most stressful point possible. I lost my house. My family threw away all of my belongings except some of my clothes. I was in a stressful environment living in a small office space in a family members house. I had spent my life savings on ketamine infusions for crps (neurological disease) & I wasn’t in remission so I thought I wasted everything I had. (Later went in remission) My family member didn’t want me there and I was facing homelessness. My family member was abusive. It was bad. 

The infusions gave me unrelenting panic attacks which lead to missed sleep, which lead to psychosis. I knew I was having a MH crisis. I woke up hallucinating & called an ambulance for myself. The hallucinations stopped with the first visit after sleeping. I continued to go back to the psych ward bc the meds they gave me made my anxiety & stress worse & worse. 

They diagnosed me bipolar & kept giving me antidepressants & mood stabilizers. Some were injections. But I knew i was sick & I knew my delusions were a MH crisis. I went to the hospital a total of 5 times in 4 months for haldol & klonopin. 

In that time I did become homeless & I lost my prescription for klonopin, so I went off of it cold turkey. My stress level was through the roof. I had nowhere to go, no car, could barely walk, couldn’t support myself and my family had all abandoned me bc they thought I was crazy. I moved into a friends attic. I didn’t want to risk it, so id go back to the hospital any sign of symptoms even more minor ones like paranoia or missing sleep or even just panic attacks. I believed it was bipolar & could get worse so I was scared.

They would give me haldol & klonopin & id come out of it & feel normal. So I went 4 more times. Theyd send me home with a prescription for mood stabilizers & the hyper vigilance, depersonalization & derealization would come back. Id go back, get my shot of haldol & try to convince them to change my meds again. My last visit I asked for risperidone bc I saw on Reddit it helps with anxiety & it finally calmed my anxiety and these attacks enough it stopped. 

I ran out of places to live & money. I moved to a better city. Went to a homeless shelter. Went into remission for crps finally. Got two jobs. Got a car. And now I’m finally in a good place in life. I have a good relationship. I have friends & family support from my former in laws. I don’t talk to the other side of the family. I have it good. 

But now theyre taking me off some of my meds bc of weight gain. And they want to keep me on such a low dose of risperidone if it was bipolar it could come back. I’m switching psychiatrists bc I now believe I was misdiagnosed. 

I haven’t had any symptoms for 2 years of taking risperidone. I’ve been on an extremely low dose now for 2 weeks and no symptoms. The stress in my life is manageable & I don’t have constant ptsd triggers in this lifestyle now like I did before with my immediate family. 

Does anyone else have experience with ptsd & psychosis? Is your story in any way similar to mine? I just want a safe treatment plan. Is it bipolar or just ptsd? Thanks for reading this

1mifz67,Hope!  Hang in there everyone.,"“However, only about 20–30 percent of patients achieve full remission, which is often unsatisfactory. Our approach is fundamentally different.""
Won continued: ""While prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction has been consistently reported in PTSD, the role of GABAergic mechanisms in this dysfunction has not been fully explored.""
The researchers found that a brain-permeable drug called KDS2010, which selectively blocks an enzyme called 'monoamine oxidase B' (MAOB) responsible for this abnormal GABA production, can reverse PTSD-like symptoms in mice.
""It targets the pathological reactive astrocyte-derived GABA at the source,"" said Won.
""Unlike traditional MAO inhibitors, which can have off-target effects and are irreversible, KDS2010 is highly selective, reversible, and brain-penetrant, making it safer and more targeted.""
They report the drug has already passed Phase 1 safety trials in humans, which makes it a ""strong candidate"" for future PTSD treatments.
GABA can be a positive thing, helping to regulate motor function, sensory processing and emotional stability. It can also offer calming effects, including helping to reduce anxiety and stress by controlling overactive neurons.
""However,"" Won explained, ""GABA does not act uniformly across the brain, and its outcome varies depending on the target circuit.
""While GABA is generally calming, in this context [of the researcher's findings], it was silencing a circuit that the brain needs to overcome fear. This highlights that the effect of GABA is not simply good or bad, but it critically depends on where it acts and what neural circuits are involved.""",1754415927.0,7,5,ptsd,ptsd

1mikd5d,I had a breakthrough yesterday: I had  transference with my psychologist,"It was negative transference where I saw my psychologist as my brother, mother and dad. I had to labor over a point which is a technique my mother used to traumatise me in the first place by making me over explain everything. 

My psychologist did that by accident, and then i said: 

""Do you know what you just did?""

Then I said:

""I'm getting a lot of negative transference right now.""

My psychologist said:

""You're splitting""

Kind of, I was sort of aware and sort of dissociated and I've trained myself in a sort of partial recovery where both my amygdala and prefrontal cortex can be active at the same time.

I have had full dissociative events where I felt nothing.

This was different: 

While my psychologist represented my mother, brother and father who are all highly toxic people. I didn't get angry, I just stayed in that space. 

I said:

""I feel like I want to punch a hole in the wall right now, but I'm not going to.""

My psychologist said:

""That's OK I feel safe.""

She then got me to describe what my PTSD felt like and I said:

""It feels like poison from a deadly type of snake that can kill me in 15 minutes.""

She then asked me:

""What colour is is it?""

I said:

""It's purple, and red, and green, andd black, and every colour that could be poisonous""

She asked me a few moe questions and then I said basically ""fuck"" I'm sorry I never wanted this to happen like this. I feel angry.

Her next client didn't turn up and so I got to spend a bit more time with it, it's not easy being dissociated but I sat in it...


And then I attributed something to it I already know... 

""Western people have a problem with silence, they need to fill it with noise""

""Eastern people tolerate silence""

""I just need my zen to calm my mind, to not talk and sit in it.""

What does it tell me... I needed that moment of anger that was guided by a train professional.

1miatma,Intuition or Intrusive?,"So last year we were bringing my daughter to her school meet and greet for kindergarten. Honestly I had no business sending her to school. She wasn’t developmental ready(stage one autism). I was sending her anyways though. We ended up getting a major car wreck that resulted in a giant developmental regression and her being “homeschooled” for a year. I was terrible at home schooling btw. 

So anyways, about a week or two before the wreck on a couple occasions the thought of a wreck on the way to her meet and greet popped into my mind. I disregarded it even though I had a terrible feeling about sending her to school. 

Here we are a year a later. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I have no business homeschooling my kids. My daughter also made a lot of developmental progress this past year and I fully believe she’s ready for school now.

To make it worse, for this new school I have to drive on an interstate that I dread being on because of how dangerously people drive on it. My thoughts are very negative. Not limited to thoughts of possible death. No part of me wants to get in my car tomorrow. The thoughts are completely random too. I could be doing and thinking of something entirely unrelated and they pop up. They pop up in a calm yet kind of harsh and cold tone. For example, I was on a pregnancy test thread and mentioned how my son just turned 4 and my thought while typing was “if he continues to stay alive after tomorrow”. Like what type of thought is that. I’m losing my mind and considering not bringing my child to public school this year even though she very much needs to be there. 

I don’t know if my intuition is trying to tell me something again or if this is purely ocd and trauma related intrusive thinking.  

My post got taken down in another Reddit group cause they assumed I was looking for reinforcement in how I’m feeling. No. I want help. I want to feel okay and not crying and not to feel insane. ",1754404330.0,3,2,ptsd,ptsd
1mi2uhh,Suffered an explosion,"Hey!
Never thought i’d be posting here but here we are. I’m a 16 year old and while on a guided canoe trip in northern quebec I experienced an explosion and was badly injured.

One minute I was hanging out with two friends in a ventilated cooking tent, and the next thing I knew the gas canister 2 feet away from me exploded. I was knocked back and trapped in the collapsed tent. I had a few moments of thinking that I would die trapped and scared.

Fortunately, my caveman brain got the best of me and I flipped over to see that the tent had burned away and I was able to run out.
After ensuring the safety of the group, our guides began treating the burns on my hands and face, as well as hypothermia (shock induced). 

Due to our remote location, rescue took eight long hours. I was helicoptered out and then took a medical transport plane to the children’s hospital in my city, where I was for 3 weeks.

While I’m making a full recovery (some nasty scars aside), I keep struggling with the mental aspects. While I have daily flashbacks, they haven’t been intense or painful. However, I am now insanely hyper vigilant. 

I get incredibly anxious and enter a flight response when confronted with anything explosive/flammable (Mainly propane tanks).

I’m wondering if this is just a part of me now or if it will fade with time?

1mi6eov,Work is becoming increasingly difficult,"TW for Suicidal Thoughts. 

So I have ptsd due to a negative church experience (arguably cult experience). I moved back to my very religious hometown after the abuse, because at least it wasn't the same city the actual abuse happened in. Just more minor childhood abuse and the like. 

I adore my job as a private music teacher, but religion features heavily and it is killing me. I lost a 3rd of my student load last year because I no longer could teach at the christian private school. I had debilitating panic attacks every time I tried to drive there, and I finally decided it was unfair to the families and stopped. 

Overall I am a worse teacher. I get exhausted so easily now. My consistency has plummeted. I'm actually a better teacher at this moment for the simple reason that I don't have enough students, but I can use my limited energy to teach. 

I had raised my prices for new students (I haven't raised my prices in years because of the abuse and aftermath) and moved everyone onto it now that they can use government educational funds. But a parent is already mad at me over the admittedly massive price increase, and I genuinely had to fight suicidal thoughts over a vaguely accusatory email. 

I just am failing so much. I am in therapy. I am on meds. I am doing the things I'm supposed to do to get better, but I just end up doing worse and worse each year. I want to die. I would move, but I don't know if I could afford anywhere and I don't have the right qualifications to easily relocate. I wish my abuse wasn't so pathetic. I wish they actually killed me instead of just saying I sinned so bad it was worthy of death. I really just wish they would have obeyed God's word and killed me. ",1754392685.0,5,3,ptsd,ptsd

1mi8owp,Feelings of re-experiencing are distressing after I outed my SA’er to his brother. Any advice appreciated.,"I was groomed and SA’d by a family member. This happened 4 years ago. Since then it only hit me last year and for almost two years now I’ve been going through a rollercoaster of emotions. For the past few months now, I’ve really been feeling very settled about it. 


Even though I have intrusive memories of the person involved almost everyday, I haven’t been feeling as distressed about it as I used to. I’m able to observe the thoughts and memories and let it pass, and continue living this life that I have built for myself in the present. 


Yesterday however, the brother of the person involved messaged me to congratulate me about something and it really triggered me. I know ideally it’s not his fault and I should’ve just for my sake completely cut him off, but I didn’t think it through. I thought I was okay. 

I’ve been mainly feeling a lot of leftover anger and resentment towards the person who did that to me, that he got to walk away without any consequences. So because of the heightened emotions I was feeling yesterday, I sorta impulsively decided to tell his brother everything. His brother has always been very kind and supportive toward me and all my siblings. 

Doing that in hindsight is seeming like such a bad idea because today I’ve been dealing with feeling unsettled. Angry at myself for not being over it already. I feel disgusted in my own body, feeling like talking about it again has “contaminated” my present life. Essentially I’m feeling the same feelings that I felt when I was in that time. I’m finding it really hard to regulate. And I’m also grieving the person that I was and the life that I had before I had this conversation yesterday. I’m also feeling like the milestone that I posted about which led his brother to congratulate me has been contaminated by whats happened. 

I just want to be okay. I don’t know how to be okay at the moment. It’s been a while since I’ve discussed this with my therapist. I’m just going to try some DBT skills, but I’m open to any other suggestions and methods of thinking about this to shift my perspective. 

My intention to tell his brother was out of anger, so that my assaulter faces the consequences he deserves but maybe I should’ve really truly actually thought about it, because now everything feels so much more outside of me, like I can’t control it, and like more people know about my shame and guilt, that they’ll look at me and only be able to think of me as this person who had this happened to them. 

I’m trying my best to fight my all or nothing thinking. I just feel like I was finally in such a safe mental space and like now it’s been ripped away from me. Please help.",1754399184.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd

So i didn’t really feel like i was in life threatening danger the whole time but now every time i even feel slightly sick, hear about the pill i used (very common), or hear any of those hospital sounds i get instantly triggered.

1mhgoog,I confronted my sexual abuser this morning and called the police on him in order to seek justice.,"Good afternoon everyone. I am writing this post today because I would like some support, and to also hear about some of your opinions regarding this recent situation I have found myself in. 

So, earlier this morning I had some sort of mental breakdown, and ended up explosively confronting my entire biological family about sexual abuse I had endured from my older brother as a child. He had humiliated me, broken my confidence, and caused me a great deal of suffering throughout my life due to his strong sadistic traits. 

In recent years I had attempted to reconcile with my biological family after becoming independent and working on my trauma and bereavements with therapists and psychiatrists. I have a complicated mental health history, and had gone through my entire childhood without the asperges diagnosis that came up later on in life. My father was an alcoholic, my mother was an uneducated and poor farmer who migrated over to the United kingdom for a better life. 

My childhood was quite typical in many ways, and I have had some good memories that I cherished at home and also away and out with the neighbour boys playing soccer or cricket in local parks. Usually, at home I would distract myself with an Xbox original gaming a large amount of the fun classics. 

Our family was comprised of my father, mother, and only older brother (o.3yrs). I recall being quite oblvious to things as a young child, and would often trust the good intentioned words of other people and was often lied to. I seemed to have trusted and looked up to my older caregivers above anyone else despite being regularly mistreated by them. This led to me being a very submissive boy who was eager to make the older kids and adults around me proud. 

Seeing as my Asperges was not diagnosed until I was 15 (y.o) I had performed poorly in school without the knowledge necessary required for my educational year group and the coming exams required to advance my career in the future. In the earlier years, I had failed to learn the basics of core subjects and due to a lack of involvement with my parents, I never learnt anything in school and neither was there anybody around to monitor my achievements and mistakes in life. Around me was no single person who had taught me anything valuable or left a good influence in my youth. The greatest joys of my youth were usually the mindless adventures we had together, doing stupid but entertaining things in our time away from school. 

The activities described above are the only memorable and joyous things I recall. I will not account the abuse I endured ; details are completely unimportant. The fact is: I was sexually assaulted regularly by more than one person at home. 

Only recently this morning, did I go over to my childhood home in order to talk with and confront my mother and brother - inform them that I will be reporting my brother to the police for the sexual crimes he had committed against me when I was a teenager and young child. 

I will not describe specifics here due to the fact my case has been handed over to the sexual crimes unit of my local police. I am currently waiting for a detective to contact me so that I may undertake an extensive interview to discuss the crimes I was impacted by. 

The situation became ugly fast, and the end result was me being told to ""leave and don't come back"". My brother was silent for the majority of the interaction, as I stared directly at him and said ""why do you feel this behaviour was ever acceptable? Give me an actual reason."" In between saying stuff like this, I pointed out how my brother had only abused me due to a lack of a positive male role model in the house ; that he was deeply insecure and lacked empathy for other people. I said to my mother and brother that ""people like"" (them) ""never take responsibility for their mistakes"". I called my brother a coward for refusing to face my father in the open casket, and that he was ""all swagger, no substance"". I informed him that I could easily overpower him now that I am grown adult due to my martial arts, strength, flexibility and cardio training. He was staring down at the floor most of the time and had very little to say. When he did respond to me it was to deflect responsibility. 

Due to the heated nature of this interaction, things became pretty loud and we all started to shout. I made sure to exceed their volume when talking to make sure they could not interrupt me. My mother began to call me a disgusting pervert as I spoke aloud the exact atrocities my brother had subjected me to make it clear how depraved he is. 

Shortly after this I called the police, and my mother told me to ""leave the house and to never return"". I am pretty much alone right now, and I am suffering from a psychotic illness that may be on the schizo spectrum. I would like to know from you all, what you think about this situation, and how would you feel if you were in my shoes. 

It feels like my world has turned upside down in less than a single morning. For years I had wanted to report him but was too frightened, and now soon, detectives will be speaking with me. I will be contacting my peers from high-school to see if they can recover chats related to the abuse I described at home as a student in highschool, and use this as evidence in the case against my brother. I will also be seeking out documents from my child psychologist and social services to back up my claims regarding my brother's contact. 

I feel extremely empty, a little frightened, and also very emotionally confused. My mother was the only member of my family that I still love. She is still extremely neglectful and enables horrible behaviour such as my half brother using cocaine when he has a young kid, or my father being a daily alcoholic. She would allow the abuse to go on and actively choose to be dishonest with therapists and social services to protect my brother when she knew what truly went on. There were many things she did not witness in terms of the abuse, though whenever I complain that something is abuse she says that it is always ""just a joke"". She seriously believes that my brother pushing me down the stairs and slamming my head into a wall is a ""joke"". My brother would threaten me with violence to be his slave, and got off from having control over me and other people. 

I just hope everything works out alright. It just feels like I might faint and my hands are lightly trembling. I haven't been sleeping, drinking much fluid or eating. I am trying to take care of myself as much as possible, though I am just currently so exhausted. 

Thanks for reading

TLDR : I report my sexual abuser to the police, a detective is now on the case, I have been disowned by my mother and suffer from a disorder on the schizo spectrum which makes my life difficult. I feel anxious and stressed about the potential outcome of future legal proceedings, and make an effort to recover past evidence if possible to secure a conviction against my brother. Struggle with homicidal thoughts if he ever possibly steps free or is not convicted. Conflicted about these thoughts. ",1754321582.0,29,55,ptsd,ptsd

1mhodv6,[Need Advice] PTSD while homeless,"I (26f) won’t have many specifics about what my ptsd is about. But I need advice on how to deal with the attacks. 
I’ve been homeless for 7 months now and it’s been hard. My ptsd comes from some things that I went through as a young adult/teenager and some things I saw. Recently I’ve started having attacks where my whole body shakes and I can’t stop it. I start hyperventilating (I do work on controlling my breathing). The first time I started having flashbacks and I was crying. Complete full ptsd reliving and going through things all over again. Today I saw the person who triggered the first attack. I hid from them but I know they saw me. I was shaking and hyperventilating but not flashbacks. This person also genuinely scares me and I’m afraid for my life if he comes around because he’s an addict (no judgement from me since homelessness is rough) but I don’t understand him very well so he is extremely unpredictable to me and last I saw him he was angry and looking for me. 
Advice I’m looking for I guess is just what should I do to help calm down? All I really know is to concentrate on breathing and I don’t know what else I can do. I also move away from the situation or environment if I’m able to as well. But I’ve never really dealt with this before especially while homeless and not really having any safe space to be. I’m already pretty stressed all the time so these attacks are happening more often and they’re scary. I don’t know what to do. I’d love to hear ways to calm down. Ways to help deal with it. Or even just positive encouragement because I don’t have a community or support system. ",1754338443.0,5,4,ptsd,ptsd
1mh5r7h,So I'm living under a dictatorship,"Hi, I live in Venezuela and I've never have leaved this country before, well I'm not here to ask for money but I just wanna rant how never on the internet is never going to understand how it is (and yeah at the end of the day what's internet if not just something that if you want it could stop existing by just turning off the phone)

I think I'm kinda beyond repair, many relatives have died in violent ways, Healthcare here is non existent so if I get sick I might just die, the very few people that I've met throughout my life have escaped. They were lucky, good second nationalities or just money (I don't have any of that)

I spent the last five years doing nothing but stay all day in my bed room overthinking about how doomed me and my family are, we been through famine, some robbers emptied our house (we lost everything, old recordings of me and my sister, money and whatnot) there's isn't a day that I don't think about how bad high school was for me, and yeah I get that I should not compare myself to others, but even here in this country many people did enjoyed high school, not everyone went through bullying, famine or those robberies, I'm twenty two and I haven't done a thing with my life let a lone made a friend or something. 

I don't see the day of me actually starting to feel alive, there's no way I would heal if I stay here, there's no many people left and it is what it is, doomed by being born here, y'all try to be a bit grateful, I know it sounds plain and stuff but still.

No one put effort in friendships with me. The same people that say “I’m always here for you” ditch me when I get real deep. They realize I’m just an emotional wreck.

A hug not only shows that you care, but that you’re are comfortable around me and you get me. It reassures that you actually really care. I really yearn for that.

idk if this can help anyone but i’m a young woman who struggles with C-PTSD (mainly due to childhood trauma but not only), it truly ruins my everyday life and i got many many health issues bc of that so i wanted to share some things that helped me in case it can help anyone out there 💞💞💞
- ashwaganda !!!! (everyday, right after waking up. if needed twice a day) 
- walking/working out (depends what works for you but don’t stress your body too much!) 
- calming youtube videos during the day and/or to sleep at night (search: lower cortisol level sound bath relaxation/nervous system reset sound bath…) 
- meditation
- eft tapping (tik tok or youtube videos) 
- baths 
- if you struggle with panic attacks, you can eventually call a friend or talk to a friend by message but ask them to talk about anything BUT the panic attack you’re currently having.
- anchor !!! focus on something or someone when you’re having a panic attack (like your partner, crush… whatever) 
- art (write, draw, watch movies…) 
- sleep 
- breathe 
- for muscle tension i recommend this product: Puressentiel - Joints and Muscles - Roller with 14 Essential Oils - Relieves muscle and joint pain and aches - Back, knees, legs for athletes 75 ml
- for hair loss, no products really helped…. try to have a good balanced diet, let time heal and don’t stress about it too much cause it’s only gonna make it worse.

1mhbff1,nightmares,"hey everyone! i got diagnosed with ptsd last october from stalking and harassment that i experienced for over a year from someone i dated. one of the most telling symptoms aside from the constant fear, flashbacks, triggers, and  panic everyday lol were the constant nightmares related to the stalking.

i come from a pretty dysfunctional family. i have four brothers, two of them that grew up in our hometown with me both with violent/angry tendencies and have substance issues. one has threatened to kill me and my mom/our family whenever he’s under the influence. i didn’t get physically or sexually abused (aside from weirdo pedo interactions growing up) so i don’t have that type of trauma per se. going back home for the holidays or even just visits gets me so anxious and agitated which i know it normal for a lot of people but it gets me to a point of a full mental breakdown. 

ive had nightmares for as long as i can remember growing up. i’ve never had more than a month or so period of no nightmares at least that i can remember ever since i moved out of my hometown in 2022. i have nightmares about the stalking, violent incidents in my family, the aforementioned threats, dysfunctional dynamics, random violence, yelling, hiding, etc. i definitely am an anxious and depressed person. i’ve taken and am taking medication for both, currently just on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg and have taken setraline for PTSD anxiety which helped but i had a lot of weight gain with it so i stopped. i’m also in therapy and have been doing EMDR for the PTSD, life changing lol. 

if i go to sleep too early i will definitely be having nightmares all night. i even delay going to sleep because i know it’ll happen. it happens even if i get little sleep too but definitely if i go to bed early. i usually wake up in the middle of the night in a panic, be scared, cry, try to go back to sleep, and then can’t sleep peacefully the rest of the night. the nightmares just keep going. last night was one of those nights and i was eating breakfast with my boyfriend a bit ago and i just completely broke down in tears because my brain felt so fucking destroyed and rattled from the nightmares. 

i guess what im seeking is just general insight about all of this? especially those with CPTSD i’m curious if any of our symptoms have any crossover. i’m not asking for a diagnosis but i want to know more about it because i feel like i am realizing this is more than just anxiety. also anyone with advice about nightmares, pls lol. i keep a dream log, i reach out to my boyfriend after ive had nightmares and he holds and comforts me, i talk about them in therapy, i do EMDR, anyone have any advice or suggestions on nightmare mitigation? random things that help/don’t help? anyone with CPTSD can weigh in on this too? i can’t tell how much of it is just general anxiety and how may be teetering into CPTSD? maybe i’m wrong, but just need answers lol. i’ll definitely bring it up to my therapist too i know you guys aren’t my therapist but idk just needing some advice from my fellow traumatized folk lol 🩷",1754308700.0,3,5,ptsd,ptsd

1mh5qir,"For those who have been admitted, does anyone else miss the psych ward?","(TW: suicidal thoughts in past tense, violence).

When I was 16, I was placed into an inpatient behavioral hospital for suicidal thoughts. My stay was only 7 days, but it remains one of the most impactful moments in my life. 

I’m 19 now, so it’s been 3 years. I don’t see my psych ward stay as traumatizing by itself - I witnessed a lot of violence and fights, but I didn’t feel in danger at any point. On that note, I’m posting this in the PTSD sub since it’s usually trauma that results in people in mental hospitals and I also have PTSD anyways. 

One thing that has weirdly stuck to me is how the psych ward felt like home. The psych ward me felt like /me/. I felt alive in that time. I felt like I was truly myself, the most authentic version of me I was. 

I find myself constantly wishing I was back, even though I’m not suicidal. Of course I wish I was back even more when I am. 

I guess I wonder why, and if it is related to trauma. Do I crave the attention I got when I was in the hospital? Do I crave the connection to other people going through the same thing?

I feel like I relished in the attention of other people caring about my problems because that meant my problems were important and meaningful. I relished in the fact my family was concerned for me, because it was the only time they had ever shown care for my mental health. I relished in being treated like I was “sick” because I WAS sick, and I was finally getting help. 

I’m in therapy now as well as on antidepressants. I’m making big lifestyle changes. I’m trying to live every day to the fullest. While I’m not usually suicidal anymore, I still find myself craving how I felt at the pysch ward.

1mhgxs4,PTSD and cutting off communication,"Hi everyone,

I’m engaged to a wonderful man who’s a veteran with severe PTSD. We’ve been together for almost four years. His trauma goes deep, and I’ve always tried to be patient, loving, and present.

Last year, after some very intense and triggering events, he disappeared after an argument. Completely cut contact, no messages, no replies. That had never happened before. It was a complete and utter shock to me. cutting of communication unfortunately, is a big trigger for me. After three months of silence, I drove down to him (we live a few hours apart). To my surprise, he was genuinely relieved to see me. We talked things through, and he told me he would let me know if things got too heavy again.

Things went well for a while. But recently, stress built up again: work pressure, and the loss of a beloved dog. I felt him withdrawing, and now it’s been nearly four weeks of total silence again.

This time, I’m not doing well either. I hit a low point and called his mailbox drunk one night, letting out some of my own frustration and pain. Then I wrote an email calm, kind, trying to show understanding while sharing a bit of what this does to me. I said I’d wait.

But I’m also falling apart.  
I have my own struggles, and I don’t know how long I can keep holding space for someone who disappears like this. I know he needs help, but I don't think he's getting the help HE needs.

I don’t want to leave.  
But I don’t know how to stay.  
There’s even some legal stuff we need to solve soon, and I feel stuck and helpless. He knows this but it doesn't seem to reach him.

I don’t want to shame him. I don’t want to force anything.  
But I’m so lost right now.  
Would it be wrong to ask him to meet up somewhere, just for a neutral check-in? Or is that just another pressure point?

I really don't know what to do.

1mhfucv,Is it anxiety or PTSD.,"Let me start this by saying I've had anxiety all my life. But in the last year its escalated to new heights. I don't know if what I'm feeling is normal anxiety or PTSD. 

I'm obsessed to the point of not sleeping with the concept of my cats getting sick / dying. My older lady has been drinking more water as of late, same thing last year, and despite her bloods in October being fine, I'm terrified she's dying or getting sick. She's going back for another full old lady check tomorrow (which is fine, it's almost a year since her last bloods) despite no other things wrong but her drinking water more often. 

I was worried last year. BUT then in November our youngest cat was diagnosed with a horrible large cell lymphoma which set off a trail of terrible events that had me almost unable to function. It was truly terrible. I'll never forget the phone call, her surgery, the way work treated us because she was 'just a cat.' She's our baby and we damn near lost her. I can't even look at photos of her leading up to or during that time. 

Just talking about it now my head feels light, my stomach is in knots. I can't even watch shows or listen to music that we were into at that time. 

But I don't know if this is warrant enough to call it PTSD. Or am I just so so overly anxious to the point of making myself physically unwell? 

Anyway. Sorry for the rant. My husband is sick of me, I know he is. I've already had to take off work for a week at the beginning of July because I just can't cope (more than just the cats are causing my head to go into over drive, they are just an example) I'm at the point now where I'm actively thinking of seeking professional help other than the meds I'm already on.

I'm struggling with still being a youngish adult and attempting to figure out what our new parent-child dynamic is now that I'm an adult whilst also navigating this. They have struggled with maintaining romantic and platonic relationships previously. The biggest issue seems to be that they now believe that the next part of the healing journey is to discuss the incident with me but I don't feel that they are able to communicate this in a safe way yet (censor what needs to be censored). I also don't know if I'm prepared or qualified to have that conversation. I am also neurodivergent so I am (correct me if I'm wrong) more 'at risk' of developing PTSD symptoms whether through my own experiences or through second hand trauma.

It also isn't the feeling that is the issue, I understand that I am not responsible for the way he feels, but he says hurtful things and just reacts. I need any information or resources I can find.

When I had my asd assessment last Oct. The psych told me that hes 60% sure Im adhd aswell. But with my very bad upbringing of family violence and very triggering things. Its hard to tell if my symptoms are adhd or cptsd.
Only real way to tell is to do a trial on ADHD meds and if impoved. Great adhd confirmed. 
There is a huge chance Ive got both. 

Anyway- those that have both. Have you noticed adhd sympathy worsen with stress?

Few wks ago my aunt thats been a user for ages of stuff if you get me. Started calling me. She brings up nearly every day family drama. Things that Ive finally gotten over. I thought but now it's brought up again and again. It's all not doing to good mentally. She says her long term use caused epilepsy and she now has a bad memory and forgets she told me. I believe this because she will tell me things like it's the first time she's ever told me. I am questioning if she's 100% clean though. She brings up things about her brother and what he did to me. Her mum (nan) and the stuff that just I felt like I was doing so well with since going full non contact 18mths ago Ive been doing great honestly. What my mums side of the family did to me was hell. My dads gf also was horrid. But mums side. They should not be here. They are severely horrid people.

I dont even have a counsellor as she changed jobs and put me on a wait list and thought I was doing great. 

But this... ive notice thing like my brain won't calm down. I cant sit still. I cant go to bed knowing the loungeroom is half rearranged. I cant sit still knowing the bedroom isnt clean. I cant stop my brain. And its getting very difficult on me. I tried to sit and watch a show I loved and then started rearranging the house. It got more messier Than before and so difficult. Bruises from moving furniture alone etc. 

I try talk something that Im stressing over and my works come out in wrong order and I have to stop and breathe and have a break. Rethink my words and try again. And sometimes I just give tm up trying to talk as they just aren't coming out right. 

I cant calm my brain down lately. Im exhausted and ended up feeling scuicidal. I went to a dr and asked for a refill of valium. I dont use them often but when im bad like this. I need it. He said that he needs me to go to a hosptial for help and I refused as its a $140 and last time for mental health they just gave me hotline numbers and sent me home. And the gp said Im obviously not scuicidal enough to be worried about money. I left. 

I did call mental health triage and he got me to write down some info and see another gp i started seeing (my main gp of 10yrs got fired). Hes given me a referral to get an adhd proper one done. Focused on just that. And focus on trialling meds.

So my question is-

Those with ptsd/cptsd aswell as adhd. Do you find your adhd symptoms worsen with ptsd triggers? 
Im just questioning if this could still be both or this is pointing towards more cptsd like the first psych said could be. 

Those medicated with adhd. How fast does it help? Some anti depressants take weeks etc. If I requested a trial of like 2 weeks. Should that be enough to see improvement if it is adhd. If not I can stop it. 

Im stressing tbh. Just cant sit still atm and struggling abit more than usual.",1754287254.0,2,3,ptsd,ptsd

Hello everyone, I hope you are well today. Im reaching out as I feel kind of hopeless in finding resolution from the suffering. Please read on and if you have anecdotes, articles, or other resources please offer them in the comments. 

I have been really struggling with an extreme event that occurred a week ago. I work at a restaurant/bar in a busy part of town. Weekends are a wild scene. That weekend in particular was a huge event basically bringing the whole city down to our block for festivities. Store was jumping all weekend. Stressful and high intensity, tough but nothing that can't be handled. Saturday night as were closing up around 130 in the morning, im chatting with the manager who is a very close friend. I look at this person as if they were family. As we are mid-conversation she goes blank. Dead staring over my shoulder, I look back to see what's caught her eye and there's nothing there. I look back to her and see shes frozen locked into nothing. I start asking her if shes okay to no responce. This was quickly followed by her collapsing and beginning to seize as im grabbing her arms and trying to collect her from falling completely backwards. Now on the ground shes still unresponsive, eyes rolling back, whole upper body was seizing. I rolled her to her side as she began foaming and bleeding from the mouth with more seizing. all the while trying to bring her back by rubbing her back and speaking with her calmly. This all occurred very quickly, and in a postion in which others could not see us. I screamed at least 5 times for someone to call 911 before anyone responded. The seizure maybe lasted 5 minutes and once she regained her initial consciousness she so fearfully screamed at the top of her lungs, not words just screams of fear. After that she was a relatively normal level of consciousness, didnt know what happened but she could speak. Shes okay now. I only spoke with her briefly since then but shes doing a lot better now. I however am not. This event seems to have flipped a switch in my brain and now I feel completely off my rocker. The day following her seizure I was still really messed up. Made the poor choice to cope with alcohol. Ended up completely wasted and still feeling just as confused and upset as the day before. I feel completely uncorked. I've lost all emotional regulation. I am a brave and courageous person, but since then my fight or flight has been switched completed to flight. Shutting down even. My girlfriend and I were together two days after it happened and a wasp flew near her. She understandably reacted as most do, and the way she tensed up/made a face in the 1 second this occurred my body and mind started racing. My heart was beating out of my chest, felt like a panic attack. I thought she too was now having a seizure, the worst part is when I saw it happening i couldn't do anything I just had to stop. I saw her, thought she was seizing, and unlike with my manager whom I jumped in to help in anyway I felt I couldn't do anything at all to help my girlfriend. 

I tried to condense the details in a form that is conveinent to read and reflect on. I have much more to share on the topic if someone wants more details. 

To conclude i do feel guilty feeling so bad about this. So many people go though so much and also so much worse than me. I know feeling guilty is kind a part of this but I just dont know where to turn right at this moment. Both my gf and I recognize the guilt really dragging me through this. If there's also anything in particular about that you have to add it would be most welcome.

1mgz4i7,SA from childhood,"TW: childhood SA

Hey everyone, it’s my first time posting here, and I want to ask for help and also vent. When I was about 6 to 9 years old, a family member who was much older than me (8 yrs older) pressured me into doing intimate acts with him and my cousin (same age as me, also was sa from this) on different occasions and promised me rewards like playing games or getting what I wanted. I never really learned about boundaries or what’s okay and not okay growing up, and I had no sexual education at all, so it’s hard for me to make sense of why I went along with it.
I also don’t remember a lot of my childhood and I barely remember the memories of me getting sa. Sometimes I wonder if the person who did this to me might have had similar experiences growing up, which could explain why they thought it was okay. But I am the same age right now as they were when they were doing these acts to me and I would NEVER look at a 6 yr old like he did. I would also never force anyone to do things with me in return for something else.  I’m not asking for pity, I am just trying to understand why people do this and how I can start to heal from these confusing memories, and how I could fill in the blanks in these memories. Thank y’all in advance for any advice.

I was intimate with my longtime partner for the first time recently and it was a positive experience — not one I feel is essential to our relationship (& she agrees) but I enjoy intimacy simply as a way to be close to another person, and my partner makes me feel really comfortable. But despite the experience itself being positive, the fallout has been brutal. I wasn't sure what it was at first, but upon some introspection I think I'm having a trauma response. 

Every time I think about it I feel nauseous. The idea of self pleasure in particular is making me incredibly uncomfortable, which is really confusing because a lot of online resources recommend masturbation as a way to feel more comfortable with one's own sexuality. At the risk of sounding incredibly immature it just seems really gross to me. I know guilt is normal with sexual trauma but the mental block is so bad that it's effecting my perceptions of the people around me which just feels awful — like ""oh, they must masturbate, that's so gross."" It feels so ridiculous and I want to get better, I'm just scared. I don't even want to engage with the thought.

Has anyone else experienced this? What helps you?",1754263360.0,4,6,ptsd,ptsd
1mgxmdv,Am I gonna make it?,"I was sucker punched and knocked out last year which made me lose my front tooth. This was then recorded and sent round my college/university which led to people making fun of me wherever I went. This then got generalised to everyday situations where I thought people were making fun of me or talking about me. I’ve spent a whole year locked away in my room on the verge of suicide. I’m now back in my home country (a small country where everyone knows everyone and now people know what’s wrong with me). I’m working as a waiter, doing boxing and trying to finish my uni work so I don’t have to repeat the year. I’m on day 7 of work and every member of staff, even the older ones where all making fun of me (no this isn’t my anxiety they genuinely were making fun of me). I wanna keep going but idk if this is gonna work, am I really gonna feel better if I just keep showing up even when everyone is making fun of me? Won’t that just fuel my anxious beliefs and make me stay stuck like this forever? I’m at my wits end because I was extremely extroverted, popular and liked by loads of people before this happened and now I’m their fucking punchline. Should I keep going?

I just feel like he doesn't appreciate the things that have been done to me. He shows far more sympathy to her (I guess since he has known her longer) but because I am dissociated from my emotions (I put them aside and dont experience them) and dont show them, he just gives her more sympathy even though she abused and neglected me. I feel like the last sane guy in the world. Thing is, she doesn't even do anything half the time, she just sits around.

I pride myself with my progress and with how far I've come, never thought i would get past 20 so everything is so exciting to me. The hardest part it's still to get people remaining from my past to respect my boundaries and sometimes I get so bad from the way they trample all over the work I did just out of pure ignorance. Yesterday I had the worst panic attack in years, I couldn't catch my breath, I was crying, feeling like I was burning and today I was so out of myself I could barely function, I could not get anything done and just had another panic attack at a parking lot.

I don't like feeling like I go back to a bad place, I hated therapy just because I would get so frustrated with how long it took and now I feel like I'm all the way back. I really just wish people could respect boundaries.",1754263753.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd
1mgx5j0,Reasonable Accommodation Request,"Hello! I am a mental health provider, and I have ADHD. I have been working a patient who is a Veteran (history of PTSD w/ military and personal trauma, and ADHD). He holds a federal job and recently, his supervisor and directors indicated that ALL staff will be required to return to FT on-site work for the first time since he began working there 1.5 years ago. The job was presented as a WFH and telecommuting job, requiring only a weekly trip to the nearest facility. However, he’s less productive at work than at home due to frequent casual interactions that trigger his personal trauma reminders. These reminders lead to avoidance behaviors, mood and memory alterations, irritability, detachment from others, and poor focus and concentration (compounded by his pre-existing ADHD). When all workers are recalled to the site simultaneously, he’s often asked about his family, which is the trigger. I won’t disclose his personal trauma, but it’s related to his family and involves the tragic loss of multiple children. As a mental health provider with nearly 20 years of experience, I believe this incident is the most gruesome and disturbing acute personal trauma I’ve ever encountered. I expect he’ll have some degree of impairment for the rest of his life. Initially, the incident caused a psychotic break, suicide attempt, and psychiatric hospitalization.

My patient understands that an appropriate RA will never be a “stress free environment,” but we have discussed articulating his request in the form of needing to work in a “controlled work setting (eg, continue to WFH). I thought both the PTSD and ADHD community on Reddit might have useful suggestions, thoughts, and recommendations on how to best frame his RA request.

Three years ago me and my great grandfather were in a severe car accident, one that ended up claiming his life.

Beyond the trauma and PTSD I now have with cars, I cannot for the life of me get over the guilt that he had to be the one to pass...

I blame myself for the accident in general...if I didn't go out that day with him, maybe thing's would've been different...or if. I didn't leave the house the night the internal bleeding finally got to him...maybe there would've been something, anything I could have done to stop his death from happening.

I don't really...know what to do because I can't talk to anyone in my family about this, it's to heavy, to raw to deep and painful. I've talked to my therapist about it but it's always the same, ""he wouldn't want you to blame yourself."" And I get that, I do...

But god I just can't let it go...

It's always with me, always there, even on good days it's always right around the corner and it takes nothing for it to start eating me up again.

I just don't understand any of it. I don't know how to let it go or how to even begin to forgive myself.

I dunno. This is the only place I feel like i can come to to talk about everything and to ask for advice from people who may understand it better.

1mgyhyr,"Courage to Connect: Virtual Zoom Meetings for Veterans Navigating PTSD is Monday, August 4 at 7:00 PM CST.","🇺🇸 ZOOM ID: 861-1519-2209

The Courage to Connect: PTSD virtual Zoom meetings for veterans has been designed to create a safe, supportive, and confidential space. Here's how the meetings will follow these guidelines:

Confidentiality - These virtual PTSD meetings will prioritize confidentiality to create a trusting environment. Participants can feel secure knowing that anything discussed within the meeting stays within the meeting.

No Recording Policy - There will be no recordings of the meetings to ensure that everything shared remains private and secure. This aligns with our commitment to protect the privacy of participants.

Anonymity - Participants will be encouraged to use first names only or remain anonymous in any way they feel comfortable. Video is optional but encouraged. This helps foster an atmosphere where people can share openly without fear of judgment or exposure.

No Registration Required - There is no need for advanced registration to attend these meetings. We follow the ""open-door"" policy, where anyone who feels the need to attend can simply show up without prior commitment. This makes the meetings more accessible to veterans who might be seeking support but don’t want to commit to formal registration.

Peer Support and Shared Experiences - Meetings are led by a licensed professional counselor (LPC) and veterans who understand the struggles and challenges associated with PTSD. This shared understanding fosters empathy and mutual support.

Open and Non-judgmental Atmosphere - Meetings focus on shared experiences and support rather than formal therapy or treatment. This ensures that participants can share their experiences without feeling evaluated. Meetings will be open to all veterans regardless of their background or severity of PTSD. Everyone's experience is valid, and there will be no judgments or expectations—participants are free to share only what they are comfortable with.

Focus on Support, Not Treatment - While these meetings provide emotional and moral support, they will not serve as a substitute for clinical treatment or therapy. The goal is to create a space where veterans can speak openly about their PTSD, hear from others who understand their struggles, and offer encouragement and solidarity.

Structure of the Meetings - These virtual meetings will follow a structure where each session includes time for participants to share their experiences, feelings, and coping strategies. There may be an opening statement or guidelines, followed by a chance for each participant to speak if they choose. The meetings will also allow space for informal interaction and support outside of the formal speaking time, encouraging peer-to-peer connections.

ZOOM - The Zoom platform is used for these meetings allowing the veteran to join the meeting from anywhere as long as they have access to the Wi-Fi and Zoom. Video is encouraged, but not required.

By adhering to these principles, the PTSD virtual Zoom meetings will aim to create a safe, supportive, and anonymous environment for veterans to share their challenges, find comfort, and connect with others who understand their journey.

1mghsd0,My Mental Health Journey,"Good morning Reddit! I don't know what has compelled me to write this all out, as well a share it publicly, but here I am. I just wish for your grace and understanding.

Trigger warning for talks of suicide.  
A year ago I had finally had enough of this life and thought it was absolutely not worth sticking around anymore. I felt useless, powerless and completely out of sync with my mind, body and soul. I had forced myself into two full time jobs and 1 part time position to just distract my mind from it all. There were countless days that I would fight with every ounce of my being to avoid being stagnant. As that is when my thoughts would continually race. But even when I had to relax for sleep, I was plagued by constant nightmares/terrors. I felt unsafe in all aspects of my life. I mean, if I can't even trust my brain to fall asleep, how am I going to get out of this? It had gotten so bad that I started to hallucinate during the day. Then those hallucinations turned from blips in my peripheral vision to full blown people right in front of me. This forced me into an ideology that I was too far gone and ""officially crazy"". I then quickly turned to self isolation and withdrawals from all social interactions. My wife had absolutely no idea what was going on, I always kept it from her. Even though I feel like she could feel it through my states of mania and irritability.

That led me to July 28th, 2024. I finally had enough, I toyed around with the active idea of suicide for about a month at this point. I stopped going to work regularly, the stress had gotten me, I was a husk at home. My wife and children could tell, but I adamantly believed this would be the best decision for myself and them. That night after everyone went to bed, I was gonna take a walk down the alley and blow my brains out so that I could at least spare them from being the ones that found me.

Then through some absolute coincidence, divine intervention, or my wife having enough of seeing me like this. She sat me down that afternoon and wouldn't leave my side until I got some of it out to her. Once I finally opened up, even just the slightest, she quickly knew this was serious and recommended I go to the closest ER. I reported to the ER in tears and told them what was going on. (I live in a rural area and had to wait \~45 minutes for a mental health professional to arrive and assess.) They recommended an inpatient stay at our local facility. I still thought I knew better and fought back fiercely about a forced inpatient stay. (Hindsight has shown me that this is foolish and I should have just went) We argued and ultimately I signed an AMA and they gave me enough medicine to calm a raging elephant until I could be accepted into an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) rather than inpatient. My wife made sure I took this medicine until 2 days later I was accepted into this program. I attended this program for the next 6 weeks instead of going to work. (I am so thankful that my positions understood what was going on when I told them & held my jobs open for me while I got better)

I remember that first day of treatment like yesterday. I was on guard, pissed off, and disappointed in myself. I kept with my same ideology that I was too far gone and had an overall pessimistic view of the whole process. But then we had an open group discussion and an Air Force PJ vet opened up and described a lot of symptoms, thoughts and experiences that I felt related directly to me; and for some reason in that moment, I thought, maybe I'm not as alone as I think? From that moment, I decided to actually apply myself as best as I could to my treatment. More so than I have invested into my careers over the past few years. There were multiple exercises that we did and learned about during this program, of which these ones stuck out and are embedded into my brain.

Creating and updating an ""I Love Me"" binder. I will fill this thing up till the day I move on from Earth. Pictures from my kids, letters of appreciation from my community and constituents for work completed. Military awards and all sorts of things that just make me feel grounded and proud.

Fully understanding how to articulate a proper ""I Feel"" statement. This has been instrumental in how I navigate difficult conversations with people and difficult times when trying to discuss with my wife.

Overcoming the stigma that men can't be emotionally available and vulnerable. Being emotionally connected and ""in-tune"" has also opened doors in my professional life that I never would have imagined.

I continued to utilize these tools, and follow on individual counselling to slowly take back control of my life. I had been miserable and finally felt strength and empowerment in regards to my overall well-being. I started to reconnect with my wife, my kids and my community. Unbeknownst to me, 2 months prior to my hospital visit, my bosses had put me in for a prestigious State-Level award. I found out 3 weeks after graduation of the program I had been selected out of 400+ submissions to be honored at the Capitol of my state. I dropped to my knees and felt like this was my reward for having chose to live. I have not taken this chance for granted. Since then and I have developed multiple outreach initiatives for my fellow brothers and sisters at arms in my area to ensure they don't feel how I felt last year.

To be honest, I'm not sure what enticed me to write my story out for all of reddit/Internet to read. Might be part of my continued healing journey. But I hope that at least one person who reads this finds inspiration that it can always get better. That YOU matter in this world. That I believe in you and your abilities to overcome whatever stands in your way, or whatever you are struggling with. You are loved and I have faith in you all. Thank you for your time.

1mgjo85,Questioning PTSD,"CW: 🦟
CW/TW: questioning PTSD + story with insects. 
Brief mentions of vomiting, self-harm urges. Also caps in some places.
I'm not asking for a diagnosis obviously, I just need to know what others think about it, if this sounds like PTSD or something else. It's also a throw away acc.
A mosquito “attack” at 4:16am prompted me to ask ChatGPT (pls no judging, I have no one else who I can ask without being judged or dismissed) about entomophobia and if there was a specific name for fearing mosquitoes.
“[...] I know that nothing serious is gonna happen, plus it's just 1 mosquito, we have been through that before and it's not a hot country where the whole ass family would wake up and hunt mosquitoes, and we won't sleep till every one of them gets killed. I can't take any sound that's even remotely similar to a mosquito not seriously. Like I immediately think that it's a mosquito. It even includes electronic buzz.”
He said no, there's no name for fearing mosquitoes, and then it pulls out a “Possibly even a PTSD-adjacent response, if you’ve had repeated bad experiences with mosquitoes (e.g. constant bites, stress during summers, disrupted sleep, growing up in a household where they were a big deal)” card.
I was rightly flabbergasted and thought that he was just overreacting as usual. I lightheartedly dismissed it and started answering his questions.
“[...] But you're on point with constant bites, stress during summers and disrupted sleep. But I'm not too sure about the “growing up in a household where they were a big deal” part. Like yes, when we're abroad, we'd make extra sure that we all got repellent, ointments and so on. But at home? “Oh, it's just a mosquito, it's not like it's gonna eat you.” Like????? Hello???? >THAT'S THE SAME INSECT WE WERE SO ADAMANT ON KILLING ON VACATIONS!!!< The only way they're different is that they're at a summer cottage… and maybe the species of it, but I'm not too sure. We've been to Egypt 3 times, to Turkey 2 times, once to Greece and Thailand… every single time it was the same. But for some reason we don't care about the ones from our country.
The constant bites were also pain… it was to the point that I wanted to >get a knife and cut the bite place<, because I hated the itching so fucking much, I was ready to do ANYTHING to alleviate it. Never did that, but I had urges.
And I hate summer because of them.
So, I'm ok with being bitten, just please don't buzz around me for 2 hours to just never pick a spot, and please just don't itch. The disease is the least of my concerns tho.
I don't think I have anything in particular regarding memories. It's all a big mush of us in hotels at night trying to kill them on a ceiling, and waking up from hearing a nearby flying mosquito with a beating heart, saying ""mosquito!"" to others, getting in position to listen and kill them. It was 6 years ago and I still feel like this. It feels like it's getting worse every year.
And I notice that mainly with mosquitoes. Ticks are 50/50 cuz I don't contact them, I never even saw them upclose tbh. Other bugs are fine.”
“I wonder what would qualify as PTSD tho. Imagine having PTSD cuz of an insect, couldn't be me… Maybe. But I did just wake up again because I heard it. I was falling asleep and then I fucking heard it. Now no sleep in both eyes yet again, as if I never wanted to sleep in the first place.
Also about the mosquito net—mother fuckers that I now live with (I moved) don't have a net, and for whatever reason they don't hurry to get it, so now almost every night we get 1-2 mosquitoes flying in. I want to fucking disappear. He's the reason why I'm talking to you at 5 am. He's a great man, but I fucking hate him for that so much.”
I think it was starting to change his mind and was suggesting that it might qualify as PTSD.
“At this point I just wanna rant, cuz bro, it's almost 6am already 💔. I wanted to tell you in the morning how I also can get not triggered but get slightly suspicious from my own BREATHING. If my nose is just slightly clogged in the way that it produces something akin to a high-pitched sound I can wake up. But now I'm awake again because I heard a mosquito. I was trying to fall asleep, then I heard it and immediately woke up, heart beating, wide alert, sweat… not pouring, but it's there. The sun is rising bro, I can see the clear light blue sky. Is this what PTSD feels like??? I'm in hell.”
Then at 10am I tried to stand up from the bed I almost >threw up a little<. I never had that happen before. Still couldn’t sleep because some outside noises remind me of this specific or similar buzz. I got triggered by a BIRD even.",1754228808.0,0,1,ptsd,ptsd

So I'm frustrated with myself because I still can't manage to drum up an appetite, it's non-existent. I had the idea to get absolutely baked tonight to see if that would help stimulate an appetite; this idea was sparked because I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and it occurred to me how scary i look right now (edit: it also didn't work). 

So I checked my scale and realized I've lost roughly 15 pounds since the event (i typically weigh myself once a week to make sure im on track with my exercising), and all I had gotten around to eating that day was a granola bar so it barely even counts. I've been making it by on protein shakes, but seeing my actual body flipped me out because of how bad it really is.

1mfz14o,EMDR- changed my memory. Is this normal?,"During my most recent EMDR session, something really unexpected happened. As we processed a memory involving my abusive ex-husband, my mind seemed to rewrite the experience.

Instead of freezing like I did in real life, I was fighting back. I was yelling, standing up for myself, and saying all the things I never had the courage or power to say back then.

In reality, I never stood up to him. He was extremely verbally abusive, and I mostly shut down. But during this session, every time I revisited a moment, I immediately launched into defending myself.

It felt intense, surreal… and honestly, a little “crazy.” Has anyone else experienced something like this during EMDR? Is this kind of memory shift normal?

I’m 17 will be dead in about a year and honestly it’s fucking pain I’ve been suspected of having ptsd before because of all the flashbacks and nightmares that fucked with me but last year it’s like something broke in me

 I don’t live by my own will I go through life everyday miserable waiting for the day to be over and all while remembering everything I’ve been through a lot of shit in my life 

to put my life into a comedic perspective I’m like a teenage girls damaged oc that they give the most tragic lore ever lol if I told my whole story not only would that trigger the flashbacks more 

honestly my life would feel less real I’ve been slowly breaking each day I have to deal with flashbacks and just my normal depressed days two nights ago I had a really bad flashback sometimes I’ve had these flashbacks where it’s stuff I dont remember and then something triggers multiple memories flooding at once without being able to stop like I’m reliving it and honestly it’s breaking me

I wonder a bit if it’s the new meds I started but I’ve been suicidal like crazy and I’ve started cutting myself more it sucks I have to be a thigh cutter when I’m dying to cut wrist but my parents would know 

I realize now while writing this I lost part of the point I was trying to make honestly I’ve been struggling a lot I’m stuck in a world where everyone is telling me to forget and move on but I can’t do anything but remember and not move on

I’ve already considered why my providers were mentioning PTSD, but the Complex distinction isn’t in the DSM-V, so I wasn’t sure if going through an evaluation would be worth it. But now I am convinced that if I did receive an evaluation, the Complex distinction would be negligible and I’d receive a PTSD diagnosis.

It's been almost 8 years and it doesn't get better.,"I went through an experience in 2018 involving a certain internet hoax that shall not be named (if you know what I'm talking about please don't type her name) and ever since then I've been experiencing what I'm pretty sure is PTSD. I'm not looking to diagnose, just get help/advice if possible. Some background, I have complete aphantasia, meaning when I close my eyes all I see is black. I can still imagine things, but j can't see them. Anyway, the main trigger for this is seeing her face and hearing her name and more recently seeing her name. Her face will cause panic attacks and a lack of sleep. The sleep being because if my eyes are closed and I happen to think about it (quite often) I'll imagine her face. Luckily, my brain has the sense to protect me in that situation and I forget what her face looks like every time, but it's still scary as crap. If the unfortunate yet inevitable event occurs when I see her face, I can't even blink without seeing\* it. This normally lasts a few minutes to an hour, but a couple days ago it lasted several days. A perfect image of her face haunted me.

 

I have a feeling it's just gonna get worse. This has been happening for 8 years almost and it's not improving. What makes it even more baffling is that this particular character didn't just come about for the event. A year prior I was making funny stories with her as a side character. Now I can't even hear her name without shaking. Even writing this is making me tremble a little.

I’m going to have a therapy RANT. 

It feels like I’m chasing him for support. 

He can’t stick to appointment times, he’s always late. He’s always taking notes, which means at least 30 minutes of the session I’m sat in silence waiting for him. He’s giving me the old “the likelihood of it happening again when you go outside is unlikely.” Yes, I know that it’s probably unlikely, but I can’t take your word for it, when you didn’t experience what I did. You don’t know anymore than I do. He’s feeding me things I should believe which is almost manipulative. We have sessions on Tuesday 11AM, last week he changed it to 3:00PM without telling me. He called at 3:38PM. I was in the waiting room for 11 minutes before I left. He said, “I could see you in the waiting room with your camera on”. Then why not tell me that you’ve changed the time, did he really think I was willing to sit in that virtual waiting room for 5 hours? 

Last week he said this, which sounds beyond fucking stupid to me. 

“I think that if you experienced another mugging, it would re-wire your brain & would desensitise you”. Is he a fucking idiot, it would fuck me up, even more than my body and brain already is. 

The first homework was to re-read my trauma. It really really hurt. I’m on session 4 & we’ve only just started talking??

1mfvcvg,Constant Nightmare,"Disclaimer (My diagnosis is PTSD, ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety.)
I was 11 years old when I watched my father murder my mother infront of me. He only served 16 years for murder and child abuse. He is a Meth Addict. He was never there in my life. When I was born my mother gave me up to her parents (my maternal grandparents) from 0 to 8 I lived with them. I lived with them until my mother came back into my life to try and reconnect. So as a child growing up without knowing that mom experience i jumped into it excited. I lived with my mother alone for 2 years until my father got out of prison for charges related to methamphetamine manufacturing. Only was around him and her for 1 year before he decided to take her life and have me watch it. During those years with my mother was incredible she took me to multiple different fun and exciting places as well as was super involved and supportive in everything I wanted to do. It was all amazing the feeling of rekindling a relationship that I felt was missing my entire life. To this day I can remember the Smells, Sounds, how cold it felt that night, and overall every single detail perfectly. I had to relive the experience in court, retelling the story every single time. Retelling it to every person that asks. I describe it all the way in the details in remember. After that I was so depressed and awful I didn't leave my room. I had a teacher come to my house for my 6th grade year. She came to still teach me. Integrating back into public school was absolutely horrendous and torturous. When I was with my mother I was diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety already. I was medicated and it helped me during school. After she passed I went back to my maternal grandparents. They took me off medication for failure to believe in it. I went from a B average to Fs through 7th-12th grade. I had to go to almost every summer school and only graduated because the school system shoved me with the rest of the delinquents or other kids who can't handle regular school. During this i was basically given every answer to all questions anytime. I got my diploma I feel falsely.  Failed to mention during the times from 7th grade to 11th. I was bullied relentlessly for my weight, my mental health. I even had kids make fun of my trauma. I had a fake Facebook made where the birthday was my mother's day of death, I was asked horrific questions like did I see her brains etc. Things that would instantly snap me back to that moment thinking did I see that and maybe my memory blocked it out. It made me extremely suicidal. Ive been struggling even now through my adult life. I am trying to get medicated but when I mention what worked before I just get something different try it and it doesn't work cycle repeats. Ive tried therapy and get told I seem to have a great understanding and good coping. I then ask why am i here then? Also to make it worse i didn't have any true friends growing up. If i wanted to go to a friend's house (when i was living with my maternal grandparents) id get told that maybe their parents would take me away or molest me etc and that I cant tell my friend that but to just say no to them. I was entirely overly sheltered. So I grew up with 0 social skills and no friends in sight. Fail through the cracks if the education system. Any dream I had of what I wanted to be or do for a career was all shot down. I have been told that its not a real career or a real job. I need a real one. Ive given up all my dreams and goals.

He was never charged and the cut off time for making a report ends after so many years ya know, but i live in a completely different country now and thankfully will never see him again.

Certain foods i cant eat, i get anxious around silver cars, i have to sleep with minimal light and as much noise as possible (more dark = cant see anybody and more noise = less chance for me to hear something that will make me paranoid)

But its all starting to make sense, i figured i was just a sensitive person that was a ""snowflake"", my lovely father instilled into me that men don't cry, ""men put on their big girl panties"" and do what needs to be done as people make the earth spin, also the same man from 11-17 would beat me and verbally abuse me to the point i was almost hospitalized, and i love the quote from the movie of the guy who made the hot Cheetos ""I hear you're voice beating my brain everyday, and for some reason that's the beating i cant get up from""

My doc wants me to see a therapist but I'm afraid they wont believe me or they will label me as crazy or an over active imagination as a child, i know what happened to me and i wont let anyone tell me different.

I should also mention i am medicated for insomnia and generalized anxiety (trazadone and Lexapro)

1mfwn1k,How to overcome feelings of shame and PTSD from sexual coercion and complex relationship trauma from 4 years ago,"Hi everyone,

To preface, I (24F) am in therapy (EMDR) and have been going for about a year, but I feel really stuck with feelings of trauma, flashbacks, nightmares, and chest tightness. I recently got married two months ago to my wonderful husband, but have so much guilt from past relationship trauma. 

I’ve been trying to work through some deeply painful memories and guilt related to past relationships that still haunt me. One area where my PTSD symptoms show up most intensely is in the way I process my sexual and emotional past — especially two key relationships with people I’ll call Ethan and Charlie.

Ethan was my boyfriend when I was in college (18-21). We met online during Covid, and he was from Europe. We got to know each other online for a year before I was accepted to a study abroad program in his home country for a semester. I deliberately applied to this program to be in the same country for our relationship. When I moved for that semester, I didn’t know anyone and quickly made me feel isolated. All of a sudden, Ethan become emotionally distant, often left me alone, and I later discovered he was messaging other women online behind my back. I often paid for everything (groceries, plane tickets, gifts). I felt abandoned and unimportant, but he always told me he was doing nothing wrong and I expected too much. At the time, I still desperately craved his approval and presence, even though I knew deep down something wasn’t right. He was about three years older than me and was my first serious relationship. 

During that relationship and semester abroad, I became friends with a man (who we will call Charlie) who approached me in a coffee shop. Looking back, I now realize Charlie was also emotionally manipulative and at times abusive - he followed me around the city and pressured me to see him for dinner, studying, etc. I didn’t have the words for it then. I never felt fully safe around him, but I also felt pressured — like saying no to him physically wasn’t an option. Ethan forbade me from seeing Charlie, however I had no other friends and was struggling on my own in the city. I ended up having a relationship with Charlie behind Ethan’s back, even though I did not really want to. One night Charlie walked me back to my student accommodation and kissed me, and I did not have the words to stop it. I thought that would be it. However, during my last month studying abroad Charlie came over to my room for dinner and made physical advances towards me that led to sex. I thought, “I’ll just do whatever Charlie wants so he won’t hurt me and no one will ever have to know.”

I continued my relationship with Ethan for a year afterwards having never told him or anyone else what had happened. We finally broke up after I paid $5,000 for him to get a medical procedure done, took care of him, and found out he was sexting other women again and looking up escorts. The relationship ended with him refusing to leave me alone and a lot of screaming and crying on his part. 

At the time, the Charlie situation exited my mind like nothing ever happened until all of these memories came flooding back about a year and a half ago. When they did, I reached out to Ethan and told him everything, and all he asked was “do I need to get tested?”, told me to mail his tshirt back from years ago, and “being angry at you does not serve me.” It was very cold. 

Two months ago, Charlie reached out to me again with a message that reopened all of this. He told me that I needed to apologize to Ethan for cheating and said I had treated Ethan horribly. This wrecked me. All the guilt I had shoved down came roaring back, and I felt like I was a fundamentally broken, selfish person who only causes pain.

But part of what makes this so complicated is that I was also in pain. I was young, unsupported, and scared. I know I made mistakes. But I also know now that both of these men hurt me, used me, and contributed to the shame I carry today. I feel like I need Ethan’s forgiveness again, even though I’ve already apologized, and I don’t even know how to forgive myself. 

I’m married now to a loving and safe person, but sometimes I still feel like I don’t deserve love or joy. I feel “tainted” by what happened — like my sexual past defines me, like I can’t trust myself, like I’m dirty and unforgivable. I struggle with intimacy, and my body experiences a lot of pain and flashbacks during it.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you begin to believe you are worthy of healing after a past like this?

Then went to his garage that he thought was a space station and then got scared of aliens BTW he watched a lot of ancient aliens after he got back but besides that he went into a frenzy in the living room and started hand to hand combat to the carpet and then stayed sitting down then kept asking my mom *where is jeffrey* that’s me btw but when my mom got me to talk with he he looked me in the eyes and said I need to walk and I took him on a walk around the park and I kept having to keep him stable. After the walk he was still in the state but calming down but I made him sit on the couch and waited until the piece of shit ambulance pulled up and started asking my mom question and mention how she should relief his stress basically saying have sex with a fucking man whose in a episode.  After that he got token for a week and was hard to go a week without my dad but he came back happy he just said don’t take from his stash. Keep in mind I’m a stoner but when this happend I didn’t even smoke yet so he was definitely having things put in his head that didn’t happend.  I’m making this so I can better understand next time and also advise of how I can make his life better as a son it’s hard to fully dedicate to my dad all the time but every now and then we have breakfast at a cafe and we have are eggs and hashbrowns and coffee.  ,1754122330.0,3,3,ptsd,ptsd

My psychiatrist has prescribed me so many medications but I either refuse to take them or they never help. I already had antisocial traits due to another disorder but after the incident I’ve lost all empathy and understanding I had for people.

I cannot watch tv shows, go out, talk to people or stay alone because something always triggers me.
The only way I can avoid a bad episode is through drinking every evening (it gets bad in the evenings when I’m unwinding from the stressful days).

I’m constantly exhausted or zoning out. The only one who’s somewhat supportive of me is my mother. She reassures me that everything is okay during episodes but everyone else looks down on me and tells me to just “get over it” as if I control my delusions. I’m labeled as crazy and on top of that I have to somehow control my episodes because my family was “smart” enough to leave me in charge of a 4 year old (I’m managing).

I’m only 20 years old, my life was hard as it was due to another disorder but now it seems impossible. I’m close to dropping out of university, my social life is very surface level and I’m unable to emotionally connect to anyone (not even my family).

We had court issued supervised visitations. Shit was a mess. I barley remember last summer. But him and typically my stepmom would vist me 3x a week.

We had a few rocky visitations and some missed visits following him leaving me. 

The 2nd to last visit, we fought. Its so disgusting what he was even doing i don't want to say. Just trust me, when I say I was patient. I didnt yell at him untill 45 minutes into the 1 hour visit... I  got removed from the visit by the supervisor. 

I had a panic attack and vented to the supervisor, discussing abuse he did. 

I didnt see him for another week.

He shows up with all my belongings. 2 cart fulls of shit. In the dhs lobby. 

Everything I told the supervisor? he found out. Every detail.

he sat down in the visitation room, doesn't look me in my eyes the entire time. Tells me I essentially abused him, and I was the problem. He told me he didnt want to see me anymore.

1meudbw,I can’t fall asleep until the sun comes up,"T.W. for >!s.a.!< and >!chronic illness!< 

Hi, all,

I need some advice and am wondering whether you can help.

Ever since I moved to a new town four years ago, my PTSD has decided that sleeping during the night is too risky and that I have to stay awake until the sun comes up. I have traumas from things people have done to me or that have happened to me at night or in my sleep. 

Most days, from 8:00 p.m. until midnight, I feel *exhausted* and can’t wait to crawl into bed. It’s always the bedtime routine that gets me, though. I realized that, due to a combination of >!s.a. trauma!< and >!anxiety about IBD!<, I’ve grown to be terrified of the bathroom. I obviously have to do bathroom stuff before bed, though, so, each night, it takes me hours of distracting myself with Youtube videos or podcast episodes to be distracted and dissociated enough to be able to do bathroom stuff. 

By then, my brain has launched into Hyperactive Distracted Mode and/or Turbo PTSD Adrenaline Mode, and then I can’t sleep. I’ll lie in bed and toss and turn, or never go to bed because I’m stressed out, or pace around the room having hypomanic “genius ideas” until the sun comes up. Then, usually, my brain finally realizes it’s time to sleep, and I conk out from maybe 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. until 1:00 or 2:00 p.m.

I’ve tried staying up all day and going to bed at a normal time. I’ve tried slowly shifting my schedule. I’ve tried making commitments for myself to get out of the house. I *still* can’t fall asleep at night, so all that happens is that I get sleep deprived and run on adrenaline for a few days. Then, as soon as I have a day off, my body crashes and goes right back to the dawn-to-midday schedule. 

Currently, it’s 7:45 a.m., and I have yet to fall asleep…after being so incredibly exhausted at 7:00 p.m. that I almost didn’t go to work and so sleepy at 1:00 a.m. that I contemplated not coming home and sleeping in my office. (My work is flexible, so I can do it whenever I want, and it doesn’t really stress me out that much. I could work from home, and honestly probably should have last night, but it helps me mentally to leave the house to do it.) This plague of not sleeping until dawn is atrocious to deal with. 

What can I do to fix this? I was thinking about getting a sun lamp to trick my brain into thinking it’s daytime, but I know that sun exposure is bad for circadian rhythms and that all the advice says to have more daylight during the day and darkness at night. Has anyone else struggled with this? 

Edit: Aside from getting sleepy in the evenings, I’ve always gotten very energized before dawn, even in my adult years of not sleeping all night. I think my body’s ideal sleep schedule would be 9:00 or 9:30 p.m. to 5:30 or 6:00 a.m., but I just don’t know how to get there when I have to much baggage around getting ready for bed and such a hard time sleeping during the night.

1metebg,How to stop Binge Eating,"I need some serious advice to stop binge eating. 

For context: I am 23. I’m in the military, a normal healthy weight, but have had issues with binge eating since I was 13 when my dad died. Most of my family has drug and alcohol abuse issues, but I have managed to avoid that luckily. I left my family at 17 to get away from the abuse and trauma & have not ever been able to get away from the binge eating. I am able to maintain my weight from extreme amounts of exercise and constricting. I have been SA twice since being in the military and that definitely made things worse. I saw a therapist at one point, but digging up trauma made things worse and I am now in a complete hole.

Please give me any advice how to get out of this and stop this cycle. I need it desperately. I have gained 10 pounds this month and the exercise can’t outdo the amount of eating I’m doing at this point. I feel helpless and out of control. ",1754045893.0,3,8,ptsd,ptsd
1meyale,am i being dramatic for being so bothered by this?,"last week, i received a message from someone i hadn’t spoken to in over a year because we fell out, and in this message she essentially confirmed that whilst we were friends she’d secretly hated me for months before we stopped speaking and that every time i checked if id upset her or if there was anything wrong, she lied when she said everything was fine and she had no problem with me. i also got an almost identical message from another friend id had at the time even though he wasn’t involved with that situation particularly 

i was shocked to even be hearing from her and so i responded because i wanted to know why she was telling me this, hoping there might be an apology down the line. i was wrong. she started talking about how she was trying to ‘better herself’ and felt guilty about lying so wanted to come clean, a year and a half later. i tried to raise the point that if she was going to be a better person she should stop being friends with my abuser. my abuser actively pushed me away from all of my friends, especially this one, saying they weren’t good for me and that i’d be better without them, and acted like she would stop being friends with them too but she only got closer with them after 

after i tried to tell her that her best friend is an abuser she snapped and told me that i have a ‘raging victim complex’ and that she ‘genuinely thinks that [i] am insane, evil, manipulative and without an ounce of empathy’. she also said that i have ‘the biggest victim complex [she’s] ever seen in a person’ and that i need to ‘fix myself’. i tried to respond but she blocked me before i could

i’ve really been trying to not let this get to me as i know that the chances of my abuser being behind this whole thing is incredibly high, especially seeing as 2 separate people both messaged me at the same time. this is exactly the sort of thing she would pull and she knows that i’m incredibly paranoid that i’ve somehow lied to myself and don’t actually have ptsd and that im a terrible person (i have ocd and moral obsessions are very prominent for me). both my abuser and this person know i have ptsd which is why i think she chose to say i have a victim complex, to get under my skin, but i can’t help but worry that she might be right

what if i do just have a victim complex? i have no physical evidence against any of my abusers, and i didn’t even realise any of them had abused me for quite a while. the abuser involved here is the most recent one; we dated for 3 and a half years until this january and i don’t know if it was always abusive but it definitely was most of the time. she was emotionally, verbally and sexually abusive and she also hit me once. i tried to tell her about things that she’d done that had upset me before but she never listened or accepted her faults, so when i broke up with her this year she said it was very surprising

am i at fault for not trying harder to tell her before when she upset me? is it my fault for not having more of a backbone and standing up for myself? or maybe i have somehow twisted it to make me the victim. my friends tell me that im not at fault at all but i can’t shake the fear that i am

that message has been bothering me for over a week now and i just had to get this out somewhere. i thought i was finally free from this abuser and that she wouldn’t bother me again but apparently i was wrong",1754059283.0,1,1,ptsd,ptsd

1mel1sp,You CAN get better,"First off, some people never will get better from PTSD. this doesn't mean they're ""weak"" if you can't or never will get better.  But that doesn't tell the story of the entire PTSD community.

I don't like conversations about PTSD being some permanent evil curse. It can be managed. That won't be the case for everyone, but you have better odds than you think.

This is an old reddit account I had that I posted a lot on this sub. In 2019, I almost suffered a fate worst than death. It shattered my psyche and I felt like an animal after for years. 7 years later. PTSD is something that just occasionally flares up. There are some things I used to enjoy that I probably will never be able to again, but I can work around that. It left some scars and things I have to work around too. I go months when I don't think of the ""event"" and some months I think about it everyday, but I'm able to put it in a pretty remote parking spot if that makes sense.

In general, A lot of studies only study the worst cases, with volunteers who are desperate for help and these studies take place in a limited amount of time. Thus, the common wisdom is that PTSD can never get better. There was also that guy who wrote the Body Keeps the Score who basically turned out to be a total hack. Some of the book is good, but I didn't get passed the first few chapters. My point is that the medical/psych community is in my opinion overly negative about the possibility of management/recovery (prognosis) of PTSD.

I'm not gonna lie, I find the negativity of this sub, while understandable, is actually sort of toxic to recovery. Lurking this sub I know for me, just makes me worse, and I will probably decide to hide it from my feed from now on.

Recovering from PTSD to a point where it was managed was for me, a delicate balance between slowly exposing myself to triggers, while being careful not to get re-traumatized. PTSD can make us distrust our own gut instinct, because it becomes kind of defective. Giving us major warning signs on mostly harmless stimuli. It's important when managing it not to accidentally let something legitimately bad in. At somepoint in the mid stage, I started dedicating time each week to meditate on what happened to me, so that it would feel less intense when I got majorly triggered. And somewhere along the way, it just stopped being a problem really, after 5 years or so. At *some* point in your recovery, a door that was always locked will unlock without you knowing. And its the choice to consciously move on, to let go of all the hate and injustice and horror. It's a choice (ONLY when recovered sufficiently) that you will be able to simply consciously choose to close this chapter in your life.

Since then, I do feel my challenges gave me strength. I feel like the people around me look to me as a guide, a trusted person, and a leader. Everything I have gone through has not been a net negative.

1meu5zx,Overcontrolling myself in social situations,"The context is that I tend to over-control my actions in social situations because of anxiety.  
To be completely honest, the real reason is that when I feel something I’d like to express, whether it’s a passing thought or an emotion, I’m never sure how it will be perceived, maybe they’ll think I’m weird, stupid, annoying or something like this.

So I over-control myself and don’t allow spontaneous expression. I’ve been like this since childhood.

I thought nobody noticed, but once, while hanging out with friends, one of them asked me directly, “Why do you never express yourself spontaneously?” I felt kind of called out..

Yet I watch other people say genuinely silly things as jokes, stuff that sounds weird or even stupid to me in the moment and I never feel negative about it. In fact, I feel that laughing about those things together creates connection.

I know this, but it’s still hard to open up. Whenever I do manage to express myself, it almost always turns out great, people relax around me. Otherwise, I can sense them staying closed off because they see that I’m holding back.

I don’t like when people feel distant or formal with me, I want them to be friendly and spontaneous. The thing is, I’m tall and have a very deep voice, and when I also don’t express myself people probably think I’m a serial killer or something :D

im really tired and the ache of wanting to leave is always there. i wish i could be safe for once or loved unconditionally. im so stressed out. i feel so stuck. i have so much to do like late homework and assignments etc but im just breaking down. i am seeing a therapist every weekend but why’s the week go by so slow. i feel out of place even talking to her. i feel stupid and weird and like what i say sounds so dumb or like embarrassing or like im just lazy or smtng. im so tired. and i hate myself. i hate this. i hate hiw debilitating it is. im so insanely depressed i hate it. the anhedonia is killing me. it’s ruining my life. my rooms a mess, im a mess, im just so miserable and i wish i was happy because i want to be happy and normal and have normal good experiences and feel happy and alright. just a vent. sorry. i don’t have anyone. i found a group of friends and they’re great and im comfy w them yet im still in my head. even when i try not to be and do what my therapist says. i just feel like such an outsider and awkward and like im annoying or like an afterthought. idk. i’m just insane.

1mej82p,"I feel so alone, i just need to vent.","
Hello. I have cerebral palsy and dystonia, I got a neurological evaluation done a couple months ago and got the results 2 weeks ago. And boy did it validate a bunch of things. I was diagnosed with complex PTSD, major depressive disorder and ADHD( I already was diagnosed with ADHD) and boy did it help taking abnormal psychology before this😂 

The reason why I told you that is because my PTSD symptoms are getting worse( I’m in therapy to be clear, I’m also in CCS(it’s a mental health agency that takes medicaid)) the problem is that my dissociation is getting in the way of therapy, I can’t stay present for more than ten minutes without dissociation for half the session. I do therapy virtually. Even talking about every day things sets me into an episode. It’s very scary. 

And on top of all that I don’t trust my mom. A little back story is my mental health started to go the first day of senior year of high school (literally). And as the year went on my parents both thought I was doing it for attention, my special education teacher kept checking in until one day she broke me and the rest of the year i cried every single day. When I went to 18 and beyond program that teacher had the same effect on me. And that when most trust that I had for my parents went out the window, and 1/10 2023 they made me had surgery that was unnecessary and I didn’t want, and had been traumatized ever since. I have a family psychotherapist on my team and my mom has gotten much worse since she been on the team. I don’t think she has learned anything from doing this. Like on 4 of July I got yelled at for being selfish( because I didn’t feel physically safe being in my aunt and uncle’s condo) and she said to me that’s not how a 21 year old acts, sometimes we have to do things we don’t want to do. I was already going outside my comfort zone with being up there. 

It has taken an incredible amount of self control to not text my teacher and tell her what’s going on and to come and get me. I literally cry for her every night. I feel so alone with no support. My teachers were the only support I had and now they are gone. I can still text them.

Since my initial diagnosis it’s been up and down, but I notice every time I’m in a hard spot with flashbacks and hyper/hypoarousal I never seem to want to give my partner affection and can’t help but feel horribly uncomfortable and even a little bit disgusted.

It makes me feel sad, because I don’t want to make them feel unloved. I try my best to hide it but every time I go into a spiral of reliving memories and these ups and downs I just want to be left alone and isolated, which is difficult because we are attached by the hip haha.

I know it’s a common symptom to be struggling with relationships, or seeking isolation. But even then, I believe people are more understanding when they see it’s coming from a depression standpoint rather than PTSD.
Since I’ve been diagnosed properly I’ve tried to communicate to the people in my life why I am the way I am, but they sadly just can’t grasp at how much this affects my life in so many different ways.

My partner knows and is rather understanding of it all, and I love them oh so dearly. I just don’t know what to do with myself because my memories and emotions are explosive, that’s why I tend to self isolate.
Sometimes, I want to leave because I don’t want them to deal with me (which is not exclusive to only them, almost 100% of the time I want to leave my friends and family as well)

1mdnw43,Can you have PTSD at 14?,"(Tw: child abuse - physical, emotional)
Hello, I'm 14M and am wondering if its possible to have PTSD at 14 or if its something that develops later in life. My mother is emotionally abusive and used to be physically abusive to me when I was younger. She has extreme anger issues and when she argues with my dad, he goes to a separate room to calm down from the situation. My mom bangs on the door to the room he's in (the room he goes to is directly next to my room) no matter how late at night or early in the morning it is. My mother screams when she gets mad and once in 2021 they argued for 9 days straight. When they argue in their bedroom, my mom usually slams doors or throws things. There have been times I have had to lock my door out of fear that she would hurt me, and my dad tells me to lock my door. Whenever shes near me I feel extremely nervous and my mood gets put off, because I know anything can make her angry. Now whenever I hear a bang anywhere that sounds like when she would bang on doors, (even if its not at home) I get nervous and get reminded of when she would throw things and bang on doors. 

My dad, my brother, and I are going to move away from her since she technically owns this house. A few months after we move out, I plan to ask my dad if I could get an assessment for PTSD, autism, and selective mutism. I'm already diagnosed with high anxiety. 

Btw, I am NOT asking for a diagnosis or for someone to tell me what mental illnesses I may or may not have. I'm just wondering if PTSD can be formed at this age and if this is enough to seek a diagnosis from a professional.",1753923444.0,15,13,ptsd,ptsd

1mdx7na,I have the traits of a social-anxiety achiever,"Hey everyone,

I’ve always read a ton of psychology stuff, mostly to figure out why I’m nervous around people 24/7. A few days ago I stumbled on an article that described my exact experience line-by-line and called it “**social-anxiety achiever**.” 

  
**Quick note:** that label isn’t an official diagnosis, you won’t find it in the DSM. It’s just a handy nickname floating around blogs and podcasts for people who mash classic social anxiety (fear of being judged, constant replaying of conversations) with an over-achiever streak (high standards, perfectionism, lots of invisible prep work).

  
I went down the rabbit hole after that and, sure enough, every source I checked lined up with what I live every day.

My biggest struggle is the endless replay in my head after any social moment. I’ll get home and rerun every single word I said, worried I messed up or sounded weird. It’s exhausting—like I’m carrying a projector that never switches off, always reviewing my own blooper reel.

Funny thing though: as soon as I finally had a name for it, my brain kicked into problem-solving mode. Within just a few days I noticed I was giving myself permission to stop overthinking so much, almost like “Hey, we know what this is, we can chill a bit.” I’m not magically cured, but the constant second-guessing dialed down enough that I can breathe.

1mdo00y,I was almost in a tsunami yesterday,"I work at a facility very close to the coast, basically only meters away. Yesterday was my first day running the facility alone (no other staff) so of course a tsunami evacuation order came about 2 hours after I started work. I got calls from my brother, boss and boyfriend at around the same time ordering me to evacuate immediately. Upon seeing the alerts on my phone, I immediately felt an adrenaline rush and all I could think about was getting out of there immediately. I tried to stay calm but I could not think clearly. All I took was a clipboard with some data and by the time my boss called was already running out to my car.

After evacuating to higher ground, I kept my eyes glued on the ocean and turned the radio on to hear updates. The way they kept repeating ""evacuate immediately and get away from the coast"" etc. and the tone of the radio announcer's voice was terrifying. I have never been in a natural disaster before so I wonder if I am overreacting but the uncertainty and helplessness I felt was very upsetting.

I had to stay in this parking lot without food for about 6 hours, unsure of what would happen next because my supervisor is on a business trip and was mostly unreachable. I started feeling woozy and my head started feeling cloudy while I was waiting in the parking lot watching the ocean. I don't know if it was from lack of food or adrenaline or both, but the physical weakness on top of all the uncertainty definitely didn't make the situation any better.

I didn't know if it was safe to go down to lower ground to get food and this was distressing to me since my boss was unreachable and the contracting company I work for is based in another region and didn't have access to that sort of information. 

When I finally left the parking lot, I was still on edge and not sure if going to lower ground was safe or not since the tsunami warning was still in effect. I had to go back to the facility to turn the lights off and then I was ordered to go home by my boss. As I drove home, I broke down crying. 

Now it's the next morning and the adrenaline hasn't stopped. I feel like I am overreacting to this but I have already been diagnosed with PTSD from something else, which I know can raise your risk for getting it again from another event.

What I want to know is, what steps should I take today and in the following days in order to prevent getting PTSD again? I am taking the morning off work today because going back to the facility is a bit scary for me, even though the tsunami warning is not in effect anymore. I can't stop thinking about the radio announcer's voice and my body is just really jumpy and on edge.",1753923749.0,3,4,ptsd,ptsd
1mdpwa3,Recently diagnosed and I’m scared of healing,"TW: I mention a sudden death due to domestic violence, but do not go into any detail. 

I kind of already knew ptsd might be something I deal with based on my involuntary reaction to people raising their voices at me and the flashbacks/nightmares. Despite having that inkling, being officially diagnosed has kinda made it worse? Im not entirely sure, could just be that the anniversary was a few days ago, but I wasn’t even aware the anniversary of a traumatic loss was coming up. Maybe I knew subconsciously, but I’d been diagnosed a week or two prior. Maybe a mix of both? This fabricated flashback popped up. I lost my sister very suddenly to DV. I wasn’t there 13 years ago when she passed, but this “flashback” put me there. 
I’ve built an image of what happened and how over the years because when I was young, dumb, and numb to every emotion except anger I would read the articles. It was fucked up. I was also driving to work where I am a support professional to autistic folks and my god was it a hard day. 

I’m scared, every time I do written exposure therapy to heal an old trauma, a new one that I’ve repressed pops up,  And whilst doing W.E.T I’m an emotional wreak for a few days after. I’m so afraid that there are more repressed traumas and the next one is going to break me. 

But on the flip side, whilst healing slowly, I’m feeling more. This is coming off the back of being numb completely for 5 years and then a very slow recovery of feeling more and more through Theatre class in high school and on and off therapy over the last 8 years.
I’ve been in a relationship for 5 years and the love I have for my partner is growing more and more intense as I heal. I say intense, but it’s probably just how “normal people” feel. I feel like I’m going through what my teenage years should have been emotional intensive wise as a 25 year old and I know ultimately it’s for the best, but god it sucks.

1mdduh5,How do I adjust to school again?,"I'm 15F were diagnosed with PTSD few months ago. Due to my condition, I'm unable to attend school because of the fear inside me.

I used to be one of the bravest student in that school and my name are quite big in my school. However, now that I have this condition, I am very very scared of going to school.

My family did try to adjust to me school again by bringing me over there during school day. The day before I was begging and crying like crazy because I'm seriously not ready to face a huge crowd of students.

They brought me to school anyway. I accepted it as I believe I have no choice. The thing is that, the moment I see my classmate's face, I immediately have panick attack begging to return home.

Now that I'm moving school, we still need to resolve something like those important documents. My family will of course ask me for more school details and it's like as if my body couldn't work. 

It could but with a strong push. I think it's because of that push, I had a mental breakdown. I can only answer a few questions before I couldn't talk anymore.

I'm afraid that this will affect my studies as I'm scared that I'm not only scared of my school but as long as the term is 'school' I will be scared. This means that going to school will be very hard for me. 

Any tips on how to adjust?",1753898822.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd

1mcv1op,I think I might have ptsd but idk if I’m overreacting about what happened,"Hello all, I am posting this here as I didn’t know where else to ask and I found this subreddit to be the most fitting.

I’m 15 years old and I have a history of mental health issues. When I was 13 I was in therapy and on meds for depression and anxiety, and I also have adhd. the depression and anxiety has gotten a lot better to the point i wouldn’t say i am depressed as I’ve healed. However, having adhd I struggle with task paralysis and executive dysfunction to the point I struggle to get out of bed and clean ect, let alone do schoolwork.

This incident happened back in February, and things like this have happened before but not to this scale. This plays in my head constantly and I routinely cry over it and get flashbacks.

In February, we had mock exams to practice for our GCSES (end of high-school qualifications for my non-Brit folk). During this time (and pretty much my whole life lol) I was really struggling to even get out of bed. I’ve never revised for a single exam or done a single piece of homework because of my crippling exhaustion and task paralysis. As you can imagine, that’s not the optimal situation for someone to be in during mocks. Due to this, I was so exhausted I just couldn’t bring myself to go to two of my 12 exams during exam week. I needed a break and I was so exhausted, I really do care and I’m told I’m gifted and intelligent, so this stings to not be able to reach my potential.

My mum wakes me up and tells me I have an exam. I tell her I didn’t want to go because I didn’t feel well (not too far from the truth) and she flips, starts shouting and says she’s going to call my dad to come force me to go. She puts me on the phone with my dad and I don’t really remember the conversation since my brain has blocked it out but it was just a lot of screaming and he said “if you don’t get up I’m coming to drag you there”. I knew he was serious because he’s done it before. In another situation he came to my house with a hammer and was going to smash up my laptop but that’s another story and isnt the reason I’m posting this. He comes to my mums house and bursts through my room. He’s screaming and dragging me out of my bed onto the floor. I’m screaming at him begging him to stop because I was terrified and in extreme emotional distress. I get up off the floor and run to the bathroom, he chases me in there and is screaming at me, I can’t remember what he said because my brains blocked it out, but I know it was a lot of “you’re lazy” and general threats. At this point I’m trapped inside with and he’s walking towards me, forcing me to walk backwards. Because my bathroom isn’t the size of the White House i eventually run out of space to move back and he keeps going forward and indirectly makes me go into the bathtub and I slip and smack the back of my head on the wall behind it. I have an immediate large bump on my head and at this point I am absolutely SCREAMING in pain and boy it was painful. I run into my bead screaming in my pain and my dad is like “stop being fucking dramatic” and all this shit “this didn’t hurt” i tell my mum and dad there’s a bump and my mum goes “oh here she goes again playing victim, she’s gonna tell the school and accuse us of abuse” (she does that a lot btw and saying im gaslighting) and they say it’s not that bad. I can’t remember what happens next but my dad eventually leaves and so does my mum and my dad tells my whole family how lazy i am, and then says he’s gonna stop paying for my school because “I don’t give a shit”. Then I have my whole family telling me to start trying and that’s a whole other dilemma. My dad also has this habit of telling me im all these swear words and im a lazy idiot But aside from this, he’s a good guy, he’s a really loving dad and I know he loves me. He’s taking me to Tokyo this summer and we do have a good bond on there surface (ignoring I don’t feel close enough with him and don’t really have a bond ) but we talk about video games and stuff. He also goes through this weird cycle of “you’re lazy” and “well done I’m so proud” RAPIDLY. The night before the incident he was telling me how proud he was of me. I think about this constantly and now I’m scared of my dad and I’m constantly hyper vigilant when I’m at his house, I have flashbacks and it makes me upset constantly, tainting our relationship.

i was diagnosed with ptsd maybe two years ago? and it’s always infringed on me relaxing. i feel like i always have to be DOING something, or i feel like im “being lazy” or “selfish”, and “im going to get in trouble if things aren’t done”. and i want to be able to relax. nine days off of work is great!! but i just can’t. and i don’t want my supervisors to look at me and say “weren’t you on pto?” so ive logged out of my work email on my phone, and deleted our documentation app off of my phone for the time being. i haven’t turned on my work phone, which is good!

1mclnwn,turns out people don't actually give a shit about how i feel,"so um basically, im not going to share much except for the fatct his has to do with surgery scars related to the whole thing i got ptsd from in the first place. i am half russian, and my russian grandma does NOT know boundaries for shit. my parents were out and i stayed home with my younger sister. she enters without any warning, does her usual conversations which she does every and any time she sees me (""why dont you call, why dont you visit, you should do X and act like Y and be Z"" always judging me and moderating how i SHOULD act. she ALWAYS has things to say as if she's knowledgable in everything and anything possible.)

but then she started to talk about the scars i've got on my knees. “i’d put polydine on that”  
\- “grandma it’s dry that’s my skin”  
she judges my knees... “that’s not the leg you got surgery on right?”  
\-“no grandma that’s the other one” she looks at my surgery scars “yeah but that is gonna fall off right?”  
\- “grandma, again, that’s my skin, there’s nothing to fall off, it will stay like this”  
she then CLOSELY INSPECTS MY KNEE looking CLOSELY at that one problematic scar. and when i said she got uncomfortable close, i mean it. “it will stay like this? but this is bold” she commented.

yeah gramma i’m not happy about this either can you like NOT point it out?? she’s the reason i’m insecure and wear long pants in hot summer like 99% of the times.

EDIT: she also told me ""you'll get over it soon enough"" when i reffered to my trauma because she obviously talked about that.

anyways. fast forward, i tell my mom (her daughter) about this interaction. she just... laughs. and says ""yeah grandma is knowledgable in everything and anything. you're the one who chooses to take this harshly."" then ""jokes around"" and copies what i told her; she gets uncomfortably close to my knee and says ""this is bold"". obviously, i dont like that.

after like 20 min i get out and tell her that i did NOT appreciate that interaction i had with her mom - she rolls her eyes and sighs loudly. sure, i tried telling her again, but i quickly retorted to my room because oh well what will she know?

people constantly think they know what they're talking about when giving me advice or trying to console me for having PTSD. They don't get that what i'm going through is serious, they care about the compensations (disability insurance money) rather than my mental health. if they even do that is. it's genuinely insane.

About 3 years ago I was raped repeatedly by someone i once called my friend. She had a method-- get me outrageously intoxicated before suggesting sex. I almost always said either 'no', 'maybe not', 'I dont know', but even when I said 'yes' i was far too out of it to really understand what it was i was agreeing to. 

She would handcuff/tie me up before using dildos to penetrate me. If the simple act of her raping me wasn't enough, she was so violent with me that i now have permanent, painful scarring inside of me. Any form of penetrative masturbation now results in bleeding, incredibly reduced pleasure/sensation at all, and lasting pain (feels like intense, constant cramping on the right side of my uterus/vaginal area). 

I used to love sex. I loved masturbation, I loved enjoying my body and all the wonderful feelings I got from loving it. I feel like I lost a part of myself when she forced a silicone cock into me so violently that my insides ripped and scarred until i couldnt feel pleasure anymore. I hate the feeling of penetration, I hate the pain if get when I try to touch myself like I used to, I fucking hate her for breaking me like this. I feel so broken and disgusting. all I want is to feel that pleasure again, I want to love my body the way i used to, but i cant because each time I try I bleed and I hurt for hours after.

1mchmlf,How should i confront my abuser tw:sa,"(I am using a fake account for my well being)

Hello, I am a 20 (f) and have been struggling with my trauma relating to my sexual abuser for years. We were both in 8th grade at the time and I recently came out as Lesbian to my friends. We were in a private christian school and the whole school in a sense shipped me and my best friend (m) for awhile.(cause boys and girls being friends was unheard of) Over the course of 8th grade, we would sit next to each-other near the corner of class, with my other friends on the other side of this 4 top table. Under the table he would violate me almost everyday the same way. I had tried to deescalate it by creating space or moving his hand, but he would only do it again.  The whole thing was extremely complicated as he was my best friend and I was mortified that I was in a situation like that. At the beginning of this year I finally told my mother about the situation, she was the first person to hear it and now i've been getting the help I need. I can't do anything legally cause we were both about 13 at the time and there isn’t any proof other than my experience. I am going to confront him over text and I don't really know what to do or expect. I wrote out a draft in my documents and it was harsh and angry, calling him every name under the sun, but I don't really know how to handle this confrontation. I think that he will defend himself and it could turn ugly or it will okay, but i don't really know. I could really use some advice about the whole thing. 

I will also be moving across the country in the next month so i know i want to confront him before i leave so if things do turn south, i will be okay in a geographical sense. ",1753809854.0,3,2,ptsd,ptsd

I know that a lot of girls with these problems will get into codependent relationships or their lack of a father figure will show in their sexual preferences, but I personally don’t have very bad traits or kinks related to it. It definitely affects me, but it’s never made me act out or be inappropriate. The strong crave I have for a father is such a warm feeling to me. I daydream about the idea of being someone’s little girl every single day. The thought never leaves my mind and it’s been like this for a few years now. I’m just confused because I have never heard of anyone else my age who is obsessed with older male figures without it being a kink. I don’t ever find myself in toxic relationships and I actually push negative people away very easily & quickly. I’m not a jealous person either and I’m never really anxious or scared when it comes to my relationships with men.

I had a wierd experience with another friend, and I felt so off since two days and I dropped my bestie a msg asking am I a bad friend or person? And he called me right now as I was writing this post in full intensity crying and he asked me what happened, listened to me told me why do I feel a need for someone else confirmation about wheather I am right or wrong, good or bad and If I have not done anything wrong and if I don't know what I did wrong to the friend I should not assume I am the worst and I should wait and ask the friend that's acting differently and I should not blow this situation out of proportion. Take it for what it is, a minor hiccup. And answering my question he said he think I'm the worst of the worst person,  Laughed and asked this is what you wanted to hear? Are you happy now? Told me not to seek others approval and go with my own sense."" You know who you are. Don't take other's behaviour personally. ""
But yes having difficult interactions with others make me feel that I'm worthless and brings out my worts fears to surface and I start panicking.
I also realised while talking to him that what I am projecting ( that my other friend is extreamly angry with me and want to hurt me) is coming from my childhood and current experience with my family where everything was/is was taken as an offence and punished with physical/verbal abuse or damaging my things, and that's why I was so highly triggered and panicked, not bcz my friend was angry with me.

He said 33. And it took him stumbling over his age, and his birthday, for me to look into it. And an Instagram post on his own page revealed the truth. This lie kind of scared me, and made me angry, so I ghosted him.

I did only ghost him for a short while, however. Less than 2 weeks, I’d say? When he sent me a message, saying he was so bummed and disappointed that I ghosted him. And honestly, I missed him, and our conversations. That, mixed with the guilt I felt after reading his message, got me chatting with him again. Yay. By my 20th birthday, on May 17th, 2025, we were talking all day again. But not without issue. He held the time in which I ghosted him over my head like nobody’s business. I felt guilty and humiliated. And along with this, the comments on my age truly began. He’d made some the first time we talked, but now, it was all the time. “Oh, I don’t know what that is” (a phrase I’d come to regret) “Well, that’s because you’re 20” - “My birthday was great” “I’m glad. And you’re so crazy young!” - as well as suggesting things, like books or music, that in his opinion would “change my life” and that I’d apparently be unaware of because of our “generational gap”. I brushed them off, though, because I didn’t want to be seen as immature, nor did I want anything held over my head. 

So fast forward to a date at the mall that we went on. He’d arrived only an hour before closing. I was moving fast because I had a lot I wanted to show him. And what would you know? Held over my head! Constant comments about how I move too fast and like running away from people. Somehow, this also resurfaced his comments on the period in which I ghosted him. It hurt me, honestly. And days after this, is when I’d come to regret my comments about not knowing what he was telling me about. He had been doing HIIT, he told me. And I said, “Oh, I know what that is. And I HATE it.” Before I could even say this, he said, “That means high intensity interval training. Now you know. Because I spelled it out for you.” And then, upon hearing me out, “Oh, my bad. Probably mean, but I’m so used to you saying you don’t know things.” It wasn’t his first comment on my knowledge, or apparent lack thereof, but it hurt me. And I began questioning whether or not I came across as stupid to the people in my life. Did I really come across as so naive? Ok. Laugh it off. Can’t come across as immature. Take his ever growing condescension with grace. 

Our next date was at his house. We made out and cuddled the whole time. It was great. I felt so lucky. But mixed in with the sweetness? Comments on my age, and the conversation of, “Do you actually listen to Gregory Alan Isakov?” “No, why?” “Oh, I just would’ve thought you were actually indie and cool.” - “You need to switch it up, too much Taylor Swift. Where’s the cool stuff?” Not too deep, not too serious, but what? And of course the mocking comments of how he’d been to more concerts than I had. Ok. Lovely. Isn’t like you’ve had 15 more years to go to them. But it’s fine. We have good conversations and that was a good time. 

Our next date was right back at his house, again. Here’s where it all went wrong. I knew what to expect going in - our second time talking, after the ghosting period, had progressed rapidly. It was all day, every day texting, and heavy flirting. And then, after we made out that last time, it just went further and further. We had conversations about my virginity. I knew what to expect. So I arrived, knowing. But I couldn’t have foreseen this.

He first took off my shirt, looking me in the eyes, and telling me, “I’d never do anything to make you uncomfortable.” Then it was my bra. Then he went to my pants, but I said no. He listened. He removed his shirt and came to cuddle with me. He put his hand in my pants, and in response to my silence here, took it as a yes to taking off my pants. This time I didn’t stop him. Then it was my underwear. Then his own. And then we cuddled. He asked me for my hand, and I gave it to him, because I enjoyed holding his hand. He placed it on his penis. I pulled it away. He laughed at me. He put a blanket over us, afterwards, saying it was “more cozy”, but quickly I found out he wanted to hide the fact that he was masturbating. I don’t know if he felt weird or guilty, but he stopped, uncovered, and said, “Is this okay with you?” to which I responded, very awkwardly, “I don’t know.”, to which he responded, “So that means yeah, sure!” And I guess he picked up on my awkward silence, how unsure I was, and said, “Just kidding. It doesn’t mean yes! I’ll just give myself blue balls, it’s fine.” Before covering us with a blanket again. He then asked me how far I’d gone with previous boyfriends of mine, “Oh, just making out” to which he replied, “You’re so innocent…I kind of feel bad.” He started masturbating again. I should have left. I should have known. But I stayed. He asked me, moments later, if my virginity was something I was trying to lose? I said yes. We didn’t talk about it anymore. He sucked on my breast, once again without asking, until I said to stop. Which he did - momentarily. Before starting again. Stop. Did. Started again. Then the topic of sex came up again, and I said I did want to lose my virginity - and so I did. He applied lubricant to his condom, and then his fingers, and then to me. I didn’t like how it felt when he was fingering me, so I told him to stop. He was doing it rough. He acknowledged that I didn’t like fingers. He inserted his penis, it was going fine, until it hurt. I said, “ouch.” and he said, “the first time always hurts.” And then I said ouch again. And he stopped. “Hang on, let me change my condom.” He walked into the bathroom, before coming back out, “I was also losing my hard…because I feel guilty.” Oh. Ok. He tried again but it really hurt. Before we tried again, he went down on me. A couple times of him removing himself, and inserting himself again, very painfully, he applied more lubricant to his condom. And then his fingers. And then, he slid his fingers back into my vagina. He said, “I really need to, to open you up.” I was silent. He pulled them out. He spit on them. He put them back in again. It was terrible. I was so unsure by now, and just completely silent. All I could think about was how he acknowledged very recently that I did NOT like that or want that. Then he inserted his penis again. After telling me, once again, that he felt so guilty for hurting me. Also received, what he called a check-in, of, “You still want this, right? I’m sure you do, because you’re 20, and that’s old enough. You’ve been waiting for forever.” We went for a while, and I said it hurt. He said I’d soon be obsessed with it, the first time always hurts. When I started crying, saying ouch, he finally stopped. I went to the bathroom to change into my underwear and bra. I was bleeding. I checked after I saw blood on his pillow case. I was in so much pain. I walked out to him finishing, since he was, “so close.” He called me over. He asked to admire me while he finished. “I’m going to cum. Not on you. But near you.” Nope. I walked away to put my shirt back on. He had a work from home meeting in less than 15 minutes, so after that, he changed. Before walking out of his bedroom, he said, “You’re okay, right? Wouldn’t wanna give you any trauma.” Oh, interesting comment. While he was in his meeting, I made an excuse to leave. I gave it. I left. I cried my entire drive home, and I cried the next day. And then I went numb. With some very random breakdowns mixed in. I stopped caring. I dropped the Summer courses I’d taken to boost my GPA. I didn’t care about a thing. I couldn’t think of anything else. I was lost and my heart was kind of broken. He wasn’t who I thought he was. And did he care for me, truly? Or was being my first all that mattered? Or my innocence? 

The next few days, I knew I needed to cut him off. He asked me where my “spunk” went, as I began pulling away. And finally, about a week later, I said we had to stop talking.

Now it’s July 7th, 2024. I’m so numb. Still, mixed with those random breakdowns. Still, I care about nothing. I’m dropping future plans I had left and right. I have bad dreams, I don’t get restful sleep, and I have terrible mood swings. I go from perfectly fine, to bawling. I miss myself, who I was even just 2 weeks back. I regret going over, and I super regret staying past all the signs I saw leading up to us having sex. I regret agreeing to have sex, with him. I feel hopeless. I had such ambitions for my next school year, gone with the classes I dropped. I have flashbacks. I swing or rock a certain way - standing or while laying down - I feel it all again. I move my tongue a certain way - I’m right back there. I cringe. I have random flashbacks. It randomly enters my mind and I feel it all over again. I doubt myself and my knowledge. I wonder if I say that I don’t know things too much or if I come across as stupid or like I know less than I should. Or if I come across as immature. But at the same time, I could easily convince myself that I’m overreacting. That I’m being dramatic. I also miss him like hell. I thought we might have had something special, and real. I was thinking of ways to introduce him to family, eventually. We had such good conversations, and inside jokes. So much reminds me of him. I have so much I want to tell him. But I will never go back. He hurt me. It wasn’t okay. None of it. And now I’m just kinda here. Lost.

NOW it's July 28th and i still feel so awful and lost and sad. i'm. still. numb. but also so angry. and so hurt. i would've loved him for a long time. he could've had everything i could've given him. i realize more and more how bad some of it was, and it shouldn't have happened. but i miss him anyway. it's all too much. i think of it and i cry. he took part of me and i'm dealing with the aftermath adn might be forever",1753758235.0,2,10,ptsd,ptsd

1mbp7dj,My boyfriend just informed me that he woke up in the middle of the night to me digging my fingernails into his arm?,"I grew up in an highly unstable environment, and would be told of sleepwalking episodes by my mother and backed up my my siblings and mother's husband at the time. Infrequent, but noteworthy sleepwalking up until I turned 20 as far as I'm aware, and believe it stopped in my 20s onward due to roommates and exes not mentioning any out of the ordinary or out of character behaviors. Although, now that I think of it, a man I was in a relationship with when I was 18-20 would wake me up in the middle of the night on occasion because I was kicking him in my sleep. I was informed of violent episodes that required me being restrained while on steroidal medications that were needed to reduce swelling during my childhood. My mother said I was on Prednisone maybe 4 times, and each time I think it might have caused episodes of psychosis branched off of the sleepwalking from how my family made it sound, because I have no memory of the described prolonged violent behaviors, and they just tolerated the abnormal, uncharacteristic behaviors instead of stopping the steroid treatments or seeking psychological help for me during those times.

My boyfriend mentioned that I was hurting him last night, and I didn't do that, would never have done that, and have no memory of it, but some part of my consciousness did act on that, and it was my body, so I technically did. I'm concerned that I may still be sleepwalking, or having abnormal but at least bed-bound sleep behaviors that I have no control over or memory of. If something is starting again, assuming that it ever stopped, I'd like to nip it in the bud, if possible.

I've been ruminating, reflecting, processing, am painfully self-aware, and have become very open about my life and experiences as I've gotten older. And have had a build up of stresses and repeat traumas over the years. I thought I was doing much better and at a point of finally healing.

I've been with my long-term friend turned boyfriend for a little over a year, and we've been living together since late May/early June. He hasn't noted anything like me seemingly intending to harm him in all of this time until today. Being aware of any violent behaviors, no matter how minimal, has me concerned and paranoid, especially me not being aware of or in control of causing harm or potential harm.

I'm taking this very seriously. What can I do to hopefully prevent my body from reacting aggressively while I'm unconscious?",1753729546.0,8,3,ptsd,ptsd
1mbytsk,advice wanted-- motorcycle compulsion,"Over the past year, after a traumatic incident related to my abuser and motorcycles I have developed a strange compulsion. Everytime I see a motorcycle I must check if my abuser, or his wife, are on the bike.

For context (no abuse details), my abuser and his wife live in my town and they often drive motorcycles. I escaped my abuser in july of 2024. My compulsion started in September 2024 after I was driving with my family, and saw my abuser drive past us on a motorcycle. (he was wearing a half helmet and I could see his face)

Since then, I *have* to check every motorcycle i see or that drives past to see if its him. Sometimes I get so scared and think its him that I get startled. 

Im only 15 years old, and cant leave the house alone easily due to this compulsion/fear.

1mbrara,PTSD from vertigo,"Hi all. So, to start, I've just been diagnosed with PTSD. The PTSD stems from a serious illness I had as a teenager that went undiagnosed for months. I had vestibular neuritis, which makes it seem like the room is endlessly spinning. Lack of the right therapies and medicines lead to me missing my last 2 years of high school.
Now, I'm 35 and the vertigo is back. I woke up a week ago spinning and unable to stand or walk. I had to go to the ER and they gave me treatments that helped some. But now, because this happened when I was waking, I'm terrified to go to sleep. Every morning I've been waking in a panic attack and cannot seem to calm down until well into the afternoon.

Its like my mind and body are in two separate places, im aware im in my house and i see my home but i feel like im not actually in my house. this happens when i experience or do similar things that happened there, like when i feel dazey from medication, or when someone helps me get up, and i get reminded of a short memory from the hospital and i feel like im there again and it gives me a trapping feeling.

1mbp8yt,Nightmares advice,"Hi everyone, writing to ask your advice about nightmares. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD last year, and it’s complex, but my life-threatening trauma was over 8 years ago now. 

I’ve been a daily weed smoker for 15 years, and recently decided to quit because it was causing really extreme anxiety and flashbacks during the day.

But now, I’m honestly way worse off than I was before because I am dealing with the worst nightmares of my life, and I haven’t been able to get a decent night’s sleep for weeks. I’ve heard about ‘REM rebound’ after quitting weed, and most weed quitters (non-PTSD-ppl) will just tell you to tough it out. On the other hand a lot of PTSD folks recommend weed to deal with nightmares. So I feel like I’m in this endless circle of advice. 

I know some people have success with psych meds for nightmares, but I’m already on so many psych meds, so I’d really rather not add more. Open to CBD / melatonin / other ‘natural’ things.

Just wondering if anyone here has experience with this or could offer a few words of advice. Thanks so much for reading 🙏

ETA: last night I had a couple cups of sleepytime extra tea, and I managed to get some real sleep and reduced nightmares. Anecdotal for now but very glad I finally got some rest.

1mbhk59,Quick to anger,"Update at bottom of this post: 😍

My spouse has complex PTSD due to a rough childhood and policing. He has been aware for around ten years and dealing with it in the right ways. 

Here’s my post:  He is so quick to anger and he is immediately defensive regardless of the situation. 

We put up a pergola and he wanted a fan for it. I suggested we use the standing fan we already have and he said no, he wants to buy a hanging one, gave me all the reasons. Ok no problem. Then after a five minute conversation with his buddy, he’s sending him money to buy a new floor fan (honestly a great price and on sale). So I ask about it, confused, and he doesn’t understand why I’m “arguing” with him. The floor fan we already have is according to him a piece of poop and doesn’t stand straight, and so on. He’s trying to save money by buying this fan on sale. He doesn’t understand why I’m confused and asking. I asked why he shot me down yesterday when I suggested the fan but then today when he chats with his friend, all of a sudden the fan is a great idea. He says it’s cheaper than a hanging fan and I should be happy about that, etc. and then he walks away. 

So how am I supposed to just let this kind of stuff slide? For almost ten years now I’ve been letting things slide, explaining everything away with the diagnosis. He’s a good man, not a jerk, we are very happy. But this type of stuff makes me feel like my ideas aren’t valid, like I’m the one making things difficult, like I’ve caused this tension. 

Maybe someone with a good grip on/understanding could give me a little advice?

Update: 😍
A while after our conversation, my husband came to me on his own, asking if I was upset because he didn’t think my fan was a good idea but his friend’s was, but that he knew it wasn’t really about the fan. 😍 He’s a great person, and truly loves me. He tries so hard and sometimes I get frustrated with his struggles. Sometimes it does feel like it’s about me and that I’ve done something wrong. And sometimes it is me, all me. I’m grateful he works so hard at being the man he wants to be. ",1753712640.0,7,6,ptsd,ptsd

I'm a 19 year old college student thats been suffering from ptsd for almost a decade now. At the beginning of this month I had a really bad trigger leave me dissociative and unable to eat for almost 3 weeks. I hardly slept and just felt awful, I couldn't focus or do anything. Just cried alot. Felt like I would never be able to do anything without getting triggered again and reacting like i'm still a little kid.

The worst part is that im taking two summer classes that were supposted to get me off of academic probation. If I fail I'll be put on academic suspension. Both of these classes have horridly low grades as when I could turn in work the quality of the work was awful at best. 

I really want to be able to explain this to my professors and get my grades back up, but i have a week and a half before the classes end and i just don't know if its possible. Or if they would even take it seriously or think that i would get the full learning-ness of the classes work. Ive really tried to keep up to date with videos and assignments when I could. I just feel like I could've tried so much harder. I don't even know if its worth it to explain or if its just going to come across at trauma dumping or like a pity party.

There’s this Korean YouTuber named slimechu that I used to watch as a kid, he speeds his voice up and uses silly sound effects so it’s definitely made for children but something about the stimulating nature of his videos makes me fall asleep and not have any nightmares, it’s amazing.

I’m mainly wondering if it’s okay if I don’t have symptoms daily. Like I have minor symptoms daily but not super huge ones daily. (Ex. Daily I’m usually hypervigilant, paranoid, and anxious but not constantly thinking about the trauma)

Probably good to mention that my trauma happened 6 years ago when I was 9. I was groomed by a 30 yr old male teacher. No one really believed me because it didn’t get to SA (at least that I remember) and I have sever dissociative amnesia so I don’t remember everything crystal clearly. In December of last year I was severely triggered and it threw me into a really bad depressive episode again so that’s when my ptsd rlly started showing. At least, I finally began to recognize it and stop telling myself I was crazy. 

I feel crazy bc I’ve had a flare up this week (medical analogy I use to describe when ptsd feels so much worse quickly than it usually does) and like constantly thinking about it, replaying it, thinking about it to the point of nausea, crying, nightmares, trauma reenactment, etc. Idk why, anyone else experiencing highs and lows or is that not normal?

1mb7vwo,24 m struggling,"(Trigger warning for SH) 

I (24 m) have a complicated history with my mental health. After being separated from the Navy due to a mental health crisis, I moved in with my partner at the time and it was the worst mistake of my life. She was older than me (not a problem but to provide context), didn’t treat her borerline personality disorder, and had a cocaine problem that she “hid” quite terribly from me. She would threaten me, scream at me, hit me, self harm in front of me and say it was my fault, try to overdose after being abusive towards me and basically force me to be the reason she didn’t die on several occasions, and become unresponsive and yell for hours, cops had been called by neighbors on more than one occasion after she would hit me and every single time I was treated like I was the aggressor even when I had been cut and bruised by what she did to me. I never stood up for myself, I never responded, I basically acted like a doormat because for so much time my choices were basically to either stay with her or be homeless. This went on for two years until I finally got out a year and a half ago. (Honestly so much more happened to me but I truly don’t have the mental bandwidth to explain everything in detail).

Since getting out of that terrible situation, I have found someone. She is so kind and patient with me, and I want to be the best partner I can be for her but I still deal with so much of the harm that my ex has done to me. I feel so trapped in my brain. I know she won’t hurt me, I know she won’t do any of the things my ex did but there’s this horrible feeling of guilt that I carry with me constantly because of what she did to me. I feel like a horrible person. I want to cry, I want to tell her why certain things make me uncomfortable still but it’s SO hard. What doesn’t help is that I’m living in CT, originally from WA, and since getting out of that relationship, even making friends has been difficult. (To clarify, making friends has been difficult because friends that I made during our relationship would talk to her after we broke up and she began to stalk me, and try to contact me for months after we broke up after I’d blocked her number and socials on everything. And she’s tried to contact other people I’ve met out here to “see how I’m doing” and it’s made me incredibly uncomfortable). 

I have nightmares that who I’m with now, which we truly have a healthy relationship is going to suddenly flip a switch and treat me the way she did. I’ve moved twice since leaving because I don’t know if she’s going to try and find where I live. I just want to know if anyone has gone through similar feelings, what did you do to get through them, or what help did you seek?  I’m sorry if this is incredibly jumbled, it’s 1:30 am and this is something that I’ve been wanting to reach out about for so long but haven’t been able to find it within myself to ask.

Thank you so much for reading❤️

On the positive side: things I’ve done for myself since leaving that situation aside from finding someone who truly cares about me even if I haven’t been able to disclose all that she did to me, I found a job that I love, I finally started going to college last year, and I finally started trying hobbies to see what makes me happy internally rather than as an escape from life around me.

However I reached the point when 2g literally half a day or a day max.... obviously I have cravings because this was the only thing made me somewhat functional...long story short been put of Drug recovery....not even phone the number (will do today) but wondering if they will treat the underlying cause of my misuse or just deal whit this and let me go off whit my PTSD.im worried if this not get treated I will relapse.

1mb0edo,Relationships are terrifying.,"Tw for self-harm, discussing drug use, and abuse

I don't know how to stop this. I'm fairly sure I have feelings for someone, I know I do. I'm not fully sure what kind of feelings they are, but theyre stronger than anything Ive felt in a long, long time, and that thought makes me want want to hurt myself or drug myself until I domt have to feel it anymore. 
I started using drugs to cope with what happened, what my ex did to me. It was supposed to just be weed, turns out addiction runs in my family. Eventually it got worse and worse.
This friend, who ill be calling E, has been one of my closest friends for a while. We met online, a short while after my ex almost killed me. We became really close friends, theyve been with me through the absolute worst. We made plans to move together in Baltimore. When we first met up irl, I felt more alive than I have in my whole life.
Now its happening. We're living together in Baltimore, and I'm pretty sure I love them. I remember driving here (I previously lived in Alabama), I remember the only thought on my mind was how if I could at least have them there with me, then everything would be okay.
I'm terrified of losing them. I'm terrified of being hurt again, my heart starts beating and I can't  breath and I just can't handle it. I know how they feel about me already, which is to say, I'm the only one holding us back from making this official. I'm just horrified of  it. I keep seeing them hurt me in my head, and I feel horrible because I know they'd never do that. But then again, I thought the same about my ex.

I built walls around myself to protect me. I still have flashbacks of bleeding in my bedroom, and promising myself that I'll never let anyone get that close to me again. And now every time I feel someone getting close to me, I panic. It feels suffocating, and I get this 'run for my life' feeling that takes over and I can't make it stop: And right now it feels worse than it ever has, I keep breaking down into tears and my lungs feel stiff and I feel horribly sick.",1753657686.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd

1mavxfz,I’m having trouble sleeping.,"Every night, I have to take psychiatric medication. But lately, I’ve been skipping it often because it makes me feel drowsy all the time — even during the daytime. However, once I go back to taking it, the drowsiness suddenly goes away.

I still have to attend school and study, but in every class, I tend to fall asleep. I also struggle with learning and reading. I can't seem to understand academic subjects at all. During exams, I can't clearly process written information — especially if the question is long. I usually have to reread a very simple question more than six times just to begin to understand it, and even then, it takes me a long time to grasp even one single point. I often get a runny nose, yawn repeatedly, feel heavy eyelids, and my head becomes foggy.

Because of all this, I’ve stopped taking my medication recently. But when I don’t take it, I can’t sleep at all. It feels like there’s a computer inside me that never gets shut down. Most of the time, I only nap for about two hours — sometimes not even that. And every night, I end up thinking about past traumas — the years of sexual and physical abuse by family members that began when I was just seven years old.

I don’t really know what’s considered “normal” or “abnormal” in this world. I feel like I’m still just a child — always needing someone to guide me. Otherwise, I might die from being clueless. My mind never rests. It keeps replaying everything over and over — even in my dreams. I sleep, but it feels like I never truly rest. These thoughts haunt me even in the morning, throughout my daily life.

Sometimes, it’s triggered by people’s actions, or even just words, tones, sounds, or images. There was one time when I punched someone in the face, and they had to be hospitalized from the bleeding. I felt so guilty because I didn’t want to hurt anyone. But at that moment, something triggered a flashback, and then I started hearing voices telling me to do it.

Normally, I never hurt anyone — only myself. But these kinds of things keep happening, and I can’t always control it. I can suppress it as long as no one becomes violent toward me first. But I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

There’s so much I can’t even explain — not even to the doctors. So maybe I’ve been given the wrong medication. I’m afraid that if I tell a doctor everything now, it’ll get back to my family, and then everything will fall apart. I’m sure of it. That’s why I plan to keep it to myself until I’m old enough to seek help independently — when my treatment doesn’t have to involve my family anymore. Because what happened is just part of the past.

But right now, I feel so exhausted. I don’t know what to do anymore.

1mav2pn,What would you do in my situation? (long),"TW: CSA, abuse, suicidal ideation, mention of diagnosis

I (25) have been dealing with this for as long as I can remember. There was never a point where I was okay. It just never stopped. I’ve spent years fighting, but I’m out of energy now. Every second I’m conscious, I’m in psychological pain. I don’t have “bad days,” I have one endless state of being, and it’s unbearable. I don't feel any emotions besides ""negative"" ones or numbness.
I'm in a situation where I genuinely don’t know what to do, and I’d really appreciate honest advice from people who’ve been through something similar or just have perspective.


My diagnoses:
- complex PTSD
- severe depression
- social anxiety (that just flared up severely thanks to recent events)
- binge eating disorder
- ADHD
(- possible undiagnosed autism)
(- subclinical narcissistic traits)


I have long-term (childhood) trauma and other compounding factors. My life is severely limited by CPTSD symptoms, executive dysfunction, chronic dissociation, chronic suicidal ideation, and a level of social anxiety that makes it impossible to exist normally. I can’t function. I'm completely exhausted. Literally unable to do basic tasks. Cooking, showering, appointments, messages, everything piles up and becomes impossible. I can’t even watch a movie or sit still without dissociating.
When I try to do something, even just getting up or brushing my teeth, something in me shuts off and goes dead. No amount of willpower fixes this. And the more I push myself, the worse it gets. I ran out of clean towels and my clothes are next. Trash and dishes are piling up again. Everything is filthy. I am this close to sleeping in my own waste.

I’ve been kicked out of a trauma-focused inpatient clinic recently. Their reason? That I was “too sick” for their program. Yes, seriously. Too ill for trauma therapy.
Since then, no outpatient therapists or clinics have offered anything remotely helpful or stable. Some don’t call or message back, others act like I’m too complicated. I’m just passed around like a problem no one wants to deal with. This just perfectly mirrors CPS when I was actively going through CSA and other forms of child abuse.

I live alone. My parents were always emotionally and psychologically abusive. Still are. They talk at me, not to me. They ignore everything about my mental state and only ever reach out when they want something, like physical help with yard work.
They’ve never shown actual care, only control. And when I don’t act how they want, they guilt trip or punish me.
They also always accuse me of things I didn't do and I can't escape it. Still, they act like they “don’t understand” why I’m not closer to them.
I can't just go no contact with them as I somewhat rely on them financially. If the government decides to not pay me anymore, they will be all I have. And on a social basis, they are all I have.

I can’t work. I don’t have the mental or physical stability to function even part-time.
But I only get minimal government support, which isn’t enough to live on.
I’m constantly broke, constantly stressed about money, and unable to apply for better benefits because I can’t get the energy or focus to get through the paperwork.
I don’t have a partner, I don’t have friends I can rely on financially or emotionally. It’s just me. It always has been just me.

Where I’m at now:
I’m stuck in survival mode 24/7. No one believes how bad it is because I can still “talk okay” or write in a way that seems functional. But writing something like this already takes me a huge amount of energy, and I’ll be shut down for the rest of the day after this. I’ve already been through three clinics, tried multiple therapists, multiple medications, self-help, official support systems, and even turned to AI. None of it worked. Not even slightly. I feel like I’m trapped in my body.
People keep saying “reach out” or “ask for help,” but I’ve done that.
And the result is usually: No response, or people telling me “you just have to try harder"", or ""I'm too difficult of a case"", and I end up worse than before.
I don't want to run through my last scraps of energy just to be dismissed again by people who don’t want to actually help. Or can't. I have nothing left to give. No money, no resources, no more support systems to try.

This isn’t a temporary crisis. This is the end stage of years of untreated, misunderstood trauma. I'm alone, barely functioning, chronically unsupported, and too mentally and physically exhausted to keep fighting for basic survival. 
I don’t want to go in a closed ward just because I’m suicidal. I’ve been in those places before. They don’t offer real therapy, they just contain you. I don't need to be locked away and tortured until I promise not to hurt myself. I need a way to survive without being forced into systems that hurt me even more. Locking me up won’t fix the reasons I want to die. It will just make me feel more powerless, more broken, and more alone.

Any serious thoughts are welcome. Please don’t tell me to just “keep going” without offering something practical. What would you do if you were in my place? If you wanted to die every single second you were awake, but you were somehow still here? If every system meant to help just made things worse? If your only options were pain, numbness, or collapse and no one to help you?",1753644193.0,2,3,ptsd,ptsd
1marau4,Had a panic attack during an exam I can't retake,"Because of an abusive childhood situation I never aquired a formal education. I'm 27 and this year I wanted to take my highschool exams (vwo netherlands). 
I had made all my exams with pretty great marks, which was amazing. But there is also a  verbal exam attached because Dutch exams are usually 50% school grades and 50% final exams. The verbal exam was yesterday and I didn't even need to get great marks, there was no reason for me to panic at all. Yet when I walked into the classroom and saw the 2 examiners sitting across from me I had a fullblown meltdown. It is not possible to retake the exam sadly, there is a slight chance I would have still made it because I did well on the written portion of the exams but honestly I don't think it will be enough to make up for what happened yesterday.

Then I felt wrong so I crouched down, then ended up sitting. I kept blacking out for seconds at a time. At one point water was flowing into one side of my nose and I couldn't breathe or move my head to breathe. Finally the sensor light went of and being in the dark in water scared me enough to open the shower door. Then it took me a long time- rubbing and slapping my legs, until I could get up and turn the water off. At one point my hands looked tanned to me and I thought they were odd. Afterwards I realised they'd turned purple.  


All I did was wash my elbow in an upwards motion, and it was enough to trigger all this. 

  
I asked chatgpt and they said it was because I went into freeze over fight/flight and then cooled myself too much.  

What happened to me? Does anyone else experience this? I've been blacking out for a few weeks like this- not at work but at home. Little seconds of fading out and coming back. I've had dissociation and derealisation for years- sometimes it lasts weeks. But blackouts are new- apart from once in the park where a man asked for a selfie with a woman and her pram and I agreed, but he looked me up and down and put an arm around me instead for a selfie.

My sibling snitched to my mum about it and my cousin was the only one to have my instagram at the time so I can assume she told family first. I ended up getting beat because of the picture and forced to take it down. Again, just a kid. I never understood what was wrong. They never explained it to me. I think that lack of elaboration and straight to punishment just really bothers me to this day.

Fast forward to a few years later with this same sibling, when they asked me if I had social media I completely shut down and got scared to answer so I pretended I didn't. This sibling then gets angry that I lied about it. I blocked what happened after but I think I got beat or pinched. Man, my memory is just blanks sometimes. I hate it.

Long story short, the trainer looked like the person that caused me a lot of trauma. And the nature of the class certainly made it harder. I thought he was just an instructor. Turns out I will be working with him regularly. He came in today, and I froze. Immediate dissociation. Followed by panic and tears. I held it together for half an hour to the end of my shift. I thought I would be fine to see him at work, but I was wrong. I don’t know if I should say something to my supervisor or if that would give them enough pause to fire me. I just started this job a few weeks ago.

1ma6wra,"I tried everything, I am an utterly unremediable failure","Read ton of self help Books, went to different therapists, tried different medications, psychedelics, ketamine (this one I've actually been abusing lately), microdosing LSD..
I swim 2.5km 5 days a week, sometimes I add yoga. I eat super well. I'm in the sun daily. I live in a countryside house.

I still suffer a lot.

While some of the mentioned stuff works to some extent, I still have a life in which suffering is prevalent, I still have my suicidal moments, I still have huge setbacks, I still struggle in relationships, I still walk around people kinda scared all the time, I still have panic attacks after I masturbate, I'm still addicted to porn, I still abuse substances from time to time, I still look for ""painless suicide methods"" online, I still take very poor decisions which are making me risk my job.

I don't fucking know if this is PTSD, I don't understand if I have some bipolarism as well, I'm just confused from therapies and therapists and what you read online..

But anyway my life is a mess, I still think I am lucky because I have many privileges, if I had born in a country where life's harder or in a city I would already probably be dead.

The thing that makes me suffer the most is to see how hard I have to work in order to be a quarter of what most other people normally are.. To have another round of hope and optimism and see it crushed completely every time when a strong enough trigger happens. I don't think that other's life is just good, but I also know that most people never actually think about ending their lives. For me that's incredible.

That's why I've been abusing ketamine lately: I could finally walk around people and just feel okay, genuinely curious about them, it was so good to finally be free that I cried..
But I don't want to risk abusing it for real and destroy my bladder, so I've stopped..
I know there's some place for ketamine therapy in PTSD, but I tend to abuse and not to have a good control over this stuff.
It saved me from being suicidal with a single session that made me feel good for 4 weeks straight.
But I just don't trust myself in handling addictive substances, one time I got prescribed xanax and after 5 days I tried to kill myself with it.

I am just stupid and I cannot learn from experience, I tend to be carried away by certain stuff.

Honestly I just hope to die while I sleep one night and not have to think about all of this anymore, or that a miracle cure comes out which is accessible and just works without any side effects, something that just erases the excessive fear away from my brain once and for all. But that's not reality, right? Reality is pain for most of the time.
3 months feeling good for one year and a half of suffering, that's the ratio of my last optimism/decay cycle.",1753570840.0,3,2,ptsd,ptsd
1ma7yz8,Maintaining relationships with PTSD,"Since my diagnosis and specialist help I can certainly say I’m on my way to becoming a better person, but there’s one thing I’m still struggling with and I find that it’s causing more issues than good. One of my most prominent trauma responses is fawn (appease, avoid conflict, try my best to prevent ANYTHING bad happening, big or small) and this is often in response to anger, even if this anger isn’t directed towards me. This has led to issues where sometimes one friend in the group (friend A) will express their frustrations about a situation or other friend in the group (friend B).  Friend B will realise things aren’t quite the same between them and friend A and will ask me if I know anything about it. I will often conceal what friend A has told me and try to come up with another explanation which does add up, but isn’t entirely the truth to prevent friend B from becoming hurt or angry. Both friend A and B are under the assumption that I’m mediating this disagreement, and then become more frustrated and confused when there isn’t a resolution. Does anyone have any tips on how to stop this? I know that concealing the truth ALWAYS ends up poorly, but in the moment I can’t seem to help but tell either party what I think will make them the happiest or prevent them from being upset. I feel horrible and manipulative and I desperately don’t want to have that response but I’m really struggling not to. I’ve also been reassured by my friends that telling the truth won’t end in friendship and we can always talk things out, so it’s not as though actually telling the truth will result in long term negative consequences. I absolutely hate that I do this. Does anyone have any tips? I know it’s quite a niche situation, but if you’ve overcome something similar, or have any advice that’s worked in other situations then I’m all ears and willing to try.

1m9wnj9,I'm not good enough,"I've had PTSD for most of my life, but it's been especially affecting me these past few years, and I'm getting worried because it's been making me less of a person.

I used to remember all my friends and loved one's birthdays, remember their favorite foods, be able to keep myself up-to-date on what things they're up to so that I can check in with them later on how they were.

I can't do it anymore unless I have a whole ass planner where I write everything down and make a note to myself.  I straight up constantly forget if I don't, so it's gotten to the point where I have to write it all down in a paper planner, make a whole page in a journal where I list all my friends/loved ones' birthdays, and make it a virtual reminder on my phone's calendar just in case I forget to check one of them.

I used to be the person my friends and peers would go to for advice or help, and while I wasn't always perfect at it, and of course, I can always improve at this kinda thing, I used to be okay at it and it seemed like I was actually doing some good.  Now, when people come to me, even when they're going through something I've been through too, I'm often at a loss of what to say or how to help, and I feel so unhelpful and like I'm just making their situations/lives worse.

I used to be a good cook/baker and I'd make stuff for others, but lately, everytime I do it, the food comes out wrong or something with the drink I tried to make is missing something.

My nightmares are getting worse every year to the point where I'm getting afraid of going to sleep.  Sometimes, the nightmares are me reliving some of my traumatic memories, other times I'm going through things I'm afraid could happen to me.  

I don't know what's going on, who I am, or anything like that anymore, but I think the one thing I do know is I'm not good enough.  I'm not a good enough son, I'm not a good enough brother, I'm not a good enough friend, I'm not a good enough peer or coworker.

I was manipulated by manipulative people for years, stalked by them too. And i know they enjoyed the power trip and the fact that no one believed me. They did it to make me seem like the bad and crazy person. Like how narcissists make their victims look crazy whilst psychologically torturing them.

And i think about how i was stupid, i hate how i essentially let them do it because i didnt understand. I was manipulated and i dont trust anyone now, but i dont trust myself to not be manipulated by people in the future.

I hate myself for being stupid and giving them power. I hate how people cant see their true colours and want to define me by their behaviours (like how bullies do).

I hate people. Their is an undertow in this world and the covert, manipulative people play the victim, and blame the victim. No one is trustworthy and i hate how they had power over me. I hate how people gave them power. If any good comes from it, hopefully their other victims are vindicated. But they manipulate it so that their victims or any victims are used to help scapegoat other innocent people. They become who hurt them, essentially. I dont want to 'vindicate' myself by becoming like them. i will never stalk people and mess with their heads. They use their insecurities and problems as an excuse amd encourage others to as well.

I hate this world. I wish i had died because if i am different then it means they have defined me and i hate that. My existence was essentially for their entertainment for years and then they wonder why i have ptsd. I didnt go to war. I wasnt physically beaten. But stalking is abuse. And they hurt themselves to play the victim and allowed themselves to continue.

The people we are supposed to trust arent trustworthy. They passed their trauma onto me so they did win and i hate that. I wish i had died before they had any power over me. I hate the fact that they got to do it, and they got away with it. I hate the fact that they enjoyed it. They qre cruel and manipulative people that only care about their reputation.

I was so ready to end my life that day. 3 days have passed now, I'm still alive and breathing, and it was exactly the plan that was supposed to kill me that ended up saving my life.

I've had suicidal thoughts for a very long time. I managed them well, but recently things have pushed me over the edge. I won't get into detail about that part, things were just not good at home, and it was effecting my life outside of home. The plan was fully in motion now. I was passing through my days knowing I'm going to die. Part of my plan was to fuck up my life as much as I can before I go. I had been sober for a long time but I'd started drinking again. 

I made three attempts. The first two times I failed, but I was determined to try again. On the day I tried again, I knew I wouldn't fail. I bought some alcohol and got quite drunk. I had my equipment in a gym bag beside me and I was just walking around with it for the whole day. I wanted to have some fun before I died, so I had called some escorts, and I asked them if they're available. 2 ladies. It was all part of the plan. 

I gave them a lot of money but it didn’t matter to me, money has no value when you're dead, right? My gym bag was in the same room, just beside the bed, they asked what's inside, I just said my gym clothes. The problem was, I was so far gone, emotionally and physically, that I couldn't even get hard. I had 2 beautiful, naked women in front of me and I felt absolutely nothing. I had a massive breakdown in front of them. I was ready to leave at that time but they stopped me, and they talked to me. I put my clothes back on, we ordered some wine, and we sat there all night just talking. I dumped everything on them and they listened, I showed them all my hobbies and the things I've created, I told them about the lives I've changed through my work. Lives that I have saved. 

They actually showed me... love? Or some kind of love that I haven't known. They showed me how much I actually matter. It was the place I least expected to feel something like that. They didn't even watch the time or anything, they let me stay as long as I needed, and I'd gone way over the time limit that I paid for. I apologised, but they gave me their personal phone numbers and we've texted eachother.

Before I left, I told them they just saved my life, and that I won't be ending my life tonight. We hugged, and then I left. Still had my equipment with me, and now I'm even more drunk, but I reached out for help this time. I called an ambulance. I was sat there around midnight on the street all alone with just my suicide equipment beside me. They took a long time to come, I had started to think they weren't coming and had another massive breakdown. But they came, and they took me to the hospital. 

I don’t think that money went to waste, I think I used that money to buy myself some more time. I'm getting help now, and I'm grateful to still be here.

I told him I have been seeing therapists and doctors for decades and I don't feel comfortable discussing my trauma with people I don't really know in real life or at that trust level. Like I would need to be in a relationship with someone before I think it's any of their business really. 

But this sparked something in him

He would not quit

Despite me saying no multiple times and asserting my boundaries he kept trying to get this info

To the point where every conversation revolved around trying to get me to tell him my trauma and relive pain for his curiosity and amusement 

I had to unmatch and block this person

Where people become literally obsessed and ferocious

It's almost like he expected me to be willing to over share with this total stranger

And he wasn't the first it's just I sort of thought he was a nice person before this switch was flicked

Others like this normally do it much sooner usually immediately before I talk to them much

And they refuse to accept no and boundaries

It becomes the only thing they will talk about is trying to convince you to confide everything into basically a total stranger almost like they get off on my pain and suffering

1m9s7cg,PTSD from watching my mother die,"Big TW - Sensitive topics

Hi everyone,
I'm just looking to vent and find people in a similar situation. I'm a young girl, I lost my mom a year ago and the memories/nightmares haunt me everyday. I've attempted to take my life 4 times since I lost her and the cycle won't stop. 

My mom was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer, she was young (in her 30s) and the cancer had already spread throughout her body and brain by the time she was diagnosed. She'd experienced very little symptoms beyond tiredness and a cough, so the cancer had progressed drastically without anybody knowing. My mom was SO young and fit that it was surreal to think she had tumours littering her entire body.

She was ok for the first 2 months even after starting chemo (which they said was purely to 
'prolong life'); she was her usual bubbly, active self. However, by month 3 you could tell the cancer had progressed much further than expected. She suddenly began vomiting, sleeping all day and developed infection after infection. A scan revealed that some tumours had infact grown. At this point, doctors didn't think continuing treatment was in my mom's best interest. 

This is when everything went downhill. I watched as my mom sat back and esentially let the cancer take over. She would scream in pain and cry and tell me she was terrified to die. She would choke and vomit brown liquid everyday due to her lungs filling with infection. She could barely walk or leave the house, she struggled to even use the bathroom and would scream in pain trying to pass stool. All I could do is rub her back and try to tell her it'll be ok. We both knew it wouldn't. 

One day I came home and she was laid in bed, her mouth was crusted shut and she was none responsive. I rang the hospital and nurses rushed over. They told us she needed to be admitted to hospice, they estimated she had a few days left. An ambulance took her there and I could only sit in shock.

My mom lasted a few weeks in the hospice once they'd gotten her onto end of life medication. It perked her up at first as the pain meds were stronger. However, eventually her body just began to shut down for good. She stopped eating, she looked like a skeleton. She'd sleep with her mouth and jaw hanging open, gasping for air as her lungs and airways were now full of cancer.  

That last day is what haunts me the most. She developed what they called a 'death rattle' in the morning. The nurses told me she had 48 hours at most. Though she was actively dying she also had 'terminal agitiation.' This meant she was trying to stand up, trying to shout and trying to speak to me even though she couldn't. I remember her gasps, trying to form words that I'll never decipher. Sometimes she didn't even make a sound, she just moved her mouth. The only thing I managed to hear were her small gasps, she was saying ""help. help."" She looked really really afraid in those moments. When she opened her eyes her pupils were just fixed onto nothing. I don't think she could see properly. She began leaking brown and red liquid from her mouth and nose, she kept trying to grab her water and the doctors told her she wasn't allowed a drink as she couldn't swallow. All I could do is hold her hand and tell her, ""Please don't panic, I'm here, it's ok."" 

Eventually the doctors told me they were going to have to sedate her. She was so agitated. They gave her so many injections and she fell asleep. I sat for 6 hours long into the night listening to her gasp, gripping her hand. Every breath had a long pause, her breathing got shallower and shallower. I eventually fell asleep out of pure exhaustion. I awoke at midnight to a nurse shaking my shoulder violently. She told me that it was time. I sat up and stared at my poor poor mom. She was blue and gasping and her eyes were wide open despite her being sedated. It was like she was staring into a void. I said goodbye and told her not to be afraid and that I love her, I cried and my teardrops hit her bloated face. She took one last breath and left me, just like that. I watched her eyes glaze over and felt her body go stiff in my arms. The nurses held her eyes and mouth shut as I just cried and cried. I had to ring all my family and let them know, I listened to them sob down the phone, cry and scream at me like it was my fault. 

I sat with her for hours after that, her body went so pale and cold and stiff. I tried to grab her hand, forgetting it wasn't the warm, soft hand I'd held just hours before. I didn't leave her side for an entire day, waiting for the funeral home to arrive and take her. I begged them to let me in the car with them, I didn't want her to be alone. They said no. 

Idk if the nightmares will ever stop. The exact moment I said goodbye etched into my brain. I told people she went peacefully but it couldn't be further from the truth. How can I live knowing the person who created my entire being had to suffer so violently? How can I escape from the dreams of her distorted face, the moment replaying even when I'm in a deep sleep. Sometimes I have breakdowns and just want to be with her. I'd give anything to know she's ok now, that the pain is gone. Sorry for the long winded vent but I needed to get it out. F*ck cancer.

1m9dhn4,A part of me wishes I wouldn’t have survived.,"I was in a car accident in September of 2024. My brakes failed (manufacturer error with my car) at 70mph as I was merging off the highway coming onto a T intersection. I knew I was going to crash, I thought I was going to die. I was on hands free calling with a friend, they said from the time I screamed “my brakes are not working” and them being able to hear the impact was all of 10 seconds, if not less. The whole accident felt like 10 minutes to me. Time genuinely slowed down and all I could think was “I hope my mom knows I love her.” I turned my wheel all the way to the right so I’d slide into the intersection and wouldn’t go face first into the tree straight ahead. I don’t remember even doing this. I ended up striking a truck which made my car do a complete 360 the opposite way and I went up over a curb. I lost consciousness on impact. Next thing I know I had 4 strangers who heard the accident from a nearby gas station trying to pull me out of my car. My knees were stuck under the dash and I had to be moved by paramedics and fire rescue. The rest is a blur to me until I was in the hospital.

All I had was whiplash, a bloody nose, a concussion, a hematoma in my hand, a bruised rib, and bruising on my knees. No major life threatening injuries/crippling injuries whatsoever. Everyone tells me I’m lucky even the cops and paramedics on scene told me bluntly they don’t know how I survived, that my seatbelt saved my life by not allowing me to be ejected, and that they’ve seen worse injuries from more minor accidents. I don’t know if that was their way of making me feel better. I don’t feel lucky. Everyone in my life tells me they’re glad I’m still here, but I’m not.

I feel like I can’t function. I don’t even want to drive anymore, but I have to because I have a job and bills to pay. I can smell the airbags going off every time I get into a vehicle. I can feel my knees start to burn even though they’re healed. My chest feels numb and stings when I breathe even though my rib is healed. I don’t want to go to work because I’m too afraid of getting into an accident on the way there. I still go to work, I still smile, I still tell everyone “yeah I’m so lucky!” But I feel like a shell of a human being.

I don’t want to leave my house. I get anxiety attacks just thinking about it but have to pretend everyday I’m fine. I don’t understand why I can’t function. It was almost a year ago, and I’m alive. That should be enough. I didn’t take long to heal, I was only off work for 3 weeks, and I got a new car within a month. I did everything I was supposed to do in order to get back on my feet.

1m9p9ws,Was this sexual assault? It's been years but it still bothers me.,"TW for drugs/addiction. I don't really know where to put this, I feel too ashamed to ask anyone I know in person.   
When I was in junior year of high school I was really deep in my addiction, I would take anything if someone offered it. I don't remember exactly how it happened, but someone gave me something (I think it was an edible or a pill) and I got way more high than I expected. This happened just before my last class. We had a sub that class and hardly anyone was there, it was a pretty big classroom, the desks were arranged in a way I could sit in the back and smoke without anyone really noticing. I was feeling really awful so I went to the very back of the class behind the groups of desks to lay on the floor, everyone else was sitting near the front talking in a group. I wasn't really able to move or talk, or at least I didn't feel like I could. I just felt so out of it, I think I kept falling asleep. A few minutes or so and some of my ""friends"" came to join me in the back (2 girls and 1 guy, we always smoked in the back during class). They were pretty used to me getting high during school so they didn't really say anything when they saw me on the floor. My eyes were closed, but I was awake. Eventually I think they tried talking to me, because I remember one of them shaking me a little bit. I don't remember everything but one of the girls started putting her hands up my shirt and laughed while saying things like ""She can't even feel it"". The guy came over and started doing the same while they made jokes, the other girl was kinda telling them to stop? I heard her say ""Guys leave her alone"" but I think that's it. I wanted to tell them to stop, but I seriously felt like I couldn't move or speak, I was just laying there with my eyes closed doing nothing while they were putting their hands under my clothes. I don't know if the people at the front of the class saw, but they didn't do anything if they did. The next day I came to class sober and tried bringing it up without seeming like I was attacking them. They made jokes about what they did, they didn't even think about pretending it didn't happen. I'm so confused because they acted like it was nothing. Am I over reacting?? I feel like it was my fault anyways. I mean I was doing drugs, something I already shouldn't have been doing. I trusted these people, I can't imagine they'd every try to assault me. I'm 18 now, I don't talk to them anymore. I don't know why this event affects me so much, it wasn't the only time something like this has happened but it's the one I keep remembering the most.

1m9io1s,Is this a possible trauma response or am I just greedy,"So, I’ve noticed that I have a habit of becoming really protective over food / anxious over the idea of it disappearing/being eaten. Most of the time this is about food I really like, but I’ve also noticed this reaction happens to food I’m indifferent about. 

Growing up, I did suffer through some good insecurity. My family wasn’t poor (we used to be really well-off before my parents divorce), however my dad would eat a LOT of food. Sometimes my mom would cook a large dinner, only for me to wake up to only a few servings left because he ate almost all of it when he came home from work.

He would also constantly eat all of the school snacks my mom bought specifically for me and my sister, despite my mom being super mad and telling him to stop and me and my sister being really upset and also asking him to stop.

I really hope this doesn’t come off as “aw well my dad used to eat my snacks as a kid so now I have food insecurities :((((“, I genuinely want to know if this is a possible trauma response. And if it isn’t, than at least I know that I’m just being greedy and can hopefully get better control over it haha

(I’d also like to add, my dad did way worse stuff than this. I’m not claiming to have PTSD just because he ate a lot of food.

I have no idea how to deal with this. He apologizes afterward, but I don’t know how to just get over the things he says. Even though he says otherwise, I can’t know for sure that he doesn’t mean what he says to me. And it has gotten so much worse recently. 

I love him so much at every other time than during these episodes (I’m sorry if episodes is not the correct term). I am trying to convince him to go to therapy, but he is so resistant because he doesn’t want to talk about his trauma.

Can therapy truly help something like this, or is that just me convincing myself that it will help in order to make myself feel better?

1m940km,"Had To Go To The Hospital, Panicked & Nearly Lost My Mind With A Fight & Flight Response - Now My Family Members Are Disgusted With My Behavior","Newly Diagnosed with PTSD so I want to know if this behavior is typical of PTSD.

Sorry if this is long, but I just wanted to see if anyone else has ever had an issue like this. I have had many awful things happen with life changing traumas and am very rigid and fixed in my thinking and always feel the need to be in control. This makes others want to stay away from me because I am difficult to get along with. I do not mean to repel anyone at all.

If I am not in control I get agitated, anxiety ridden, hyper vigilant, panicked and fearful. In turn I lash out as the PTSD makes me hypervigilant about avoiding things that terrify me. I do not do it to be abusive or mean to others. It is fear based and I have intense guilt for being this way. I have a huge phobia of illness, death and dying. I saw my mom dying in a hospital bed of stage 4 lung cancer. Shortly after that my husband was diagnosed with cancer and soon after that my stepdad died of stage 4 lung cancer. On top of that I am a burn survivor who spent over a month in the burn ward ICU. I have health anxiety so if I even feel a pain in my body I fear it is cancer or a terminal illness.

Since my mom died I have become very agoraphobic and have a phobia of beds. The last vision I see in my head is of my mom laying in the hospital bed jaundiced, and helpless and I couldn't do anything to save her. Ever since she died I cannot lay down at all on a bed or even a couch. If I do, I have waves of panic wash over me or I have night terrors where I scream and cry hysterically in my sleep and wake up panicking. I am afraid of going to sleep. Most times out of shear exhaustion I pass out in my chair for an hour or two per day.

I sleep sitting up in my computer chair with my head on my desk. Been doing this for 4 1/2 years. This has taken such a toll on my health that I have weeping edema and severe swelling in my legs. I stopped leaving the house and barely walk around or have any physical exercise. Finally my body probably could not take all the water retention in my legs and ankles and sores appeared and opened up causing weeping ulcers on the front and back of my left leg. The ulcers got infected badly.

After seeing the illnesses of my loved ones, I am extremely phobic of doctors, hospitals and medical procedures. My biggest fear is that I am going to get told I have a terminal illness. I had no choice but to ask my adult daughter to take me to the Emergency room. Now I am so bad I always joke that even if the house was on fire I wouldn't leave it. My home is my safe space and I panic if I have to go somewhere. In the car on the way there I was crying, panicking, shaking and wanting to ditch going to the hospital.

My daughter was getting really frustrated with my behavior and started yelling at me which sent me into a downward spiral. When we got into the waiting room it was packed and I just wanted to run out and get back home. I was talking to my daughter loudly in the ER waiting room without realizing it because I was really spooked. When my anxiety flairs up I talk loud and non-stop. She got mad and walked out and said I was being too noisy and that it was obnoxious. She took the keys to my car and left me there. I was running after her out the door into the parking lot screaming to give me my car keys back. Then security came out and I humiliated her and myself.

I ended up grabbing my keys from her hand and she called her younger sister to pick her up and she abandoned me even though I apologized for being irrational and not being able to regulate my emotions. I was beyond frightened and felt the need to be in control of everything to quell my anxiety. When they called my name in the ER I humiliated myself by having a panic attack and crying hysterically. I was shaking like a leaf and was sobbing and started choking on the air while I was trying to breathe which made loud audible gasping sounds followed by hyperventilation. Everyone was looking at me and I was embarrassed.

Turns out I got infected leg ulcers on my leg and they had to keep me there for days which was the worst thing for someone like me. They were so packed that I was placed on a rolling stretcher in the hallway for 6 hours and left there. Cots were lined up in the hallway that were filled with people waiting for rooms. It looked like a war zone out of a military movie. I kept getting up to pace because beds or laying down makes me get flashbacks of the image of my mom dying in her hospital bed.

One of the staff members angrily told me to be quiet and sit down. It triggered me and I went into a rage and a  blind panic. I refused to sit still on the bed and kept getting off of it and walking myself with my rolling drip pole IV up and down the hallway. My flight response was going off and my body was shaking from cortisol and adrenaline. To stop me from getting off the cot because they couldn't watch me at all times, they set up something that would make a loud siren go off if I got out of the bed. Every time I would get up it would go off really loudly like a fire engine or cop car siren. It made me even more panicked. When it would go off the staff would yell at me to be quiet and lay down which made my panic even worse.

The medical personal on that shift were getting very ticked off and it only made me want to get out of there even more. I was told if this kept up they would throw me in a psych ward which is another one of my phobias. When the doctor finally came over with a nurse the minute he touched me I had another full blown panic attack. I told them of my panic disorder, anxiety, PTSD and agoraphobia history and they tried their best to be nicer to me. I am also a SA Survivor so I was sobbing and shaking and trembling from terror. I do not like people touching me and being vulnerable makes me worse. No amount of sedative's they gave me could calm me down. It was like I was a feral beast. A savage and a wild animal. I feel bad for my behavior and actions. I never meant to be difficult.

Every day that I had stay there it felt like something out of horror movie. I could not lay in that bed at all. I could not sleep at all and finally the nurse squirt some morphine into my wrist and motioned me to lay on the bed to make sure I was pretty much knocked out. After days of captivity and feeling imprisoned I am even more fearful of medical procedures. I was told I need to see a vascular specialist to see what is causing my illness and my sore can take up to a year to heal. Meaning I need to go to a wound care center several times a week to clean and change my bandages. This is holy hell!!

But some days, that feels hard to believe.

There are moments when my trauma seems to hijack everything—my perception of situations, conversations, even my dreams. It shows up in my body, in my inner monologue, and in how I speak to others. It colors how I see the world and how I show up in it.

And I start to wonder... if I’m the sky the storm passes through, isn’t it still the storm that shapes the landscape? Isn’t it the storm that causes ripple effects in the environment? The storm creates change, it moves things. It’s what makes things feel real through interaction, relationship, impact.

So what does that mean for me? Is my trauma the storm, or am I becoming the storm itself?

I think I’m learning that I’m the witness to it. I’m not untouched by it. I carry its aftershocks, but I’m also the one who’s been here through all of it. I’m not just the parts that are reacting or hurting. I’m also the one who’s noticing, questioning, surviving.

Maybe I’m not my trauma. But, I am the one who lived it, and is still here—trying, feeling, and healing.

1m8tfqt,My past still haunts me.,"Hi I am a male(23)and I'm going to tell you parts of my life story. When I was around 9 years old, my mom introduced me to this girl who was about 2 years older than I was, and both of our moms had known each other for a long time. Apparently, I remember when my mom was on the phone with her one day; I vividly remember her sounding very acquainted with this woman whom I've never met a day in my life, even though I was only 9 at the time and the only people I knew the most at the time were my family. My mom and her mom ended up introducing us, and at first I thought I had made a lifelong friend and a childhood rival. Everything was so positive and energetic between us. We were great friends; we would play so much together, and one day… it… finally happened. You’re probably wondering what “it” means, so I’m going to tell you exactly what I’m talking about. Usually when you reach a certain age, such as 16 or 18, you most likely end up having your first sexual experience with another teen during that time period of your life, and for me that was not the case. At the age of 9, this girl whom I befriended touched me in a place she had never touched me up until that moment. Usually it was a hug or a punch on the shoulder whenever we were roughhousing, but this touch felt different, and it made me feel different. She would come over to my house a lot as kids, and that particular touch I mentioned happened more frequently, and the next thing I know, I'm touching her in the same way. When you are the age I was at the time usually for kids they’re very impressionable they pick up on behaviors very easily and quickly and that’s exactly what I did and what I’m about to say now I’m always afraid to say this part of the story because I’m afraid of being looked at differently by my peers , but shortly after I ended up doing the exact same thing that happened to me to my brother I had ended up sexually assaulting him as well and right now at the age of 23 years old I look back at that and I still haven’t forgiven myself for that and me and my brother we are the best of friends right now and I made a promise to myself at this age that I will always protect him no matter what and we have an amazing relationship but I feel like as if right now I will always hate myself for that . As the years went on, the lasting effects from this became difficult to navigate. When I entered my adolescent years, I discovered pornography, which turned into a very bad addiction that I still struggle with, by the way, and it became a way for me to calm down these physical feelings that I had been feeling years prior. I was really hypersexual as a teenager, and that only affected so many other things growing up. As I look back, I can definitely see patterns of where I, who was once abused, had become the abuser in a way. As high school continued, I found myself liking girls who were two or three years younger than I was, but I was on one side of the coin at first. Throughout high school, I felt trapped because no girl in my actual grade liked me at all, which forced me to talk to and pursue girls that were a little younger than I was, but eventually I went from one side of this coin I was on to the other side because I actually ended up forming genuine bonds with them, and so throughout high school, I found my sense of belonging in regard to romantic and sexual needs as well as the desire for companionship. I actually never ended up having sex with any of these girls. I did, in fact, end up losing my virginity when I was 18 to an ex that was a year younger than I was. I look back at high school as well as I did with my childhood, and I feel like a creep at times because I did talk to younger girls in high school. Things get darker in this story. When I was 18 going on 19, I ended up getting in trouble with this girl's mom because she was 14 and she liked me. She had a genuine crush on me. I never slept with this girl; I want to make that clear, but we did flirt, and her mom found out about it, and she told me off, which I guess was a wake-up call for me because at that point it felt like maybe there was something wrong with me. I used to have this bus driver who had this gay son that I’m older than, and one day he told me about his feelings towards me, and my intrusive thoughts decided to mess with my head one day and liked the idea of that. It gave me a genital response to that and everything, and then one day when I was 21 and he was 15, he texted me and told me that he wanted to have sex with him, and I told him that we can’t do that and that was wrong, and he got mad at me. At first he was really persistent on trying to get me to have sex with him, but eventually he got the message, and we hadn’t talked at all after that. I recently broke up with someone that I knew back in high school, and I had liked her since high school. She was 16 and I was 18, and even stuff like that makes me feel like a creep at times, and as you can see, I have a dark past, but now I feel really conflicted. In the year 2023, I started attending this college in Raleigh, and so far I’ve made great friends and established some good relationships, and they always tell me what a great person I am, and the truth is, for the past few years I’ve been doing things like going to therapy to help me get the help that I need for a lot of stuff that I’m going through, but the past is the past, and the people at school who tell me I’m a great person and a friend don’t really know the half of it, and while these positive affirmations I receive from them are great, I can’t help but feel like a fraud at times. So far this is my life story, and hopefully one day if my mental health has improved, I hope to write about how my life is going, but if I’m being honest, not a day goes by where I don’t think about killing myself because I feel like a terrible human being at times, and the most noble thing a terrible human being can do is to end  themselves, to cast out the darkness with the light, to restore the balance perhaps.",1753430861.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd

It was hard to deal with flashbacks at 9 (my parents didn't take me to a therapist or gp till i was 13🙃) were horrible.
My dad had a heart attack and blamed me whilst he actively had it and rolling around in pain. 

Not only did i go through that..after he came home a week after the heart attack, he started being abusive. I escaped this year from my parents abusive ways. I'm in a refuge now and I'm struggling..
I tend to freeze at arguments, bangs, even someone knocking on my room door makes me panic. I won't go out much, nor tell people i don't feel well. 
Ontop of everything, i have a ton of health issues..and they are so fuckin confusing. I hardly tell anyone here because my parents always bullied me about my health and manipulated me..

I have sat in my room once, and calmly tried to end my l*fe because of my parents. And i went to the hospital with a straight face, not even crying. They didn't believe me, till i had three seizures..
I'm still struggling with the flashbacks..i usually have auditory hallucinations of my dad screaming. And i do miss my parents..its just a really fucked up situation. 
I've had friends think I am faking.
I once had a flashback at school due to a ambulance being parked outside. One minute I'm seeing my dad on the floor and his screams,the next I'm laid in the medical room we had in school.

Not everyone knows I have PTSD and I really try to mask it.

My partner is going to be moving into a studio apartment by herself for a job, probably for at least a year minimum but no more than 2 years.  I want to help her get it setup in such a way that it can be comfortable for her without investing too much money (given shes leaving in such a short time span).  When it gets back she can get bouts of paranoia, see things in mirrors, and just be super on edge. 

I was planning to setup a smart light system for her so that if she has night terrors she can turn on all the lights in her studio with the press of a button (I'd place these in different areas of her studio so its easily accessible).  Also to help with the seattle gloom I'd set up a ""wake cycle"" that lets all the lights slowly brigthen on days when the sun isnt up.  Also setting up a temeperature control system with a portable AC she's buying so that she can sleep at a comfortable temperature.

But I was wondering if theres anything else I can do or get preemptively before I visit her to help.  We haven't found a specific apartment yet (shes touring right now), but it'll likely be a studio thats under 300sqft (she prefers smaller) in a quiet and safe area.

I think his friend (also a vet) and I talked him down from the ledge, and he's not alone right now. We reached out to his friend and he's staying by his side. But I'm afraid that he's going to spiral again and hurt himself if something doesn't change. He is sick of going to therapy once a week. He's been spiraling since my parents' divorce. I think he's using again. And last time we got him 5150'ed, he just said all the right things to get out and then held a grudge for a while, getting aggressive and shutting us all out. I don't think hospitalization would help unless I can convince him to choose it for himself because no one has ever been able to force him to talk not on his own terms

I'm so afraid for him. He's calmed down a bit now, but I don't know how long that will last or if next time will be worse or if this episode is even over.

Hi, I’m in my mid-20s and recently started trauma therapy. I’m only now beginning to realize how much I’ve been through in a short time.

About two years ago, I was sexually assaulted. Not long after, I entered a toxic, emotionally manipulative relationship that broke me down completely. I ended up getting pregnant, had to undergo surgery, and made the painful decision to have an abortion — all while my partner became colder and more emotionally abusive. I felt utterly alone.

Since then, I’ve had panic attacks, nightmares, deep shame, and disconnection from my body. Some days I feel like I’m drowning in pain, other days I feel nothing at all. I’m trying to process everything now, but it feels so overwhelming. My therapist is currently on vacation, and I just wish I had someone to talk to who truly understands this kind of pain.

Have any of you gone through something similar — where it wasn’t just one trauma, but a combination of many things collapsing at once? How did you begin to feel like yourself again? How did you stop seeing everyone as a threat, especially someone you love?

I would be really grateful to hear your stories or advice. Just to feel a little less alone with all of this.

1m7h70i,A joke left me traumatised,"When I was a kid, I got into some argument with my parents. I think I didn't want to eat my dinner or something stupid, so I put on a big show - packing a suitcase full of pajamas and storming out the door, claiming I was leaving home. As I stepped out of the door, my brother (who I looked up to as my hero) laughed and said ""Bye!"" Before locking the door. I made it to the gate before the realisation hit me. They abandoned me. I lashed out, did something stupid and they abandoned me. They didn't come after me. They didn't raise an objection, they just... let me go. I broke down into tears and ran back to the house, slamming on the door to be let back inside. I remember crying into my mother's arms as they laughed at me. Every fucking one of them were laughing at me.

Fast forward to now. I'm in my 20s, intermittent depression and near-chronic anxiety. I am convinced that there is something fundamentally wrong with me. Something that means I'm unworthy of love and only a bad decision away from losing them again. I've convinced myself that the only to make them love me and to feel whole again is to make something amazing - be it a novel, animation, game, drawing, whatever. 

This has not gone well. I've burned out. I've spent months on-end trying to find the problem, the fundamental defect, in myself so I can finally stomach the tediums of animation, game development, drawing, etc. I didn't find one. I'm sitting here, desperate to fix the problem, and I don't even know why. 

When that event happened in childhood, it fundamentally warped how I saw myself. I was the disposable one. I was the one nobody would miss. I convinced myself that, in order to prevent them leaving, I had to cut my corners. I had to become meek, apologetic, quiet. I had to say ""sorry"" for the slightest inconvenience, and shrink myself down to accomodate the lives of others. I had to become better, otherwise they'd have no reason to stay with someone like me. I spent years of my life trying to become this prodigy, this smart guy, this ***genius***, only for the slightest failure to send me back into feeling like a retard. I'm a weak, stupid, cowardly, clumsy defect. In therapy, it feels like my therapist doesn't understand how it feels. I don't *like* doing this. I don't like desperately trying to fix things. I want to be happy, I want to like myself, but what is there to like? Every aspect of me, even the somewhat good stuff, is tainted and awful. I'm a monster. How can I like myself when my own family were comfortable letting me go?

I know that's not what really happened. I know that, in reality, a stupid kid lashed out and they found it hilarious and decided to make me the butt of the joke. I get that. But part of me doesn't. That part of me that was alone outside felt like I had been discarded, and only let back in on their kindness. I have to prevent myself from being discarded again but the only way I know how is impossibly difficult.

I don’t know how to bring it up, I’ve always generally been pretty bad with my words and tend to freeze up when I’m put on the spot even when I know I have something I want to speak up about.

They hit us at 70 mph, they hit the passenger side (where I was sitting). >!If our car was just 2 feet ahead, my feet would have been crushed. Anymore I believe I would have died. After I realized I was not dead, I thought my seatbelt cut through my stomach to my guts. Words cannot describe how scary that was. After I left the car, I ran all the way home, my parents were on the way. Apparently, they were yelling at me but I couldn’t hear them.!<

Although stupid, I did not go to the doctor afterwards. I don’t think my parents had the money for it, and I thought the pain would be over soon. I believe I got both a concussion and minor brain damage >!as I hit my head on the window (which left me bleeding).!< I suffer from chronic pain due to the crash.

It was hell being a car afterwards, I couldn’t sit in the front seat for around a month after. It took me a year to relearn being on my phone in a car (as I had to have my eyes on the road unless I would freak out.) after the crash. 

I learnt how to drive in the time, it was hell. I hate driving, especially since to get out my neighborhood, you have to got through the crash site. I really try to stay calm when driving, but the seat digs into my back. That makes me think about the crash so it freaks me out more. I sweat too so I have to have AC on super high. 

During the summer I was learning to drive, family members would tell me to get over my fear. My grandma always told me the story of how she was in a car crash and >!almost miscarried my uncle!< to prove that I’ll ’get over it’ or something. 

I still feel the pit in my gut when in a car, maybe that’s just normal tho. But I can’t watch things with cars, talk about cars (or glass), or play games with driving cars in them. I sweat too much and I feel the same pit. My day gets ruined whenever that happens. So I just avoid cars. While not as bad as before, these fears has transported to fears of other vehicles. 

The pain mostly went away after a few months. But being hit in the back a couple of times made it worse. It went away in the summer, but came back after a girl dropped a water bottle on my back in a stairwell. (She was in one of my classes, I sat next to her. It was hard being so close to her.)

I became very depressed in the winter and asked my mom to put in therapy. She did, and my therapist is very nice. I really like her. 

My therapist specializes in chronic pain. I have shared all of the above to her. I normally go on long rambling rants during sessions. I never end on the first thing I started on. I was talking about lack of empathy of people my age (mid/late teens) about traumatic events, and how I was headcanoned by a friend that something was traumatic for me. I also talked about how I hated that my fears of cars are dismissed by my friends. 

I don’t know exactly what my therapist said, but he said something about PTSD and “if you could not have to go by that entrance, but it take 10 minutes longer. Would you?” (I said yes). She also said a diagnosis could help with treatment plans or something.

During the session I was very much against this idea. In the past I thought I had PTSD from >!incest with my older brother!<, and I was more freaked out more of the time then, then I am now. I am mostly freaked out when I am in pain. I was/am against this idea because it could led to trouble in fostering children in the future. But I have done a lot of research on that, and if I got a PTSD diagnosis, it would not affect my furture as a foster parent.

I know most of my behaviors I have talked about here are not the best. But when I’m not in pain, I’m not thinking about the crash, so I don’t know how to carry on with this. I’m looking to be diagnosed or whatever, I know my mental health isn’t the best. But i honestly don’t know what normal mental health looks like. This all could be normal, but I don’t think it is.",1753344258.0,2,4,ptsd,ptsd

1m7imci,Managing triggers alone.,"Last night I watched a scene in the movie Drop (2025) that triggered a full-on panic attack. In the scene, a woman’s abusive ex kills himself in front of her and their child. For me, it mirrored a real trauma I witnessed someone I loved take their own life, and the shock of that moment still lives in my body.

I broke down completely. Crying. Shaking. Dissociating.

My wife… acted like it didn’t happen. She went to sleep on the couch, said nothing. No acknowledgment. No warmth.

And now I feel twice as shattered not just because of the trauma that got reawakened, but because the person I needed to see me the most didn’t.

I’m trying to make sense of this. How do you regulate when the emotional disconnection from your partner re-triggers the sense of being invisible, unsafe, and alone? How do emotionally intelligent people sit with this kind of pain and still keep showing up—for themselves, and maybe even for their partner?

Any insight, validation, or shared experiences would really help. I have therapy tomorrow, but tonight has been brutal! Literally it’s two am and I am posting for validation she literally ignored my feelings acted like they were crazy!",1753298776.0,8,14,ptsd,ptsd
1m7eob3,Living with the Fear of Abandonment,"I want to share something very important and deeply personal.  
Throughout my childhood, I felt that my mother didn’t truly care about me. Even though she was physically present at home, she was emotionally absent. Like any child, I needed her love, acceptance, and approval, but nothing I did ever seemed to be enough. When I misbehaved, she reacted with anger, when I behaved well, she still seemed upset, asking why I wasn’t like other children.

Eventually I became completely confused. Not knowing what was right or wrong left me with chronic anxiety. Now, as an adult, I realize that the fundamental things a mother should give—love, acceptance, and approval were missing. As a result, I carry a deep fear of abandonment. In important areas of life I’m confident and feel capable, but in social situations I’m terrified of being rejected, and that makes me feel vulnerable.

I push myself to be around people because I genuinely enjoy socializing, yet even small interactions can trigger shyness and a sense of rejection. I overthink everything ,what I did, what I’ll need to do, what others might think and the anxiety is exhausting. I know I can achieve success, money, and a career, I see the steps clearly. But I often lose motivation because I feel alone and abandoned. I even live alone now.

I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone. Feeling abandoned and isolated is one of the most frightening things a person can endure, especially when those feelings are constant. On top of that, you lose the drive to accomplish anything, because why strive for more if there’s no one to take pride in your achievements? A person can survive with the bare minimum and never push for greater things without that sense of connection. Living with constant loneliness and abandonment is incredibly stressful and depressing, and I wanted to share this with someone ,so I wrote this post.",1753289883.0,8,9,ptsd,ptsd
1m7k98u,Im confused with my own anger,"So for context, I have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

I didn’t really notice a significant different before, during, and after. Today, I am having one of my many random days where I suddenly get upset at every move everyone makes. Usually I really like my coworkers and love talking to them, but every few days or weeks, I have moments of insecurity as though I’m being left out and mistreated by people (I know in my head this is not true) and I over analyze every small happening in the worst ways. It starts with the world feeling distant and unreal, then I get a hot pressure on my chest that I can’t get rid of no matter how hard I try.

Everything even seems a bit dim and I alternate between dissociation, anger, paranoia, and guilt for hours. What is going on, am I actually going insane?

1m7tsh3,"Fear of driving, OCD, and a Demo Derby - I Think It Messed Me Up.","Not sure if this is the right group. Sorry if it’s not. I’ve had issues with driving for years. Decades. Fear of accidents - myself and my family. Vivid fantasies of the potential accidents. I -cannot- be a passenger in a car. I have to drive, or I pretty much have panic attacks. I have OCD symptoms pretty bad while driving - continuously blinking my eyes, counting things, etc. 

Well, not thinking of my history and relationship with cars and driving - my family decided to go to a demolition derby. Thought nothing of it. It messed me up and I only stayed 10 minutes. 

Little bumps no problem. But the loud revving, full speed smashing, watching the bodies jolt.. I had to stop watching. It was my fear of car accidents recurring over and over right in front of me. Worst part - one of the cars smashed another and it went over the barrier and almost crushed several people less than 10 feet in front of me. I saw a little girl (student of mine - I’m a teacher…) running for her life in fear. 

I convinced my family to leave the stands and watch from a far. I told my wife I had to leave after that. I couldn’t stay anymore. 

I couldn’t stop shaking for 2 hours. It’s been 4 hours and I still feel dissociative… I don’t feel like I’m here. I have trouble talking. I don’t want to be around anybody. I don’t want to eat. I feel emotionally numb and blunted, I don’t feel anything. I feel consistently tense and on edge.  I’m having trouble sleeping (hence writing this post…) and keep replaying the images in my mind. My drive home was difficult, even though it was only 10 minutes - OCD symptoms worse, driving much slower than normal. Looking at a car makes me feel tense and fearful. 

I apologize if this is not for this group, I feel weird posting it here when I read a few other posts about traumas so much more severe. I feel like this is nothing in comparison. 

But any advice or support would be great. I’m supposed to drive my family across state tomorrow and back the next day to see family. I don’t know if that’s safe with how I feel. I feel like I probably need to talk to a therapist tomorrow if possible. 

What should I do right now? Should I try and push through and go on the trip? Is that a bad idea with my fear of driving plus this new issue? I don’t know, I’m at a loss.

1m7rfuz,How to process grief,"When I was a child I was blindfolded sometimes by an unknown man and made to do things to him and with him. I could only peak so much but I knew what I was looking at was a penis. It happened from being 5 to 10 year old. My dad was absent and addicted to online gaming and didn't notice a lot and barely took care of me. It happen every once in a while. We think it was one of his friends although they don't have a lot of evidence and don't want to tell me because they are afraid I may spiral but from the looks on their faces they have an idea of who it could be (its possible this person may already be in jail for similar crimes but then again they won't tell me but there were hints)

Now here is the part that deals with grief. When I could I'd try to escape to my grandmother's as much as i could. I'd spend weekends as much as I could and tried to do as much as I could with her because I was afraid of being exploited again. She passed away 3 years ago now and I'm 28. But my mom reached out to me to ask if I wanted a piece of furniture that is the other half of one I have already, one she had while I grew up. I'm having a hard time finding a place for it as I live in a small apartment with my partner and it's killing me. I can't stop crying and the thought of losing a piece of the comfort and security I hold so dear as a memory to me of her. She wants to get rid of it and I can't stand the idea of parting with it even if it is at my mom's home in the past. She made me feel so safe when I needed it. The memories mean everything to me so much I had a psychotic episode the day of her funeral and couldn't go because I couldn't process or face the fact she was gone. I don't wanna become a pack rat because of this.

1m7ih1r,Just realized the people who prevented my life from completely sucking are the ones that caused my life to suck in the first place.,"I was emotionally kidnapped and basically had Stockholm Syndrome towards my Grandparents. I threw my life away because of it.

So don’t really know how to unravel anything right now, I’m just exhausted and just sort of done at this point.

So basically long story short I was raised by my grandparents. I had an abusive mother and my dad fought for custody of me throughout my childhood up until I was a teenager. It was a whole mess and sometimes I lived with my biological mom, my grandmother on my mom side, etc. Multiple people fought custody over me but ultimately my biological mother relinquished custody of me and left me on the side of the curb.

I continued to live with them after that. My dad tried taking custody but failed and I didn’t see him for a year after that. And then things continued on until my grandmother died back in 2012, and my dad took me from there and wouldn’t let me see my grandpa.

My grandpa died not long after and that was it. I didn’t see my mom’s side of the family for over a decade after that. The entire saga of my childhood left me with an anxiety disorder at 15 and PTSD plus whatever other bullshit at 18.

I loved them with all my heart, and dedicated everything to them. Living a free happy life, following my dreams because I know they would want me to be happy. I would tell everyone I know about them, how much I loved them, how kind and loving they were and how we were happy even with us living low income and then disabled as my grandparents. I was afraid of everyone else because I didnt want them to take me away from them. I called them mom and dad and we were just a small little family, just the three of us. I felt nothing but love, but that love was just twisted, like a case of Stockholm Syndrome. 

In addition of alienating me from the rest of my family, my grandparents couldn’t care for me correctly. They didn’t teach me much about caring for myself, defending myself, etc. I was absent from school often and we didn’t have money for much so I’ve been taken in cabs when my appendix ruptured, etc. I didn’t have glasses until I was in my second year of high school when I needed them when I was in 8th grade. We couldn’t afford it. But everyone else in the family had more than enough money and would have immediately bought it for me.

I also told my grandmother how my cousin on my grandfather’s side sexually abused me from 6 years old. (At least I think I told her, things are fuzzy) She didn’t say anything about it. I think she was afraid of our family being ruined. So things just never happened until they died.

I was afraid of my mom’s side of the family. I missed everything celebrating my graduation with them, my first job, accomplishments, etc. and now everyone is having children and getting married and I’m just disconnected from everything. 

It’s so absurd it’s hilarious. The people I loved the most and lived for, the people that everything about me revolves around me are the people that hurt me the most. The people I felt the safest around were the people making me the most unsafe. The people I’ve had the happiest memories with. It’s comedy gold isn’t it?

I don’t know what to do with this information. I loved them and still do. Should I just start hating them? I don’t know. I’m already 28. I lived past everything I would have enjoyed with my family. It’s just too late now. The only happy memories I have from my childhood just seems twisted and dark. I held on so hard to it all for hope and fought for my dreams because of it.

1m6xs8t,Nurse practitioner diagnosed me with PTSD but therapist disagrees,"I have had my therapist for many years. Recently I went to a nurse practitioner as I suspected I may have ADHD. They asked me to fill out some additional evaluation forms, including PTSD. My diagnosis turned out to be anxiety, depression, ADHD and PTSD.

I was a bit confused about PTSD, but it made sense because I could never get past my hyper vigilance after growing up witnessing my parents’ physically abusive marriage. I later thought of other experiences I had such as being molested by a medical professional when I was a teen, and in my adulthood I experienced something that bordered on sexual assault, as well as physical assault from a stranger. Also in my adulthood, I experienced manipulation and betrayal in relationships.

My therapist was very surprised by the PTSD diagnosis. She made a face when I was describing my diagnosis, and then said “why PTSD? Because of your dad?” Then she went on to say how cptsd isn’t recognized by dsm but it should be, and that “we all have some form of cpstd.”

The NP prescribed zoloft saying it also treats PTSD. But my therapist thought it was odd because I was on lexapro for a year and she felt I should be getting treatment for ADHD instead of another SSRI. My therapist also suggested I take supplements for anxiety. 

I am really confused by the contradictory advice and not sure how to proceed- whether to get another opinion from a different psychiatrist or is my therapist in the wrong for her skepticism?",1753238524.0,21,63,ptsd,ptsd

I see a therapist and I learn about myself and my trauma responses. I made a list on the notes app of behaviors that are a result of my trauma, and another list of my normal behaviors. This helped me build self-awareness and understand who I really am.

I also allow myself to feel emotions—even the painful ones. I cry when I need to, and I don’t avoid my feelings; I process them. I learn to understand emotions and how they feel in my body so I can express myself better and manage them in a healthy way. This helps me avoid feeling overwhelmed or stuck or unsure of what I’m actually feeling.

I joined group therapy to educate myself and connect with others who have been through similar things. Connection is very important in trauma recovery because trauma made me hate people and isolate myself. But connecting with others helped me restore trust and realize that there is still goodness in people—not everyone is bad.

I also journal my thoughts using a journal app. I practice breathing exercises where I inhale, hold it for 4 seconds, and exhale slowly for 7 seconds.

I use positive affirmations too. I say out loud “I let go of the trauma. I let go of the people who hurt me.” I do this to release the trauma from my body and grow out of it. I repeat it every day, as often as I can—and it really helps.

I also use drawing, painting, design, crafts, and learning piano to stay focused on the present moment. Creating something makes me feel proud of myself.

All of these practices have helped me heal from long-term trauma. I still continue do them, and I’m giving myself another year to feel fully secure in myself.

Remember to trust the process. Healing takes time, but it will work out.

I really hope this helps someone out there.

1m6ym8a,I can’t stop the flashbacks or questioning if I was even abused. I feel confused and don’t know how to get closure,"I am 25 years old now. I find myself more than often with unable to cope with the fact I was groomed at 13 years old by a man that was 25 at the time for 5 years. The older I’ve gotten the more it hits me how messed up the entire situation was. He took my innocence away and part of my childhood. I was a teen who thought I knew everything. I made up lies my parents believed or I snuck around like most teens try to do in ways. No adult was paying attention or stepped up.  We are both artists in the same city now. When I was young I loved art and he was an artist. We bonded over art. I admired him for showing me a “life” I couldn’t imagine yet at such a young age so it seemed like a ton of fun and new expierences. he was the first man in my life to give me attention or “love”. This man who groomed me snuck me out of my house almost every single night and had sex with me. If he wasn’t doing that he was sneaking me around on “dates” making me feel “special”. For almost over 5 years. Now I know I was not special, but at the time I was so young with no adult expierence & believed I knew everything. So I thought I was special too and he just saw something in me others did not. Obviously he was taking advantage of me. He emotionally and physically abused me constantly. The older I got the more “cold” he got towards me. I was 18/19 when things really went down hill, I was feeling a lot starting to make more sense that didn’t before, but I couldn’t grasp the thought yet. Slowly things fell apart. I ended up sleeping with one of his friends after we broke up a month later. I was 19 at the time I slept with his friend. I thought giving my body to someone was a way to connect with people since that was the only way I was shown love for years. I now would never do that to a partner. I was on drugs, so confused, scared, realizing I was taken advantage of (it was and is a slow process to accept and see what REALLY happened) and lost. I feel so much pain for my younger self and it really screwed up my perception of love and relationships up until I was about 22. When my abuser found out I slept with his friend after breaking up, he made me feel like the worst person in the world. Not even acknowledging he took advantage of me for years. I was made the villain. I struggled with drug abuse for years after. I could not cope with all the betrayal in my life from a young age (not to go into detail but I’ve had lots of traumatic expierences but this by far has affected me the most almost daily), but this severely sticks out in my mind every single day what happened to me for years by this person. It makes me sick knowing how much pain and agony I went / go thru over this while he just lives his life and nobody even knows what he did to me. I am 2 years sober now. I love my life now, but  at the same time I can’t stop repeating the painful moments of my younger self. I feel a wound that will not close in my heart over this. My entire life I feel has been smeared permanently in some sense. I can’t help but blame myself or feel like it was my fault. I feel as if I am trapped with having very deep hatred with the person who abused me along with a loyalty. Maybe even somewhat “Stockholm’s syndrome” unsure how to describe it honestly even almost a decade later.  I am proud of who I am today. I just see myself making so many foward steps then I have flashbacks daily that really do affect me. I look at myself today and don’t recognize the girl I was 6 years ago, but I carry her pain with me. I have never spoke out against my abuser publicly. Some Family members and friends are aware of what’s happened. Knowing we are both in the art community in our city I sometimes see his face and my body freezes. Sometimes I really wish I would just let him know how badly he destroyed a piece of me, but what if that is satisfying to him? I also think, what if allowing myself to express how badly he fucked me up would give ME closure? I’m just unsure if addressing an abuser helps the actual victim. I want to let him know what a POS he is and that he can’t tear me down. I want to look him in the eyes and tell him what he did while holding my head high. Sometimes I fantasize about that moment even if it never comes. I feel silenced for years. We have 0 contact since I was 19.

1m6veat,Anyone else get extreme physical symptoms?,"Hi all, 

I have had ptsd diagnosed since 2021, although I believe I actually have cptsd (proper traumatic childhood and multiple other traumatic events from 2019-2023.. lucky me!) 

I had something happen a few days ago which triggered what I believe to be a ptsd response but it was so severe I’m quite shaken by it. 

I get vomiting when ptsd flares up, but the other night I was throwing up every 10-20 minutes for about 9 hours straight. My skin felt sore to touch, couldn’t sleep for more than 5 minutes at a time, heart RACING, pacing, diarrhoea, dizziness and extreme crying spells/panic attacks. 

I’ve never had it this severe before, and I’m really upset as lately, I’ve been feeling a lot stronger with managing my ptsd. It’s totally understandable why I was triggered though, the circumstances would make anyone freak let alone someone with history like mine… but still… 

Has anyone else got similar troubles with the physical issues of having ptsd? If so, what do you find helps you manage these symptoms most? 

At the moment, the only things I’ve tried that works (most of the time) is: 
•PRN medication- promethazine hydrochloride (although this didn’t work the other night, ended up throwing them back up) 
•breathing work 
•mental grounding via maladaptive daydreaming (this also rarely works, as I’ll just start daydreaming about what’s triggered me, ending in flashbacks) 

Thank you everyone ♥️",1753231733.0,5,9,ptsd,ptsd
1m6uz17,Suffering from short term memory loss?,"You are probably wondering why did I add “?” In the title this is because i don’t know what happened. ( excuse my English it’s my 3rd language)

This all started in 2004 i was in my 2nd grade and my very small town got terrorist attack by Al Qaeda. I was in school with my sister we heard gunshots that sounded like fireworks. We all thought it was fireworks including the teachers. Then the teachers received phone calls and they all vanished leaving a school with more than 500 students with only 3 teachers and the principal. Some parents were able to come in and take their kids in my case my dad was working in a company that had it own terrorist attack and my mom gave birth the day before and was sleeping in with the baby. 

I remember praying in the main hall with senior students they were all crying, me and my sister didn’t even know what terrorist means?. I remember eating kit Katt for free because the lunch lady was crying scared for us. I also remember that we were lined in queue for the bus and i was the 4th student to go to the bus then my memory shattered i just remember going back to school for no reason.

We stayed in school for total of 12 hours until my uncle was able to come and get us. We didn’t go to school for 3 days but during these 3 days i was constantly having weird dreams, in my dream i was the 4th student to go to the bus and saw a dead body being dragged down with a rob tied to a car with people laughing like joker and the bus driver yelled at us to get out of the bus and we went back to school i cried because of the yelling i don’t think my brain registered what i saw. They also throw Molotov cocktail at a tree in our backyard and the teachers were able to extinguish. 

When we went back to school everyone was talking about the dead body that was tied to the car so i know it happened and i saw the burned tree so that happened too. Something in my brain tells me none of that happened that it was just a dream i asked everyone about the tree they told me they didn’t see it catch fire ! I don’t personally know the 3 students who were in the bus with me to ask them. I know for sure that i was in  a bus and i know i was yelled at to get off the bus but i don’t know if i saw the body.

I know traumatic events can leads to memory loss when i ask people say they don’t remember a lot of things it happened in 2004 ",1753230529.0,4,2,ptsd,ptsd
1m6uwrj,Medical Trauma Help,"I’m now 24, but was 8 years old I went through medical trauma that I’ve been unable to recover from. 

My pediatrician forcibly held me down and plugged my nose to complete a strep test after I told him I was nervous about it. This specific experience mixed with some other poor dentistry experience has led to an adulthood of being distrusting of medical professionals. 

I know my basic health and hygiene is important, and I do my best to do so outside of doctor’s and dentists visits. I know my medical care is important not to neglect, but due to my past care I haven’t been able to find anything that helps. 

I’ve explored three therapists including exposure therapy. Prior to medical visits I’ve been prescribed drugs to take the night before, the morning of, or both before my appointments. I’ve tried the nitro gas, laughing gas (I’m not sure if those are the same or similar), valium, and xanax. These drugs work the night before, but do not counteract the anxiety the morning of or during the appointment whatsoever. Most of my appointments end up being canceled/rescheduled due to the fact that I can’t calm down within the time needed to complete the procedure. The most recent time at a dentist appointment I was trying sedation for  the first time. I finally thought I find dentist that was going to be conscious of my trauma and anxieties. Regular filling appointments have always been a nightmare for me, but this time I was freaking out before they could even administer the IV and decided we couldn’t go forward that day. 

I’m worried about my bodies health, but don’t know what to do. My closest family and friends just tell me “It’s apart of life, something you just have to do” and “it’s only a small pinch and it’s over before you know it”. I know their words carry truth, but it doesn’t help in the slightest. No one in my circle has been able to empathize or understand with what I’ve been through and go through still today. 

I want to explore EMDR, but am looking for other potential suggestions and maybe some others who deal with this. <3",1753230349.0,3,3,ptsd,ptsd
1m6kquh,CBT - How to tell a therapist you don’t want to do it?,"I live in a rural community and the only therapist I can see is sponsored by the county. For some reason they are all religious and push that on their clients, even when you say that you are not religious and you don’t want to participate in Christian worldviews. I don’t want someone who will think that I am not “fulfilled” because I don’t follow their religion.

I was in therapy for an eating disorder when I was younger and they were okay, but he just kind of danced around all of the other issues that I brought up and his main goal was to get me to eat in public again because that’s what my mom was paying for. I don’t remember all this bullshit about healing my inner child, I told one therapist that I forgave my abusers and that it “is what it is” and that wasn’t good enough for her, because rationalizing is a “trauma response” even though they say they want you to “think rationally”.

I’m just so fucking tired of going through all these people only to have the same fucking result over and over. I had one therapist that was amazing and this organization was terrible to her and made her leave. I don’t want to try more meds that aren’t going to work, I don’t want to heal some stupid imaginary little girl that isn’t my responsibility, it was my parents. I want the therapist to teach me how to communicate and cope, not look in a mirror and tell myself shit I don’t believe. ",1753206166.0,13,23,ptsd,ptsd
1m72iyd,C-PTSD from health problems and lost time (Warning: triggers of suicide),"I was born in 1989 in Northern California. I never had the best childhood. I never had true friends and was sickly a lot of the time, but my two main life goals were and are to go to medical school and become a doctor, as well as become a chess grandmaster, which I was fully on the road to getting the requirements for and would become one by perhaps age 19-21. However, at age 17, my physical and mental health fell to the floor. I lost half of my whole body weight and was at many points at the brink of being institutionalised.

During my 20s, I was constantly having suicide ideation. I also had this sickening chronic feeling of nausea/queasiness that irked me to no end 24/7, a side-effect of the health problems. I thought to myself,

*I am not fulfilling my goals, I can barely eat food, every f\*\*king day, every hour, every minute, every second I feel like throwing up, I have no friends. Why live?*

Throughout my 20s, I lost so much weight that my weight fell sharply from 85 kg (187 lb) to lower than 50 kg (110 lb). My BMI was hovering between 14-15.

At age 32, I found out that everyone whom I thought were friends were backstabbers. My so-called 'friends' treated me worse than fiends. My so-called 'best-friend' blamed most of their life problems on me and cut off all contact. Knowing these things, I disowned every single person whom I met from school, university and chess. I became a hermit.

At age 33, I was officially diagnosed with autism.

Now, I am almost turning 36. Only recently have both my mental and physical health gotten better. I am even applying to medical schools in Europe and getting out of this country this year and am planning my comeback to serious semi-professional chess to get the GM title.

However, there is one thing that irks me greatly more than many other things: coping with the fact that between the ages of 17-35, I was as good as dead. I might as well have been a vegetable lying in bed. I lost my whole 20s. This hurts me greatly that thinking about it makes me want to throw up and pass out. It saddens me and irks me so much that my extreme insomnia gets even more extreme. The memories of spending my 20s, the supposedly best years of one's life, laying around at home, stuck, doing nothing, fulfilling NONE of my goals when my peers were becoming doctors and chess grandmasters (and in some cases both at the same time), sickened me so much that I am honestly surprised that I had not committed suicide by overdose in my 20s.

It is so stark that I often feel like I am a 17-year-old, yet somehow physically in an almost 36-year-old's body. It feels otherworldly, as if I am living a nightmare movie, except that this is real life. The world that I know it is 2006; the fact that it is 2025 is beyond shocking to me. I feel like I have been timewarped through one of those wormhole things in theoretical physics. In my mind, it seems like my brain tells me, 'It will be 2007, then I will turn 18'.

But...it is July 2025. This 'lost time' thing goes through my mind tens of thousands of times daily. I keep thinking about how ages 17-35 were lost, like I were in a coma. Except, someone in a coma perhaps would not feel the physical sickening symptoms that I had throughout my 20s. I even wished that I were in a coma. At least since I have a DNR, I could be taken off life support.

Does anyone have anything akin to what I went through, and if so, how did you cope with this lost 'life' time and get back to your goals and what you were doing before this almighty collapse?",1753254471.0,1,3,ptsd,ptsd
1m6ts1k,I feel unsafe in my hometown post SA,"Just over 2 years ago I experienced SA by a girl who I thought was my friend. I prefer not to go into detail, but it happened in a shower cubicle near a swimming pool. Ever since then I feel like I'm unable to go outside in my hometown. My school didn't do much to help me when I told them, all they did was move us into different classes (this was counter-intuitive considering they sat her in the desk next to me during one of my gcse exams, which I left half unanswered because I was shaking so much I couldn't write). Now that I'm not in school and will be going to a different sixth form for safety, even going outside feels like I'm gambling between a normal day and possibly running into her. It has disturbed me so much that every time I go out I have recurring nightmares about the incident. I've also been travelling to visit my Mum, who lives across the country, and every time we've gone out to the local town centre I feel a lot safer. Unfortunately, moving in with her fully isn't an option, but I wish I could. I can't even go near swimming pools or smell pool chlorine without shaking, and sometimes it's difficult to shower without feeling physically sick, which is bad enough. Actually stepping foot outside my home is like the anticipation to a jumpscare in a horror film, except the jumpscare leaves me feeling physically ill and crying for hours. I just need to get this off my chest, I think all the stress from seeing her in exams has made things even worse, and I've only recently been referred to a psychiatrist since I can now organise my own doctors appointments.",1753227307.0,5,12,ptsd,ptsd

I said okay sure, when’s the next appointment. He said end of May. I collected my gasted flabbers as quickly as I could and said “Fuck you, by then I will be off of them and would have to start all over again.” He said he was sorry but there was nothing he could do. So I was forced to go cold turkey off of my medications and tried desperately to attack the problems with diet, exercise and meditation. It didn’t work.

I have been experiencing suicidal ideation for months now, but it has grown to the point where it feels like an urge and not just wanting to die. The last time this happened was June 2018 and I felt compelled to commit suicide. I felt like I was in a trance. I pulled into oncoming traffic as a semi came barreling down the road. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath and told myself it would be over soon…but the fucker laid on his horn, screamed at me and flipped me off which was like a splash of cold water on my face and snapped me out of it. I swerved out of the way at the last minute and threw up from nerves. Feeling this compulsion again terrifies me.

Now I’m on day 2 of leave from my job per my therapist’s urging, out of sick time for another day off, with an appointment with a psychiatrist for tomorrow morning to get on medications again that will realistically take 4-12 weeks to fully take effect. My therapist urged me to take FMLA but I am the only income in my household with 2 kids and pets that rely on me to provide for them. I looked into it and it will take months to get approved for paid leave through the state and while my employer provides paid leave, that will take time and be subject to approval too.

I legitimately am so scared, I don’t know what to do. In a perfect world I could just go on leave and still take care of my family, but millions of homeless people with severe PTSD tells me I’m one of the lucky ones in this fucked up world we live in. I feel my only choice is to go to work tomorrow, go to my appointment and hope that because I was very transparent with my team at work that it will be okay while I wait for the medications to kick in and just pray it is smooth with minimal side effects. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I hate this and I hate myself and feel powerless.",1753204867.0,3,2,ptsd,ptsd
1m6h4o7,Am I alone in feeling like we don’t get the support from our husbands and family,"So, I’m newly married (one year in August) and got diagnosed in January with Complex and severe PTSD. When I met my husband I already was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder and on sick leave. With the new diagnosis I’m now declared incapable of going to work ever because I can’t deal with the stress of it all, so I’m home almost all the time. I started working out and taking walks in nature cause it helps in the morning but apparently I’m not giving my husband, who’s an introvert and works from home, enough space. My husband still expects me to function normally in the house. Take care of the kids, the house, pay some of the bills and is asking me to go out one night a week (when we are alone) for like 4-5 hours at the time, knowing full well that I’m not always capable of doing it. The expectation is for me to still meet his needs even though I’m not making much money to go out, don’t really have friends to hangout with and sometimes just can’t bring myself to move, let alone go out. I feel like he doesn’t understand what I’m going through and the work I’m putting in to heal and be a better person with all the scars and issues. I feel very isolated and being told that if I don’t meet the need our relationship is probably not going to work is stressing me out. I was willing to make the effort and go out for an hour or two but apparently it’s not enough. Why is life so hard all the time!!!!",1753198066.0,3,18,ptsd,ptsd
1m6gd8y,Lost my partner due to PTSD,"So this is a sticky one me (F23) and my fiancé (M21) had been together for almost 3 years. When we met I had been struggling with a very abusive and manipulative ex relationship where I was both mentally and physically abused and ended up getting diagnosed with PTSD. When I met my fiancé he was super understanding of what I went through and was willing to support me through it, however somewhere among the 6 month mark my PTSD symptoms and issues started popping up and interfering with our relationship, usually he would do something that would trigger me and he wouldn't understand why I was upset with him and I would have difficulty explaining it to him. But we kept moving on with the relationship and got engaged around the 12 month mark because we fit together like a glove besides the trauma, and I started seeing a therapist albeit not often due to NHS. However we split for about 3 days just after our 24 month anniversary because he started feeling doubt that I wouldn't get better and he started fearing the relationship would break down, so out of panic he ended things and we got back together after the 3 day mark. We then spent a further 4 months together and my issues had gotten way way better and it certainly wasn't as bad as it was. Unfortunately an argument happened because he didn't communicate with me very well when he went out with some work friends who I didn't know and ultimately we split again and he was very upset and hurt and felt like he doesn't deserve to be exposed to my trauma or be treated like that.

We had been separated for almost a week and we finally saw each other in person and gave each other closure, he admitted to me he wants it to work and he still cares and loves me so much, but he just wants to be away from everyone because he's still angry and has some resentment towards me and he doesn't want it to blow up in my face and he do something he regrets or further hurts me.

Now I am here, I have agreed to go no contact with him and he said he will eventually talk to me again and we can build everything back up on trust from both sides and I have joined a bunch of support groups that I regularly see and getting one to one therapy sessions from them but its not infinite it only lasts a certain amount of months or years I believe.

I suppose I'm making this post to see if anyone has had a similar situation, maybe they lost a partner to PTSD, trauma, drug or alcohol abuse etc. How did you cope with it? Does my relationship situation seem salvageable? Does no contact work? And any advice would be greatly appreciated <3",1753196371.0,4,5,ptsd,ptsd

1m6fyec,Therapy Recovery Help,"I recently started going to therapy for anxiety and burnout due to a traumatic event that happened 2 years ago that includes >!sa, attempted kidnapping, then attempted murder!< in a foreign country. I was also laid off from my job 2 weeks after so I wasn't able to get treatment or help even after getting a new one a month later. 

At my second session last week, my therapist had me tell her in detail what happened from beginning to end for over an hour and exactly how I was feeling at every moment. 

I tried my best not to think about what happened over the last 2 years and this completely broke me wide open. 

After leaving the session, I sat in my car for an hour and cried. All week I've had severe panic to the point I've taken 4 days off work and haven't been able to really eat or function. I will just sit frozen on the couch staring at the wall for hours. I've never had any mental health related issues be so physical and I'm at a loss of what to do. 

I upped my rexulti last night after talking to my psyc and that seems to have helped a bit today but I'm still having issues and suppose to go on vacation this thursday, which is ironically the first time I've traveled since the initial incident.

1m64ah3,Was it SA or was I just uncomfortable?,"For context, I am 15 years old right now and at the time i was 14 and my (now ex) boyfriend was 15.

We were hanging out with two of his girl friends, and at one point he asked me if we wanted to go his room to hang out there, I said sure. When I got into the room, he called one of his friends and told her to lock the door from outside and to only unlock it when he calls her on the phone. She did so, and we started kissing. He went to take my shirt off, and I was clearly physically uncomfortable and had told him I don't really want to. He kept insisting, but I didn't want to anyways. Then he tried to lift up my shirt as I was moving away on the bed because I was clearly physically uncomfortable as I told him and didn't wanna do it and also refused multiple times. He said ""just relax"" multiple times and he slid up under my shirt and started doing some things that shouldn't be said on the internet. I froze at the moment because I was scared and in shock. I was shaking the whole time because I wanted him to stop but he didn't. After 20ish minutes of him doing all kinds of stuff to me, he finally stopped and let me go. I was still in complete shock, so I just rushed home without barely saying anything. I cried for hours when I got home. For the next 10 days, I was trying to find out on the internet if it was SA and I got mixed answers, mostly negative ones from men because I didn't ""physically push him away"". I felt so depressed, I was constantly crying and harming myself, I didn't shower, brush my teeth, change my clothes or even leave my bed.

1m6cs9c,Communicating Anger to Loved One with PTSD,"I have a loved one with military related PTSD. They function well except when they don’t. Specifically, they have a lot of free- floating anger that gets stirred up when they’re in pain or in an anxiety- provoking situation. At that point they become petty, bitchy, blow up over the most minor things; they also will make fun of/ criticize me in the presence of others. They’re deliberately mean and hurtful ; that’s the only way to describe it. It’s almost like possession by a different, malevolent personality, like Jekyll and Hyde. 

When they snap out of one of these episodes, they say things  like, “Just tell me I’m being an asshole.” But of course I can’t tell them that when they’re uncontrollably angry. I can’t cry, because then I get piled on for that. If I try to defend myself, my loved one gets angrier. If I say I’m sorry , they just dismiss it with, “  No, you’re not.” 

I’m not in great health, and the stress of anticipating another one of these rages is not helping my condition. I’m afraid one day I’ll just stroke out or have a heart attack.

June of this year, I was physically assaulted at work. I was kicked in the face by a patient. Without giving too many details away, let's just say I have involved lawyers and I am out of work on workers comp. I was trying to help the patient... But he had some psych stuff going on and he kicked me with malicious intent and knocked me out. And I almost choked to death from my own blood. 

I guess I just need to vent. 

I tried to return to work and only lasted about a week. 

I got diagnosed with PTSD by my psych NP and physician. 

Seeing some of these other posts, I am identifying with the content: I don't trust anyone anymore. 

I used to be the happy-go-lucky nurse... I used to truly care about my patients and listen to them. Level with them. Make jokes with them. I went above and beyond for them. You might think ... ""Doesn't every nurse do that?"" And no... They don't. Some nurses don't give 2 fucks about you. But I loved taking care of other people. 

But every time I try to imagine going back to work... And work with patients... I freeze. I get overwhelmed with fear. I don't see a patient... I see a threat.  

I see the shark eyes of that guy who kicked me. 

I have therapists and doctors on board. I just need to ""recover"" mentally. 

I'm just not sure if I can ever come back from this.

The 3 year anniversary of my dad’s death is coming up this week. It was very traumatic for me and resulted in me having to do cpr on him. I was doing okay for 6ish months, then the flashbacks all started coming back. But, not just flashbacks of this specific event. I was in the first responder/medical field for years before this happened. Now I’m finding myself having flashbacks of my dad along with any other traumatic code that I’ve had to run where they seem to all be morphing together? It’s causing me to spiral and need panic meds more often over the last few weeks and I’m feeling like I’ve gotten so far only to go backwards.

1m612uf,learning to live with myself,"sometimes i am so tired of having ptsd. my therapist has always said it was chronic, but i guess the coined term has become complex, and that’s accurate too.

and regardless of my background with it, knowing that it affects literally every aspect of everything that i am can be infuriating. i mean, i can’t catch a break, because my entire thought process - even down to things that seem basic - are so maintained and complicated by the way my trauma has formed my mind that there’s nothing to do but live with myself. 

so, i’m living with myself. i’m going to be 29 soon and i’m still alive. i’m beyond proud of this, and other things. i sit here covered in balls of tissues, crying over old words that aren’t mine playing back to me in my head. this is all after an activating and similar experience brought them back to life on a casual monday night after work, in the home that i comfortably and lovingly share with my partner.

we had a disagreement. to them, telling them how something i said “could be interpreted by others” as a wary “fyi” was really meant to be a statement of “this made me feel bad and hurt my feelings.” but then my trauma steps in.

every god damn thing is a trauma response about me. i know this sometimes. i know this always, actually, but it’s mostly left unrecognized in the moments i need to see this the most because i’m activated, triggered, or whatever your word you use could be. i’m too charged to process the fact that a chord was struck and is now reverberating within my mind.

i’m sitting here like, somewhere in my subconscious, “oh shit - something i said could land wrong. i hate when i’m not seen as how i’m trying to be: fair, decent, understanding, and considerate.” and i know who didn’t think, and certainly didn’t want me to think, that i was anything good at all and that there was nothing good out there for me. so my mind goes that way. to keep me safe, to keep me in what my mind thinks it understands, it takes me down the familiar road. it wants me to defend myself: so i civilly try to address the perceived threat without even knowing it.

it was just a monday where we were going to watch tv and drink some fizzy soda, the gut-healthy kind. it was just a monday after a long week last week. i started to go south on myself with my thoughts becoming unkind when my partner did, both of us becoming irate and my “questioning” making it worse. but i was confused too, and i just wanted to know why they’d said they’d told me how they felt about something when all i heard was how i had done something wrong. i asked them what they felt, and they told me i didn’t listen and became upset.  they’d told me that i knew how they felt, and i hadn’t listened to them. i’d hung onto every word, so i felt even more activated by this.

coming down, i realize that their statement - out of a lack of understanding of their own feelings - was geared towards how i said what i said without use of any straightforward words to tell me literally how they’re feeling. it wasn’t an “i” or “me” or “my” sort of sentence. they didn’t say “i feel hurt” but instead said something like “what you just said could make someone feel hurt.” and to me, that’s a “here’s what you did wrong. you did an objective wrong. because you’re the problem. because it’s objectively this way, it’s foolproof.” and i didn’t even know that i took it that way. it was a simple misunderstanding on how what was said to me wasn’t literally what was felt, but was supposed to allude to what was felt adequately enough to address it. but because i survived what i lived through, my brain identified a threat.

i know now that my question of clarification was healthy and good, even while i didn’t know the reasoning behind it. an unclear allusion versus what i expected to have heard when they referred to having shared their feelings were very different. and my continued need and drive to ascertain and be told that i didn’t do something wrong and to overstate and justify actions that didn’t need justifying was frustrating. it led to a blowout argument from a partner that doesn’t have the mind i live with each day. i wondered why my partner told me they had told me how they’d felt when they’d said nothing about themselves but only identified something i did wrong. they couldn’t see this, but neither could i. i tried to convey what i didn’t understand, just like they had - and we both failed to be understood, which is our mutually shared activating experience thanks to our upbringings.

i cried. we both freaked out in our own ways, got upset, calmed down, talked, misunderstood each other more, argued, etc. but this is success! this is understanding, giving myself grace, being kind when i mess up, being proud of myself for knowing that i beat the dead horse because i was triggered. my nervous system was activated as hell and fought for me the best it knew how even though it didn’t have to. i recognized my activation, my emotions, my reactions, my concerns, and ultimately the pattern. i learned and can do better by myself and my partner next time.

yeah, living with myself is hard. i think it’s the hardest thing that i do. and i do it every damn day. i’m proud of that. today, i hurt and i fought and i succeeded. today, i understand myself better. it’s never going to be easy, but it’s definitely worth it. i hope that makes sense - i hope i wrote this in a way that can accurately describe and reflect how tough it can be to be so activated and triggered over something so simple that turned into something so, so big just to realize its that trauma brain doing it again. learning and coping and being understanding helps to keep it from going so far and happening so much. i did it, and i’m proud of myself. and it was identified so much sooner this time too.

i’m going through stuff outside of home that makes me hyper-vigilant lately, so all-around i’ve been more on the lookout (subconsciously) for “scary stuff” that could maybe be threats. but i rewired my brain a little bit tonight just by recognizing that there’s no threat and that everything is okay. i healed a little bit tonight. it was exhausting, and the next time will be a little less intense. and my partner and i will apologize, hug each other, and keep going.

people who don’t get it may never understand this, but to those of us who do, keep going. you can do it. it really, actually does get easier. and it definitely gets better.",1753147665.0,1,6,ptsd,ptsd

I have been sexually abused(never raped, important for the story) as a child and probably also groomed(as a big part of it was ""do you love me? Then do it for me"" and ""if you like me you won't tell""). I don't remember it much, as I suppressed the memories and I have had some memories from it come back. I was hypersexual, as a result, as a child, but I also loathed him after(thoughh at the time of the abuse I didn't know it was wrong, I felt it wasn't okay). It was never acknowledged much by my parents(who know of it, but I dont remember to what extend they knew what happened). My symptoms didn't worsen till I was older(like 12/13?) at which point I started having panic and anxiety attacks, paired with flashbacks(the anxiety attacks weren't related to the trauma, though I have had anxiety because of it). But as a child, I remember not wanting to go to the room alone, which has improved since.

 I don't have many panic attacks, but when I do, they're terrible, I shake, sometimes cry, I have flashbacks and sense of impending doom, I'm not able to tell the time nor the reality from the flashbacks. I hate touching, and this can also be a trigger for me(mainly after I tell them to stop but they don't or when I don't anticipate it). It also evokes a lot of anger and fear in me and I sometimes lash out on them, even physically before I can process it. I have also(probably?) had depression at the time and insomnia/hypersomnia and struggled with sh. I reached out to a psychologist , unfortunately not a good one. I came there because of the trauma and my responses to it(to which my parents reacted as ""it wasn't that bad, get over it) and because after the depression I buried it in me, which made me feel no emotions. She never even asked me about the trauma and focused on the behavior, also she didn't believe me when I said I can't feel the emotions I could before, so I quit therapy saying I was better. Later, I've had depressive episodes(?) mostly lasting a few weeks to months. 

Now(18), at my worst, my symptoms worsen a lot. I have terrible nightmares(always had, but not always) nowadays, they tie to the trauma, but also are lucid, and when I try to wake up from the dream but I can't. My dreams are(and always were) either boring normal stuff or they can also be violent(not really tied to the trauma but I guess dreaming of murders, killing someone etc. Isn't exactly normal). Since then, my mother bacame ill with cancer, which ofc impacts my mood. When she became worse, I again had a depressive episode(not a one time thing, its always a thing of shes done with her treatment, then they find it again, then it spreads etc). At these times, sometimes paired with overall school stress and stuff, I get more nightmares, more attacks of both kinds and all that. My issue is, that I don't experience these things regularly but they depend a lot on other factors. I am hyper vigilant(I scan for touches, at class I prefer to sit in the back with at least one wall covering me...) and avoidant(as I mentioned) all the time, I also think about it/have intrusive thoughts of it basically daily. During the last kind of episode(from the last winter through spring), I became addicted to nicotine, as that's the only thing that made me relaxed at least for a while. I would be nauseous, so while alcohol ""helped"" too, drinking wasn't really enjoyable(and now I'm glad for that). I wasn't as depressed as anxious though, probably because someone had to be the ""strong one"" and my dad who usually shared this position with me also became kind of depressed at the time(moms cancer spreading). 

Again, I'm not in a position to go get a qualified opinion(as even with the first psychologist it wasn't taken well by my family I can't imagine asking for it again, and with the shortage of good psychologists I fear it would end up as the last time). I'm from a conservative area/family and it was always about everyone having their problems and dealing when them on their own(and again ""it wasnt that bad""). I have nowhere to turn with this and google can only take you so far. ",1753118463.0,1,2,ptsd,ptsd
1m5j4ik,I can still feel their hands on me.,"TW: S/A Trauma

Its been over a year now. I've been fine and actually quite happy as of late. Everything has been going well for me & I thought I was over it. I was aware that healing isn't linear and I have gotten a few setbacks here and there but from what I know, it's normal to feel so.

So me and my friends were at a hangout and somehow, the news of my ex had been brought up. I could not tell them at the moment but every mention of my ex's name along with the update of his life somehow made me sick to my stomach.

I tried putting up a smile to my friends because they were all joking around but hearing my ex's name and how he's been doing... I wanted to just. I feel like I've reverted all my progress. How is it easy for him? and why is it so hard to deal with this? I feel his hands on me, I replay the scene over and over in my head, I've been scared of so many things because of it, and I can't even deal with the mention of his name or his life. 

I really wish this was easier. I can't believe I have to deal with this my whole life. I can't believe theres no cure or no way to move on from this & all I have to do is learn to deal with it. My god. How happy my life is.. and it gets ruined because of this. ",1753105030.0,1,1,ptsd,ptsd

I’m looking for some honest insights or experiences from anyone here who has come across the *Lasting Change Book* or seen any lasting change book reviews. I’m interested in approaches that focus on small, manageable habit changes and personalized wellness routines.

Living with PTSD, I find it challenging to maintain consistency with self-care and habits, so I’m curious if this book or similar habit building tools have helped others in our community. If you’ve read it or followed reviews and found anything useful, or if certain aspects didn’t work for you, I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts.

No pressure to promote, just hoping to gather peer perspectives to see if this might be a helpful resource for me or others here.

I feel lost and burnt out during these days for having nothing to do and am constantly beating myself up for being unproductive. I will ask this week for more days to work at one of my jobs that may be willing to give more hours. Large portion of this is being made fun of and emotionally abused by my parents and older sister all my life since I was born. I am stuck here until I graduate and get a full-time job in Accounting since I can’t dorm with roommates currently due to personal reasons.  

It is literally the summer. I do have hobbies like caring for hot pepper plants, duolingo, and working out, but each of these takes 15 minutes out of my day max. The rest is just spent ruminating about my past traumas and addictions and why I’m unproductive and not prepared for future job prospects out of college.",1753070985.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd
1m5crsb,Feeling lost and empty,"I was a victim of online grooming growing up, started at age 14 and kept going until my mid 17s when I realized what was going on and managed to escape those situations. I had multiple groomers throughout the years, some asked me for pictures of videos, some were nice to get me into this sense of security, some only did it so they could blackmail me with my own pictures so I would have send them more, I witnessed so many victims just like me fall under the same manipulation and I wasn't able to stop them because I fell for it too at the moment, I even witnessed a friend I made in that area of the internet not be able to handle her depression along what was happening around her, and from what I know she killed herself 4 years ago.

My brain constantly comes back to those memories, whenever I masturbate the climax reminds me of the videos I recorded, and I feel dirty every time; whenever I have sex I almost always end up crying either during the act or after it, I've managed to scare hookups and even partners that way; my paranoia constantly haunts me and I have this feeling that every friend I have is secretly trying to get me to send them nudes so they can blackmail me with them; I feel like my partners just want to get information out of me so they can dox me and use that for blackmailing aswell; when I look at certain social media apps the notifications of those groomers' dms do not leave my mind; I crave for physical touch, but whenever I recieve it I am scared that the person doing it will reach into my private parts; I never sleep next to anyone, even a partner, because I'm afraid that they'll kill me because ""I know too much""

These thoughts have been haunting me for years, and just know those thoughts are coming back; I feel like those groomers will find me, I feel like I'm being chased by them without my knowledge; I'm scared of my boyfriend because I feel like he wants to abuse me; I'm afraid of my friends and think they just want to use me without my consent; it's nearly 2am and I'm scared of falling asleep because I feel like someone will break into my apartment and kill me with the knife I have in my kitchen; I'm afraid I'll be kidnapped and killed, and no one will hear from me again; the thoughts are getting louder and I'm not able to tell if what's around me is real or not

I just need some help, any tips to calm down. I had a therapist 2 years ago but her methods she gave me only make me have a headache every time I try it

Hope you are well?


Currently recovering from PTSD which is all fine and dandy. However my memory is completely messed up, to the point where yesterday feels like the incident happened. So basically what caused this occurred in 2022. 

The problem is - I have no recollection of memories from 2022 to present. I know I did exist - due to my journal entries. 

The problem now is - my memory is seriously making me double step backwards. For instance I have issues with remembering new information, or finding myself like oh my gosh did I take my medication (currently recovering from an illness) I noticed that the memory issues doesn't affect deadlines or work. But everything else in between is conked up. To the point where I find myself doing something I have already done.

1m53d2j,"Need help understanding myself and my PTSD better. (Trigger warning, brief mentions of: Sexual Assault, Self Harm, Suicidal Tendencies)","As I said above, that’s what I need. I’m a 15 year old girl. I’ve been diagnosed when I was 14. Unfortunately I cannot get proper mental help. My parents.. yeah. Anyway. It’s REALLY bad. And I hate to resort to this, but this is better than nothing. As I mentioned in the warnings, my PTSD is mainly from the fact that’s I’ve been SA’d. I tried to end my life at 7 years old for unrelated reasons and I had been manipulated into believing I was a bad person (I did nothing. Won’t get into that long story.) and so on. I learned so far that PTSD can affect memory, and logical thinking as it messed with the higher thinking part of the brain. And your amygdala and hippocampus (the alarms) grow more active. Now here’s the problem: I get triggered VERY easily, a bit severely, and I don’t understand triggers a lot. For example, if I’m outside and I feel someone behind me. Depending how initially distressed / upset I am (let’s say I’m feeling uncomfortable or overstimulated or whatever) and that happens. A bigger trigger is when I see for example vent videos without proper warnings. (Happens a lot). But nothing compares to when they though my SA’er to my class at the last semester of my year. Sometimes, in cases like this I grow so distressed that i intentionally try to make myself pass out or even die to lose consciousness and escape the situation. Other times I’ll start crying in bed. A while baxk I had this horrible experience of feeling hands all over me, even in places I was never approached in the first place. Traumatic nightmares happen to me sometimes too, and were the first sign for me to start suspecting that I’m not okay. I really want advice and help, I can’t keep living like this. Every time I think oh I’m healed another thing happens to remind me I’m not. I’m really really in a bad state and I could put myself in danger if I get triggered badly enough.

1m4quln,"Has anyone with ptsd received treatment for ADHD symptoms caused by ptsd, and has it helped?","How’s it going, combat vet with PTSD here. I started receiving care for ptsd in 2014, and applied and received a VA rating for it in 2020. Early on dealing with the VA I was put on medications to help with issues I had with ptsd. They tried a couple different meds and each time my mental health plummeted and I didn’t want to be here anymore. I stopped seeking medical treatment, I would rather have problems and be alive for my family. Over the last couple years my wife and I have noticed symptoms similar to her son who has severe ADHD, (I’ve been in his life for 8 of his 11 years, he’s my boy and I only say “her” son because his ADHD did not come from me, his father was treated for it before he passed away). I have been digging deeper into the symptoms and found that people with ptsd have a higher risk of developing ADHD. 

I have seen the benefits that Ritalin has given to my boy, his grades have gone up, he’s having better relationships with friends, his chores are generally done in a timely manner, and he generally seems happier. 

I want to talk with my provider about things that can be done to try to combat this. I have been attempting to change my habits to include more lists so I don’t forget tasks or processes, bedtime habits to make sure I sleep enough, exercising, changing my diet, and quite a bit more. It always seems to help for a while, but while I continue with those new techniques, I start to slip somewhere else, or start to notice more problems. 

Has anyone had any experience with taking medication for ADHD brought on by ptsd? I have seen firsthand how beneficial it can be for some, but with my prior bad experiences, I’m nervous about even bringing it up. I don’t want to keep feeling like my brain is failing me, but I don’t want to end up in the same depression that almost had me take my life 10 years ago.

1m4jcgq,How can I support my bf who almost lost his life in an accident,"Xmas day 2024 by boyfriend was in an accident. He was driving to his parents to get us some Xmas food when his truck hydroplaned, flipped over twice and ended upside under water. He had to struggle greatly to unhook himself from his seatbelt while being upside down underwater hanging from the seatbelt. Miraculously his driver window busted out during the flips so he was able to pull himself out through the window. He walked away from that near fatal crash with only a cut on his head and elbow and a bruise on his hip. For all intents and purposes he shouldn’t have survived but he did. It’s slowly coming to the surface that he is not dealing with this at all even though I constantly check in (I have CPTSD so I have tools to help him somewhat) But our relationship has taken bit of a toll over the last 6 months and after a discussion this evening it’s pretty clear the accident is affecting him more than he wants to admit. And I feel horrible because he tells me he’s ok and I’m very patient and supportive even though our otherwise perfect and stable relationship has felt like it’s slowly wilting. But it’s because he’s masking greatly and after talking more I found out he’s pretty much having flashbacks daily. And it doesn’t help that he works 45 mins away and has to pass the site of the crash everyday. I love him dearly and I’m doing the best I can with the tools I have and he and I both know therapy would help, and I think it’s inevitable at this point. But is there anything more I can do? He also deals with a lot of guilt because had I come with him that day I would have definitely been killed with how the truck crumbled, I would not have been able to get out. It seems like that bothers him so much more at times and it’s terrifying for me to even think about it because I most definitely would have died. I’m pushing hard for him to get therapy because it’s not only our relationship struggling his boss and friends also notice the shift. I just want to support him as best as I can, he’s the love of my life and a good man and it hurts my heart to see him struggling. And the masking and acting like everything is fine when his actions feel like he’s pulling away from me has taken a toll on me, I understand now and can and will adjust my expectations and he shows me so much love in so many ways. But I got close to breaking up with him because his actions had become so confusing and it was triggering old relationship wounds. I just wish I could make things better, he says he has flashbacks almost daily. The night time is the worst as well as driving, which he has to do daily.

Actually any noise will wake me but it’s mostly planes. Lately I’ve adopted a kind of new “hobby” known as prepping. It’s where you stockpile large quantities of food and make numerous preparations for worst case scenarios for those who are unfamiliar. I’ve found that (for me) I feel I’ve adopted an unnatural obsession towards this “hobby” to the point that I feel as through my only route to feeling safety is through being prepared. I’m not certain but i believe it’s defiantly correlated to trauma. I’m a 23F who spends her day researching the best price for 25lbs uncooked beans and watching videos on youtube of homesteading and gun safety.

As you known the world has wars and I've endured one of them. I don't know if it's severe but. I'm just 14 but now I think of rockets as a war rocket and not a space rocket. Everytime I hear whistling I immediately think it's a plane or a rocket. Been in a situation on a new year, heard fireworks and started almost panicking because they reminded me of bombing. Everytime I hear a loud sound I flinch no matter what it is. I think I also may have depression. But maybe I'm just overreacting. I was half asleep once and heard a plane outside, my dream shifted from a peaceful one to a war one. I also forgot what it is to have 'normal' nightmares. Because no matter what it is, a nightmare always shifts into a war one where I hear bombing, see bombing, or die because of it.

1m4a6pv,I can't stop feeling like my trauma wasn't that bad,"TW: Emotional abuse.

Hey all, first time on this subreddit so sorry if this isn't the right kind of post. I've been struggling a lot recently with feeling like none of my trauma was anything that bad and it just won't stop playing on my mind. I keep beating myself up thinking I should stop blowing things out of proportion, and then the next minute I feel defensive and start catastrophizing. I just want to run through the basics of my childhood so I can get things a little straight in my head.

Before I was four, my mother and I lived near my dad, who was very psychologically abusive to her. He'd sneak into the house in the middle of the night, verbally torment her, etc. I vaguely remember him holding her by the neck when I was a kid. He would also physically intimidate me, and was very neglectful. My earliest memories are of him being passed out on drugs while I'd crawl around the house in the dark, not having eaten. When I was around three, he took me to his mother's house (also a severely abusive person) and they locked me in a small room for a day or so while I begged to be let out.

After this, we ran away from him and went to live near my grandmother, who was an emotional rock for us. But my mother was very mentally ill. She'd burst into tears, fly into rages where she'd throw things off the wall and threaten to hurt me and my young sister, scream at us and call us names. She told me twice that she hated me before I was 7, and while she didn't intentionally hurt me more than once, she would do so by accident out of stress. Out of rage she'd make violent threats and once held a knife up at me. Her tempter was hair trigger and she'd break down biweekly, and developed a problem with alcohol that meant she wasn't there for us emotionally. I had to be there for my sister when she was most panicked. The alcohol also caused her to talk about a lot of inappropriate things with my sister and I at very young ages - when I was nine she told me details of a sexual assault she'd experienced, and this still causes me problems with intimacy. What stays with me the most is that I couldn't be there for my sister properly. I was so checked out and suicidal for so many years that I just wasn't able to be emotionally present in the ways she needed. I'd wake up to her screaming 'sorry', with our mother mocking her voice back at her in a rage, and I'd just stay frozen in bed. She's ok now, and we have a good relationship, but I'm not sure I can forgive myself for it.

Despite all this, I knew our mother loved me on some level, and my grandmother was generally very emotionally supportive (though she did dismiss my mother's emotionally abusive behaviours). The two of them supported me academically and did everything they could to get me to unviersity. They praised my talents and I love them both very much.

Nobody needs to respond to this post of course. I just need to get these thoughts and memories out so that I can start to get a handle on how difficult my childhood was. Because of the positives, I can't help but minimize the trauma and abuse, even though I have all the hallmark symptoms of CPTSD. It just keeps going round my head and I don't know what to do.",1752967693.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd

This is hard for me to talk about and I’m having a hard time even putting into words and like everything traumatic that happens to me, I don’t want to talk about it and dig even more into it, I just try to bury it in the back of my mind till I stop thinking about it.
This happens almost a month ago and unfortunately the guy involved is a coworker and I see him almost everyday walking around like nothing is wrong . 
Let’s call this guy 🪳 

I really don’t even know where to start. So please bear with me as this will come off not that well thought out. The conclusion is that he tried to get me to murder someone…

I pick him up in a parking lot, he bought 2 of those tiny buzz balls for me and I drink. We chat, he wants to smoke and I say no bc I didn’t want to swap salivas with him.

This guy is repulsive. I only hung out with him bc… well the reasons aren’t important here. But I never planned to do anything with him. I just was planning on having a good time, doing some dumb harmless flirting.

Anyways, we’re chatting and I want to drink more so say let’s go to the store. I say I can drive and he says no and that I’m too drunk (makes me do line walking test)—-this detail will be important so please keep it in mind. 

We walk to the store, I get a small bottle of hpnotiq and we go back to the parking lot and I drink it all and I still remember things. I guess this is when I start to black out bc in my hospital report it said that he said I had two of those bottles and I remember only buying one. 

Anyways I wake up in the morning in the hospital 

I find out I had driven my car 5 blocks which is close to his house, crashed it in a tree, and popped my tire. And from what he said I kissed him and gave him head and wanted to get on top of him for more which he said he pushed me off. I also pissed my pants which is not like me no matter how drunk I get, this only happened one other time when I know for a fact I was drugged. 

I’m very against drinking and driving. Even when I offered to drive after my 2 buzzballs, it was very unlike me just like how I decided to hangout with him. I was going through some stuff and was feeling very desperate.

Keep in mind. He didn’t drink as much as me at all. He had like one white claw. 

I thank god every day even tho I don’t believe in him for not killing anyone. 

So tell me why a guy who wouldn’t let me drive while having only 2 buzzballs, let me drive after a 4th drink? And please tell me how to navigate work when I know he has twisted everything since everyone seems to be buddy buddy with him while I’m seething with rage? I guess it’s work but fuck it’s aggravating seeing him. 

The only thing keeping me sane and not on the news for an overkill is my future and my insane amount of belief in karma. 

Really quickly, I know he did have sex with me too. It’s so weird bc a few hours later when I was relaxing, I felt this soreness in my vagina and throat. But it only lasted for like 5 minutes and it was very faint like it almost something  trying to tell me something. I will be getting checked out soon…. 

Maybe im overthinking like i always do but god this is taking a toll on me since i lost so much bc of that night.

1m3ykeh,PTSD from medical trauma,"TW for chronic illness

Don't know if to label this vent or advice. Kind of both I guess.

I have cPTSD from sexual trauma and neglect in childhood/adolescence. Then, when I was ~24-27 years old, I was very sick with ME/CFS. It turned out to be a side effect of Mirtazapine, which I took for chronic pain and disordered sleep mostly. ALL of the ME symptoms went away when I stopped taking the medication. I have since slowly recovered from how unfit I became in those years. Even the chronic pain (headache) basically vanished since eye surgery.

I have not, however, recovered from all the horrendous gaslighting from doctors and friends. Every time I get sick or have unexplainable symptoms that are similar to back then, I spiral. I avoid doctors as much as possible, ignore any kind of symptom as long as possible and still get really overwhelmed with memories of those years. I was an ambulatory wheelchair user to manage the fatigue, and basically my life would have went quite differently if it hadn't been for this illness. I probably wouldn't live in this country. I'm really scared to take any kind of medication but I sleep is so bad still.

I'm at a loss at what to do about all this. People don't really understand how horrible it all was. Just be happy it's better now, they say. I can't. Tried talking about it in therapy and getting nowhere. They always suggest there might have been a psychosomatic aspect to the fatigue and I spiral again. I mean there might have been. It's just triggering and takes away any trust I had.

That ended with only getting 2 weeks of therapy, not enough time for a proper diagnosis. I've been an 'Adult' for two years now and I've been dropping the ball on things that should be easy pretty consistently. This has ended up feeding into my already poor self-esteem and my narrative I am just an innate fuck-up. I would like to ask for tips or something to deal with changing this narrative, but I'm pretty sure I already know the answer. This is just something I'm going to have to learn to change within myself. Now that I am aware of the narratives that I am telling myself, It's a choice to continue them. Most of the worst parts of my PTSD have passed for the most part, I haven't been struggling with insomnia as much, the feeling of being watched has become less intense, (though is still remains), and my memories are less intense. I feel myself progressing, slowly shedding the things that have been holding me back. The problem is that sometimes when there is a setback it causes me to spiral to the point where it feels like all my progress was fake, just a lie and I will always be like this. Which is true if I continue to think that way, it is just very confusing that something as simple as a conflict at work can lead me to such a dark place.

Let me start by saying that I honestly am new to the world of PTSD and trauma at all. I (27M) have recently discovered chronic emotional abuse as well as a severe repressed traumatic event in my own life. The break from the abusers came in the last few days, and the recall panic attack was last night. Then came the nightmare I could not wake from. For context, I am dating a partner with severe PTSD from a singular tween event as well as chronic abuse in several forms in adulthood. For privacy purposes, I will leave it at that. I do not normally dream or remember them, but this nightmare I woke up from, certain it was real and jumping out of bed to act. This was a related recreation of that initial event taking place in adulthood where I was then involved to save her. She is not home, but comes home tonight. I do not want to mention the nightmare to her, for sure. I have already decided to seek trauma therapy, but with the weekend have to wait. Any advise if this happens again tonight when she’s home?

I was on of two victims. I carry so many unresolved feelings and therapy hasn't really taken with me. My abuser and the other victim are both dead now. I'm in my 40s now and a husband and father. I spent most of my life as what most would consider a high functioning addict. Though I ultimately added to my trauma bc I am beginning to doubt whether I can do sobriety. And I'm not even fully sober I'm on MAT. I probably would be dead too if I hadn't fallen for music. Playing in bands in front of audiences made me feel alive when I needed to be numb every other moment. I was able to feel in a controlled environment and express myself. I went through a few bands and they all had interventions for me that never took. They didn't know why I couldn't stop, and I lied and always said I was working on it so I could get what I need. I did the same thing with my family but as my son got older I realized that he deserved more than what I could give him in the state I operated in. My first issue with the sobriety was feeling feelings and nightmares. Prazosin has helped me keep the nightmares from surfacing as potent as they had. My therapist and a friend who knows my past has suggested I return to music and I've tried but I can't. Not even a little bit. I feel it in a way I never had before, just thinking about it bring tears welling up into my eyes and makes me feel everything I can't allow myself to feel. It's too much.

I was always told not to tell mom. He gave me money his dad would give him, and when we got older I asked for more money if I had to put up with that. It finally stopped when he got a girlfriend. I think I was in middle school when it stopped. 

We don’t have a close relationship, I ended up getting committed twice, the first time I was at the end of my senior year. When I got to the mental hospital it was scary, but we all got to know each other and it was a big comfort. Well one night when we were all talking about coping skills, SA came up. And a lot of us were hiding it. We were told that we had to tell our parents as we were minors, my mom freaked out. I don’t really remember what all happened but it never got brought up again.

It’s been over 10 years since then, I’m having a hard time calming down. My partner isn’t being super supportive, he’s trying but it’s actually making it worse so I asked him to just leave and go finish his movie with our friends.

I was doing good until we all watched some movie from 1978, then a few SA scenes came up and it scared me. I sat there trying to be okay, acting nonchalant. But I couldn’t do it and retreated to my room, shaking and bawling my eyes out. I’m collected for now but it’s coming in waves and I feel like I can’t catch my breath. I see it all so vividly and it’s making me sick. I just want to crawl into a hole and beg for it to stop replaying. For the questions to stop. For the worry that it’s what I deserved.

Dying in a crash has become this fixation of mine everytime i’m on the roads because i’m so scared to go through that again and die. And now, someone i went to school with has died in a truck vs car accident. I didn’t know him all that well but we’d hung out and i don’t know why this brought up such emotions for me.

This has been bothering me for the rest of my day/night. I get scared going to work in fear of seeing this person or any other people who look like the other people. It is so hard to deal with and no one except my boss knows I have panic attacks after seeing people who look familiar and I didn’t even want her to know!

Now ive isolated myself from friends and family. Only people in my circle are my wife and dog and that's because we live together. 

I have made it an effort to go do activities with my family every weekend, whether it's festivals, farmers markets, etc. it has been over a year of plastic smiles. Wife has been supportive, but I know it stresses her out so I don't speak up anymore as she just tries harder to snap me out of it. 
I was offered 2 different meds, wellbutrin or Zoloft. I have no idea what to do. I hate meds, I do enjoy a nice bourbon or 2 on the weekends, I interact with clients daily for work.( Worried about alcohol interaction and how people say they exhibit increased suicidal ideations, manic episodes, seizures thresholds)But I did give it the ol college try without meds and I feel this is the only option left.

1m32yjf,From PTSD to a Graduate Degree,"Hi everyone! My name is Amy and I have C-PTSD from extreme child abuse. It's been a difficult ride as you all probably know.  I'm 48 years old and have been in therapy for 40 years. The thing I've struggled with most is terror - can't handle that one well. Though I can handle everything else pretty well.

Anyway, a couple of years ago I went back to college as a coping mechanism to distract myself from fear and it was very helpful. I'm now a senior at Worcester State University, majoring in Biology with a 3.77 GPA. I'm planning to go to WPI for graduate school for a double major in Biotechnology and Artificial Intelligence. It seems I actually have a future.

So I recently began a YouTube video series called From PTSD to a Graduate Degree. In these videos, I discuss what it's like to pursue my education while living with PTSD.

1m3cs0j,"I saw a post on reddit yesterday, it was my ex.","Tw for abuse, su.cide attempt

So a bit of context; this was the first serious relationship Ive ever been in, and possibly the only one. Of course everything started out good, but by about the second half of our relationship, they started acting very toxic toward me. At some point, it got to the point where they turned flat out abusive, and found a sort of enjoyment out of hurting me. Eventually the constant and deliberate pushing of boundaries, s.xual bullying and emotional abuse lead to me making an attempt on my life, and a painful scar in my mind that still hasnt healed. I don't normally have flashbacks anymore, but sometimes someone will say something, and it'll remind me of them, and I get hit with these memories that become so real that I feel like im there again, or like it was only yesterday when everything happened.
So anyways, last night I got on reddit, and the first post I saw was from r/trans, and it was someone talkimg about some stuff, and the way they talked, somehow I knew- and whem I clicked the post, it was their name. The username they used on everything. I've never followed my ex on reddit, it seems crazy to me that out of all the posts that I could've seen, out of all the people on reddit or even just that sub, why them? Like I have a hard enough time being tormented by their ghosts, why do I have to constantly live with remembering what happened while they get to forget and live a normal life? Is it wrong i wish they would stuffer as much as I have the past 2 or three years?
Anyways, I felt this terror for the rest of the night, I felt shaky and my breaths felt heavy.
Im feeling a little bit better now, I keep reminding myself that I'm safe, I'm far, far away from them. But it hurts, it hurts and I dont know how to stop it.",1752869790.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd
1m2yxwo,Shame revolving around sex.,"Kind of looking for advice from people in a similar boat.

I'm a guy, and as a teen I had a lot of instances of sexual assault against me by my partner (female) at the time. Now, being a guy, female on male sexual assault isn't something taken very seriously, which is unfortunate but the reality of the situation. My friends or family who I've told a few times about this really don't care about it. Which is a bit of a double edged sword in a way because if no one acknowledges the problem then the problem isn't there if that makes sense.

I'm 24 now and have been rattling with a few problems. I've had multiple partners since and only on rare occasions have I felt fine afterwards. I'd say 90% of the time, I feel a huge amount of shame and sort of just, disassociate. There's been occasions where I even disassociate during. One of my genuine biggest fears is 'baby trapping'. As a teen who was coerced into doing stuff without protection to keep them happy, possiblity of pregnancy was always shoved in my face afterwards as a sort of fear tactic to keep me around. I have always wanted a Vasectomy since and do wonder if it would make me feel better about the whole ordeal.

Something I have come to realise while I went through university is, that if people persude me for sex while out clubbing or anything, I would just go on autopilot and do what I thought that they wanted me to do. Because it's kind of all I feel like I'm wanted for. Obviously, this has affected my relationship with women, as I sort of view them as predatory, but in an underhanded way. Which logically I know is not the case, as they have no reason to know anything about my experiences and wouldn't recognise me going on autopilot. (In fairness, I sort of just view everyone as predatory, but my particular experiences has shaped a lot of my thoughts around women.)

The thing is, I do enjoy sex, but I also think it brings out the worst in humans. And yet I am a participant. So I'm not sure what that makes me. I'm not asexual, but I do wish that I was so I had no strong feelings towards the subject. 

It's a bit of a weird one. I'm not entirely sure how to actually vocalise the feeling to explain myself better. But I'm sort of just looking for any advice on the subject. I am really having difficulty maintaining relationships because of it, as I either become avoidant, or hypersexual because that's what I believe I'm useful for.

1m2hemo,I was directly told today that I have severe PTSD after months of denial by myself and others. Empowering but bittersweet,"The rape counselor read the DSM-5 to me and contextualized my emotional state while I fiddled with fidget toys on the office couch. I checked off every single thing in the criteria. She said to me directly and bluntly that I have severe PTSD, and there’s no point in denying the fact that I was raped anymore. I was raped. I can’t even type it anymore without tensing up and feeling like I’m dying. I spent the first 6 months of the aftermath floating and brushing the trauma off as “just one of those things”. I have lots of trauma from my dad abandoning me and me being bullied at school, but those things are nothing compared to this. 

I’m home now from the appointment, very tired but still feeling on edge. I couldn’t go to sleep until 4 AM and that was only after playing Tetris for 30 minutes while listening to relaxing frequencies. I have so much pain in my vagina, thighs and legs. The nerves are burning. I startle so easily and all I hear in my head is the sound of me being raped (the noises I was making, the sound of my own bedsheets moving while he moved my body to a position where he could smother me). Jaw hurts, can’t breathe at all, severe nausea. Having to tell myself multiple times a day that I’m safe. Wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. 

It’s been almost 6 months since the bad thing happened and my body’s fully feeling it now. I guess I’m glad that my experience was fully validated after months of self-denial and self-blame. It’s still so hard to accept that the person who did this to me did what he did, because I trusted him. I was truly shocked. I think I’m finally moving out of the denial stage of healing; grieving the person I was. I wish I could feel some physical relief because I have never felt more uncomfortable in my life.

Triggers, SA, Suicide

In 2020 to early 2023 I was in a group of friends who I had met online and lived close enough to be able to hang out in real life, if I was lucky to sneak out enough. It was me, aka Zero, my boyfriend at the time who I'll just call E, who I had dated on and off from 2020-2022, a pair of twins who I'll call Castor and Pollux, and a mutual friend who I'll just call his nickname, Acid.

So Me (trans male), E(M), Castor(M), Pollux(M) and Acid(trans M). Right? We were all early teenagers when we became friends  
Now, heres the plot twist, I guess. I am the only one still alive. 

E, my boyfriend had struggled with thoughts of suicide and SH years before I had known him. He had lost his older brother in early 2022, I think that was his tipping point. He took his own life in October, the day before I had gone to the state fair. I woke up one morning and he was gone. I think that was one of the worst days of my life.

I spent most of my time with Castor and Pollux after that. And when I say most of it, I MEAN it, I practically lived there. I guess Pollux had always taken a liking to me, I think he had a crush on me far before me and E had gotten together. I think a lot of things about him.

I remember every second of when it happened, even when I try not to. I had just gotten out of the shower, a towel was wrapped around me, he had opened the door and told me that we were home alone.

I think I broke his nose, trying to fight him. I remember how bad it hurt when I fell on the slippery tile. He left me there after he was satisfied. I think I stayed on the bathroom floor for hours. Pollux told his brother, boasted about how he had me.

Castor and Pollux died around the same time, maybe a couple months apart, i think. Pollux had gotten bad lung cancer, after smoking almost anything he could get his dirty hands on. He died from it, they found it too late to stop it, I think. Castor took his own life afterwords. After he had tried to get with me as well.

I got close with Acid, I always was, but he was all I had at this point. A long while passed, just me and him. What people would call a situation ship, I guess. He was hit by a drunk driver, and was in a coma for months. He died, a couple days before his birthday. 

I just, don't know what to do, I guess. I feel so empty. So empty besides the hands crawling all over my empty husk of a body. I just needed somewhere to ramble, I guess.

1m2h82d,i quit my job.,"I (f20) have been diagnosed with ptsd for at least one year now, but dealing with it for 2+ years. In May of last year I was put in the mental hospital because of it. before that I tried going off to college, but that’s when my mental health started getting worse for wear. I tried again after the mental hospital, closer to home with support and stability, but I still had a hard time with classes and still failed. So I tried getting a job instead seeing as school wasn’t going to work out for me. I have been working as a kennel tech at an animal hospital for 6 months now, but this job has taken my light from me. I loved helping the animals, but they had me working 10+ hours a day 5 days a week, and sometimes 6 out of the 7 days a week and it blew me over the edge. I didn’t have time to take care of myself anymore and look out for my mental health, so I quit. I feel so guilty over it. I tried turning in a two weeks notice at first but I can’t keep going back there because it takes all my energy and I feel my mental health slipping again, so I told my boss I don’t think I can finish out my notice, but she keeps pretending she didn’t hear what I said. I feel like a horrible person because everyone at work is going to have to pick up my slack. I’m sorry if this is all over the place, I don’t really expect anyone to read this whole thing because I’m just venting, but I just feel like my PTSD has crippled me from trying to move on and start my life as an independent adult. I know I’m in a much better place than I was a year ago, but I feel I’ve hit a wall in my life.

1m2gzan,"problem with remembering clearly things from my childhood. in fact, i think i don’t want them to be true.","i am 24 years old female. i love my dad so much. but in the last few years, some memories, realizations and just something (i can’t even explain what) came to me. i can’t hug him, i am disgusted by some things he does and i just feel something is off. these are the tings from my childhood that i remember (not 100% clearly so i don’t know if this is my broken reality or have i, during years, just suppressed wrong things from life) and stuff that makes me think now, that i was, in some way molested by my father:

1. he was staying with me while i shower until i was like 6-7. i suppose that is okay, since i was the one that had asked him to. but, the thing is that while i was showering, i really liked the feeling of water shower being close to my vagina, and the stream of water going in there…i see that as an early way of pleasing my self, but it was not me that was doing him, but him. he allowed me to do that, and was the one placing the shower there. AS I CAN REMEMBER


2. while we were laying down on couch watching movies for example, i remember telling him that something was itching me down there, and after that i would put my hand down and just started rubbing it, while he never told me nothing and seemed to be perfectly okay with it.


3. when we were on a holiday, as a family (brother, mother, father and i (i think i was about 10 at the moment)), i had some serious problem when entering sea. my vagina was burning so so so bad the moment i stepped into the sea. i couldn’t bare the pain, so i was just spending time at the pool. mother and father seemed to be pretty indifferent with that, so i just ignored it.


4. generally, i have had pretty common burning sensation while peeing. for the record, it continued while also being a teenager, so i don’t think it is that relevant, but whatever.


5. i had no bleeding while having my first sex. i know that it can happen and that it is perfectly okay, but while probably overthinking about everything, can’t help but wonder.


6. he can sometimes mention something about pedophilia, and i just get chills, as one of his jobs is working with children.


7. while i was a teen, i got drunk a few times, and he picked me up from the parties, and he never told my mom about that, or even talked to me about that, to tell me idk hey its really bad to to that. i get myself thinking that it could be because he is afraid that i could in some way say what he was doing or so. i dont know


this is the first time in my life that i have ever put a sign in the world about this and i am really afraid and uncomfortable. i am sorry if it is  bad written, or not suitable for this place, its just i am not ready yet to talk about this with someone, or even know who to talk about. i don’t even know if that is true or not.

He never mentioned it and was always flirty with me. My first instinct was to confront him, but then I asked myself, what would I really gain from that? I want him to apologize. Thinking about it made me reflect on others who have hurt me before. Even though an apology might not fix the damage, I realize I need to hear one. Now, when I think about it, what I really want is for them to feel remorse. Even if they are living happy and fulfilling lives while mine is broken, it would bring me some comfort to know that they feel bad and guilty too. that the pain caused isn’t only mine to carry, but theirs as well.",1752804492.0,1,2,ptsd,ptsd

I despise those people. I've maintained my grudge against them for years. Once, I thought I really deserved spankings, but after encountering the right people and gaining the right knowledge, I realized that all this time, they were brainwashing me into thinking I was a bad child who deserved to be beaten, which made me hate them even more. I've cut contact with them. She used to spank me in my childhood, and the last time she called me, she said, ""Hey, son, why don't you talk to me anymore?"" Oh, all of a sudden, she forgot who she was and decided to behave like an angel now that I've grown up. She still thinks I've forgotten the abuse she inflicted on me. Many people told me that spankings would make me a more well-behaved and grateful person, but for me, it's the opposite. Spankings made me hate my parents even more. I don't owe them anything, and I don't need to be grateful since all they've caused in my life was pain in the name of discipline. I won't forgive those absolutely disgusting, repulsive monsters. I hate them. People like them should never have children because they'll pass down their cycle of abuse by treating children like property.

1m2chkv,Tremors after an year of trying. Finally my body felt safe enough to release! I am still surprised.,"I had a wonderful experience with a TRE session. I accidentally stumbled upon a video on YouTube. Although, I have been trying to do these TRE sessions since long (on and off because I saw no results), but I guess my body didn't feel safe enough to release until today. 
I was surprised at the whole thing. The tremors, the complete experience. 

Initially, the tremors were very light, my legs were hardly shaking, but with time, I saw the tremors increasing. I kept on watching it, and kept repeating affirmations to myself to remind how safe I am here in the room, in this body, and that I trust my body etc etc. Lately, i had been reading and trying to slightly work on my root chakra as well. I don't know if that led to this experience, but I feel so grateful that after an year of constant years, and reading and stuff, my body is finally here. My body feels slightly safe. 

I noticed a lot of things, the more affirmations I kept repeating while also watching the sensations and the tremors, the more tremors happened - more naturally. I continued doing it. It was like cracking several codes today. I kept reassuring myself of how my safety, of my trust in the wisdom of my body. Not just in plain words, but somehow it came naturally, and I could feel that way as well. I trusted myself, my body to do its thing and it did. Body does hold a lot of wisdom. I also noticed how my body has been accustomed to clenching itself in between - I don't know if I should say my mind or my body, but I noticed in between that my body was clenched and I kept reassuring and loosening it and then tremors naturally happened post that. I do hold a lot of stress, my body holds tons of it. It was surprising. I am still in awe at the complete experience.

Towards the end of it, the tremors were quite huge. My legs/ lower body was shaking with tremendous force. I kept reminding myself that I can come back to this whenever I want (due to some work, by this time, I had to start with proceeding towards the end of the session so I kept reminding myself). 

This whole session lasted for more than an hour I believe. I couldn't sleep yesterday night at all, and in the noon I tried sleeping for only an hour and it was after waking up that I performed the TRE session. My mind and body was quite tired and I have noticed that when I don't sleep, and I am tired but awake, that's when something like this happens, it's like I am sort of free, my mind doesn't give a *uck to anything. It's done. No people pleasing. No worries. It's blank. Perhaps, that's why also I could ease myself into it. I had no background thoughts of work, or safety etc. 

I ended the session with bringing my legs to my chest, hugging myself, slightly touching my body parts, and kept repeating all the affirmations again. They say integration is the most important step here. I hope I did it right. Any thoughts?

Something that helped me was lying down with nothing in my head. Usually I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, and I also dissociate a lot, so it's like even when I was doing the sessions, I was never there. But today was different. I had no thoughts, my mind was empty. No thoughts about work, or any person. Just blank. It did help a lot! 

Ps. If somebody needs the video that helped me, let me know. I can share it.
Although, I have tried several videos in the past, but this one just worked magic somehow. Perhaps, the timing or what I don't know, but I am grateful I could experience this. 

Wanted to share this with everyone, hope this helps! :) ",1752770536.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd
1m2f8gm,"Never been evaluated for mental health conditions by CMHT despite multiple requests, think I could have ptsd/cptsd.","The only thing I was diagnosed as was panic disorder under CAMHS when I was 17 and I had no idea until later. I still agree with that, it was trauma induced. I also have ASD, ADHD-C (recent diagnosis, waiting on titration) and some learning difficulties.

From 20-24 I was under the adult mental health services (AMHS) and every time they reviewed my care plan I asked multiple times for an evaluation or diagnosis and I was never given an evaluation for anything despite not just having anxiety symptoms. They said I've had trauma, been to therapy for trauma (CBT) and I went to a trauma education course when waiting for therapy. I also tried multiple antidepressants for mental health and also migraine (didn't help on that front either). I wish fluoxetine didnt wear off when my mum died because it was the only one which helped my anxiety and didn't have horrible side effects. 

I do have some psychosis symptoms, especially paranoia and delusions but they attribute that to my anxiety. That's plausible. The paranoia can be really debilitating and I think people are watching me , trying to take me away or stalking me. I don't have anyone I am close to as I dont trust people and because of autism i struggle to make friends anyway. My ex was abusive. So I don't have anyone to talk to. I think I had some of this before age 12 seeing as ive had trauma for as long as i could remember and I remember feeling unsafe at 5 and I thought one of my siblings was chasing me when apparently she wasnt when I was 9 but my mental health problems really started after a traumatic experience when I was 12 and that's when panic disorder started.

I also deal with eating issues, which some professionals including my previous therapist suspected was an eating disorder and body dysmorphia. Never got me for an evaluation. It is linked to my childhood trauma, as my family and especially mother fixated and made fun of and shamed my weight and my mum had me do slimfast,  clay wraps, electric ab belt, etc. To lose weight no matter how much I weighed. 

I am not 100% sure what it could be. I thought possibility ptsd, cptsd (i have had multiple traumatic experiences since childhood including as an adult and had ongoing childhood abuse until i moved out of home at 20), also thought maybe PPD, OCD, etc. Now I've already had a lot of interventions which have not made a significant enough impact to help my mental health and its gotten worse due to lack of support. despite my requests for rereferral and saying my mental health has gotten worse they have refused to take me back and I researched and found the adult mental health team are the only ones who can evaluate on nhs. The CMHT claim there is nothing else they can do for me. I requested to be evaluated then as well as well as more therapy or counselling.  I just think if treatment has not helped so far what is going on. I've recently developed situational syncope due to mental distress according to doctors after they tested every other cause of fainting. I am really struggling to cope. My mum died of lung cancer 3 years ago which really affects me too. 

I don't know whether I am being delusional or paranoid and it is just panic disorder, whether it's due to resources or something else. Is anyone else in the UK in a similar situation? Can I ask my GP to refer me somewhere? Do I have to go private? I have tried to access other services but they are not funded or they don't want to take me because of autism or my mental health being complex (I self harm and deal with suicidal thoughts but haven't acted on them in a while). I would love to have a CPN again at least so I can discuss support or just talk but the adult mental health services said they have changed their services so I can't have one.",1752776768.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd

This man groomed, abused, harassed and blackmailed me for years as a child.

Im 19 now and im still terrified of him, only reason i got away was because he was jailed for a verrry  short time for possession of cp. 


He had commented on my friends post and i guess i had liked it so he found my account.. his account is under a different name and its a new account so i had no idea it was him..

His message was: "" i know that art. My name? Nice to
know you end up on my fucking
suggested. Clean slate and I see
you and your friends. JFC kill me
now. Well time to make another
acc"" 


He then posted 2 photos that confirmed  it was him.. 

At first i didnt know who it was but the second I read the message something within me just knew it was him.

I can recognize his style of texting without even thinking about it.

I had a panic attack when i noticed and ofc this happens right as my life is the most stressful...
I had just finally accepted that maybe he will never come back and ofc now he does come back..

For years ive started hyperventilating over every message request and of course now the one time i dont think its him, it is. 


I know he cant get to me, i am safe. 
But i am still scared of him to my core..

Im glad my friend was awake when i called her tho and she calmed me down a lot so i could private my account, block him and remove all my tagged photos. Idk how my night wouldve gone without her. 


I know he is just 1 pathetic sad man
But he is who gave me 80% of my fears and flaws.
He taught me i was worthless
He made everyone around me tell me that too
He made sure i had no one left to save me. 
I was a child. 

I wish i could throw flaming cat shit at him and watch him burn. 
It would be fitting because my cats were my biggest comfort through all of the abuse :) 

For that little girl he broke

I will try my best to not be scared of him anymore

I dont know what to do tho to truly be safe

1m25cia,Could Virtual Frosted Glass Make Support Meetings Better For You?,"Hey everybody. First, I want to say how much I respect this community and the support you offer one another.

I saw past posts calling people to connect via video call to support each other. I am wondering why such posts are rare. Video support groups feel too exposing?

But what if you could join anonymously—like standing behind frosted glass:

* With **mutual** visibility like through physial frosted glass:
   * Your camera ON = See others. Their camera ON = See you. Like real glass: No one-way viewing.
* Anonymous by default:
   * Frosted (blurred) by default
   * No registration with name or email
* Click to unfrost a user → he agrees to show himself → you see each other with no frost

It's less pressure than regular video, more human than voice-only.

The point is that videos where everyone is frozen (blurred) by default. Only show yourself if you both agree. Would this be attractive for you to meet via video for mutual support more often?

I've made [a free app](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NJLDHJWLFV7) for this, but I am here to get your feedback if this *kind* of privacy could help you to get together for support more often.",1752752657.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd
1m2a6h0,Do these sound like intrusive thoughts from PTSD?,"I'm wondering if what I'm experiencing sounds like intrusive thoughts? So when I'm really anxious, sometimes I'll have really crazy thoughts come into my head and I hate them with a passion. I'll give you examples because this is hard to explain.

So like I'm Christian but not super religious. They literally say that blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is a mortal sin and you can't be forgiven for it, however the Bible does a lousy job of explaining exactly what this is. So like I'll be attending church and I'll have the strongest impulse to literally yell out something like, ""F*CK (you know who). Then I'll have a 30 minute panic attack about literally just going to hell for this.

Another insane example, is I'll see an attractive woman in the gym, and I'll have an insane impulse to yell out something like, ""I WANNA F*CK YOU B*TCH!"", which would probably get me thrown out of the gym.

I would never say these things IRL and I believe that they're deeply tied to anxiety, because when I take an anxiety pill, drink alcohol or work out very heavily, these thoughts and impulses are non-existent in my brain. Are these intrusive thoughts?",1752765204.0,1,8,ptsd,ptsd

1m25s86,Just a Pet Peeve or PTSD?,"Lately I've been having issues with people who immediately villainize me for not being able to read their minds. But I don't think it's a pet peeve anymore... Every time that situation pops up, I go into a state of impending doom. I feel accused, unable to stand my ground without having to lower myself first and beg. It's happened so often I've gotten the reaction I have to use down to a tea. But I can't... I can't keep doing it because it instills anger and absolute frustration in me that no matter what, no matter my attempts to address their ridiculous expectations. I can't get angry or I become the monster. I can't not agree with them or else I'm subjected to being ridiculed. 

I want to save my peace, but every time one of my female presenting peers be it a friend, partner past and present, or an acquaintance expect me to read their mind - and when I don't. They blow up in my face, question my loyalty to them, berate me with accusations of my intentions with them. Saying I just want to make them angry and how I'm just like everyone else who makes things so difficult. 

What??? It's not my fault I can't read minds. I'm sorry I didn't do that one specific thing because I didn't know? I'm sorry you bottled up your emotions and wait to explode on me because I'm constantly forcing myself to be passive and forgiving? So that gives you the right to direct your anger at me? Because I don't fight back? Because I don't invalidate your abusive behavior? I can't read minds, but I do try my best to read the situation... It's just harder when I'm left to figure out this mind game. And I think it's more than a pet peeve now... I can't be faced with another situation like this again because it's like I'm losing my mind. My sanity. 

I'm scared to be painted as a bad person. Because I struggled with understanding my anti social / sociopathic personality growing up and I've done everything in my power to redirect myself better. But ever since I've tried to be more empathetic and sympathetic through applying knowledge of what I've learned. I feel like the amount of people who try to use me has risen. And I feel like I'm unable to communicate with them because every time I speak up, I'm shot down and called a villain. I usually try to be understanding and logical about things now that I know better... But it feels like I can't escape the fact that a lot of people run purely on their emotions. And they refuse to take accountability when they're in the wrong, they'd rather deflect and point out my sociopathic disorder to make it a point that I'm not human and I don't understand and I don't know or that I can't know. Blaming me for not understanding regardless of how I try. 

I don't want to be around women because of this... All who's ever asked and asked and asked from me. Were female presenting people. And when I couldn't read their mind and do what they wanted, they would constantly blow up in my face and accuse me of wanting to hurt them through weaponized incompetence. But then they refuse to communicate with me and compromise. Tell me what a safe option is. Tell me what I can do better. Tell me what exactly is wrong. None of that : 

""You wouldn't understand.""
Then help me understand. Use your words. 

""You're so stupid. Why would I want that?"" 
Because you mentioned something about it and I thought you wanted it because you said it would be nice. I like doing nice things. 

""You're a sociopath, you'll never know."" 
What does being a sociopath have anything to do with not knowing at the time that you wanted to eat fried chicken??? I asked you? You said you didn't care??? I paid for the meal? And you waited until we got home to complain... 

""I don't want to talk to you anymore.""
Did you to begin with??? You can't expect me to understand if you don't talk to me. I'm tired of the random silent treatment. I'm tired of being refused communication and an opportunity to work out a solution.

I look at the prompts in front of me as what I should say and I've - over the course of years - accustomed myself to one answer and one answer only because that's the only answer that has given me positive feedback : I have to admit I'm wrong, so I have to apologize and confirm with them that they're right. I should've known, I mean... It was so simple. I'm just incompetent, so incompetent that I chose to not know and do something they didn't like or give something they didn't want. It's my fault. I'm the one to blame for upsetting them because I'm choosing to upset them. 

But I'm so tired... I'm so exhausted. I'm not just annoyed anymore. I don't know... Maybe it's not that serious and I do have a long way to go before I can understand people better. But I don't know to read minds. What the hell am I supposed to do.",1752753998.0,0,5,ptsd,ptsd

He’s always been my other half and if I could count on anyone in the house with him, I came home Saturday night from a event are midnight Everything’s fine. I’m talking to my parents, my brother everything’s OK. I don’t have my sleep on the couch next to the couch is my daughter’s urn her pictures, and the teddy bear she got from the hospital. I start hearing these LOUD noises but I assumed my dad was watching a movie in the garage .
I continue to sit on the couch minding my business at this point the noises are extremely loud and its a little girl  laughing hysterically , some crying noises , animal noises but I panicked to the verge of tears( i’m also cross faded so it made it worse ) ran to my dads office said that my mom and brother were messing with me and if he could help .. I look behind the mirror where I sleep and it’s a black beats pill speaker that’s on full volume I turn it off my brother comes out laughing and so does my mom and all I kept saying her and over “you did this next to my daughters stuff “ over and over my brother put his hands up and said “I put it by where you sleep, not by her stuff “ I pointed saying that whole back area was hers because I don’t have any space or anything . my mom saw how freaked out I was eventually and made it worse my overly apologizing and getting everyone in the house to apologize but at that point I was so freaked out .. I just couldn’t do any of it and it made it worse .
By the time I went to sleep, I bursted into tears . It made me think of my daughter , how my body failed to keep her safe , how I failed . Hearing the animal noises and the little girl tweaking out made me feel like I couldn’t protect another little girl ..

I told my husband what happened once we made it home , he told his mom and they confronted his dad. It ended with his dad convincing his mom that I lied and him gaslighting me into believing I misunderstood what happened. This caused a major fight between my husband and I to which I wanted to leave him and return to my family his parents convinced me to spend the night at their home instead to cool off, his mother promised I could hang out with her the next day.

My husband said that I was walking weird and remembers his dad acting extremely abnormal.

At one point I was convinced he and his wife were drugging me because I would always get sick after eating her food and he would also get mad if I turned down any alcohol he offered me. He constantly accused me of cheating on my husband, dna tested my son behind my back, held me at gunpoint in my home because he was convinced I had someone else in the house while my husband was at work. And constantly threatened me throughout the years. We just moved across the country (4 years ago) to start over and get away from him and his wife in hopes it would help our marriage and help me feel safe. I finally told my husband the full details about a year ago and when he confronted his dad he again swore he never touched me. The thing is I’ve been having nightmares again about him and am falling back into that depression I went into years ago where I would barely eat. I’m trying not to be gaslit again but is it possible that I’m wrong? I dissociated so much I don’t remember much except the moments I’ve shared and the way he’s spoken to me and have acted around me tells me I’m correct. Idk how to get the nightmares to stop . My therapist says I have extreme ptsd and DID from the trauma he’s caused but I literally feel like I’m loosing it. ",1752717129.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd
1m1t01v,Strange message.,"Has anyone Had strange dm from someone saw one my post on this previous  subreddit creeped me out little they asking me why not recovered from PTSD yet like dude still in therapy..asking if disclose my ptsd people kinda wired me out anyone had similar messages? Asking would date someone with ptsd also .. just kinda odd , Currently in therapy for PTSD hitting  memories hard all keep doing reliving memories getting some key core self belief but that about it not even close healing journey not even sure can really heal from ptsd? but felt little bit rude someone say have not recovered yet when previously never mention I had. 

Like super paranoid person anyway already because some my issue linked with stalking so could over reacted but don’t know found it so bizarre. Had other DMs people subreddit be lovely but this first time someone asking about disclosure found odd thing correlated with ptsd.  Just rant creeped me out little.

1m1wcyd,Don't know what to do about my feelings other than numbing,"So this might sound dumb but I was on heroin like a decade ago after getting cut off prescription opioids I was on for two years after I got out of the military. I experienced abuse there, and when I got out I was kind of a mess that could hold things together. Still work, do school and somewhat manage a family life. My wife was always pissed that I would abuse the pills and eventually got fed up and I bailed on the marriage temporarily to get help because I saw no way out in the area I lived in. There was absolutely no help and I feared letting my job know because I worked on a federal contract job at the time so I wasn't trying to burn bridges with my employer. I put in my two weeks and my hope was to basically leave in the middle of the night with little things because she was determined that I stay at my job and get better. There was no way for that to happen so I left and checked myself into rehab knowing my.parents would help us financially anyways. I got out and tried to patch things up to no avail she literally brought a new man in the house. Which at that point I didnt know what to do other that tell her I dodnt approve of it. We ended up divorcing which I k8nda fell apart. I turned to drugs to bandage the pain. Drove alot of people away. On top of all of this I required another surgery which set me off to those drugs again. I was maintained well on suboxone then and had to go off of it for the surgery. I ended up tak8ng more than prescribed. My family found me passed out and tried to do a crazy intervention on me where the fucking police were called just for me wanting to leave and let everyone cool their heads. Well I ended up getting charged with Dsorderly Conduct because the person leading the intervention was my Uncle a decon of the local regional Catholic church had his department minions come pick me up and take me to jail litaerally the day or two after having a major surgery.on my foot. Well I was in a holding cell and pissed off because I was in a massive amount of pain to where I couldn't really even eat I hurt so bad. I was non compliant at the jail because I was in a fuck ton  of pain that I ripped up some dumb Christian book they gave me. So I was put in solitary confinement for 2.5 days where the lights stayed on 24/7. After I was released I was forced to clean my cell and walk on my injured foot that was in a cast. To this day I am still pissed off at anything that is attached to this experience sometimes I don't know how to deal with everything.",1752720785.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd
1m15int,Kik stole my childhood,"When I was 17, someone threatened me online and it changed my life forever.

Being the naïve kid that I was—just trying to escape the boxed-in life I had been living—I would always end up finding loopholes to live life, communicate, and just be a kid.

I was in high school and being homeschooled at the time. The first time I ever went to a restaurant was on my 18th birthday, with my one friend that I had made when I went to an all-girls school and that too for a brief dinner while my brother waited outside. I had no freedom, no social life, and certainly not a safe or normal home life.

I didn’t have a phone, but I did have a laptop for schoolwork. I found an app that allowed me to run phone apps on my laptop, and like many of us at the cusp of Gen Z and millennials, I ended up on Kik—the app that stole much of my childhood. I started talking to a specific individual who was obviously a fake, but due to my lack of real-world experience I clearly was too trusting to realize. I told this person that I was being pushed to marry my cousin back home.

This person ended up posting on the local mosque’s Facebook page in my area, saying he was searching for my family. My brothers eventually found it, spoke to him, and all hell broke loose. I don’t know exactly what this person said to my brothers—despite begging him not to say anything—but there was a huge blow-up, and I can still recall the haunting sound of the phone ringing and the sound of my brother yelling through the phone to my sister in law on the other end. 

That moment changed the entire trajectory of my life. I was immediately pulled out of my last year of high school, shunned, and not spoken to. Soon after, this became the ultimate justification for my family to take me to my home county and marry me off—as I was now seen as “getting out of hand.”

There was no room to protest. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. As if it wasn’t enough that this person had already destroyed my life, they weren’t done. They created a Facebook profile with my full legal name, used pictures of me, wrote disgusting captions underneath, and began adding my family members in my home country. And they still weren’t satisfied—they made a picture of me in my bra (neck-down) the profile picture of the account which was the most humiliating thing I’ve ever experienced. 

Because of this, I ended up messaging my youngest brother—the one I was closest to—disclosing the situation and asking him to report it or do something. I had already lived a very traumatizing childhood and wasn’t close with any of my older brothers except for him. He was the only one who made me feel like his little sister. The only one who remembered to get me a birthday gift or would take me to the zoo and provide some bit of color to my horrible childhood.

But after this I was no longer his little sister. He didn’t look at me the same.

I lost trust, respect, dignity—and most importantly, I lost the experience of being loved and treated like a person. So there I was, an 18 year old drop-out from high-school, stuck in a 3rd world country and married to my molester with no way out.

All because of one mistake—a grave mistake that gave me a…

	•	Fear of phones ringing
	•	Holding my breath until I analyze the tone of the conversation on the other end 
	•	Fear of someone messaging my family again
	•	Losing my honour in both family and social circles
	•	Fear of searching my name online and seeing what might come up
	•	Fear of this person returning
	•	I have severe PTSD from this event—flashbacks still haunt me and I’m disgusted by my existence. 


Even today I can’t grasp what really happened to be but whatever it was, my mind, heart and body are still paying the price for it. Trauma consumes your soul - a hard reality to admit.

1m1i5n5,I saw the person that sexually assaulted me,"I was sexually assaulted 2.5 years ago. It still feels weird to use that word to describe what happened to me. I recently got diagnosed with ptsd because of him and his actions. This happened for months on end because we were ""friends"" before this started and I didnt realize what was happening. Eventually, I realized something wasn't right and cut him off entirely. He stalked me for around a year and a half. As far as I know, he stopped.

Yesterday, I was out with a friend, just drinking at a local restaurant when I saw him walk in. Our eyes literally met. I could tell he recognized me and he looked as shocked as I was. (I dont think he realizes what he did to me was sexual assault because it wasnt physically violent). For the longest time, I thought he'd come up to me. Say something. He's the one that stalked me and asked me to talk to him for years. But no. He just turned back to his friends to sit somewhere else - away from me. I was full on panicking at this point. My whole body was shaking and I couldn't breathe. He was by the doorway so I couldn't even leave until he sat down with his friends.

Here's the thing. I dont feel depressed anymore. I dont feel suicidal and I dont hate myself because of what happened. All I really feel is raw anger towards him. But at that moment, for some reason, I was shaking and scared. I felt stupid. I work out and I thought I was getting better. Why was I scared? I also was thinking maybe I should've confronted him. Maybe yelling at him, telling him off, would've been healing for me. But no. I was shaking and having a hard time breathing for some reason. And then I got home and cried for a while.

I called my boyfriend after I got home and that made me feel a lot better but I kept feeling kind of stupid for being scared. Like he's not physically violent. I could've told him off. I feel like whenever I am alone I feel sort of scared. When Im with someone, I usually feel stronger and I'll be more confident. Obviously, I can't ask someone to always be with me when I go outside. I've been thinking of maybe getting a dog so that when I go outside, I can take them on a walk with me. But as it is right now, I just feel angry at myself for being so weak and at him for being a piece of shit.

I dont know how to deal with this complex emotion. Like I just want to stop shaking and hyperventilating whenever I see him - or anyone that looks like him. I dont want to be mad at myself because I still can't stand up to him. I dont know how to be okay ig.",1752685388.0,10,4,ptsd,ptsd
1m1prj5,Struggling with childhood trauma and depression—looking for support and advice,"Hi everyone,
I’m reaching out because I’ve been dealing with trauma from my childhood that has affected my mental health for years. When I was around 7, I experienced some very difficult family situations involving violence, and since then I’ve had nightmares, flashbacks, and severe depression that started around age 12.

I haven’t talked much about it before because I was afraid no one would understand or believe me. Recently, I’ve been wondering if I might have PTSD because these experiences still impact my daily life and well-being.

I’m hoping to connect with others who have been through similar things or who can offer advice on how to cope and where to find help. Thank you for reading — any support means a lot.

1m1n8ia,How can I stop needing stress to feel normal because of my trauma?,"The title pretty much says it all. I don’t feel it’s others responsibility to hold my trauma, but my whole life was traumatic. Until I was about 20. I’m 30 now (31 soon)  and did a lot of great healing. Like the leaps and bounds I’ve made shocks me. I feel like my trauma almost has no hold on me anymore…almost. My husband is great. My kid is great. My life is great. But that doesn’t feel safe. So I need stressors to kinda make me feel normal. Before I got help, I used to just pick fights with my husband (anxiety and abandonment would creep in and cause that) but now I do it in multiple ways. Think true crime in multiple forms, the news, etc. literally anything that could trigger that response. I always thought having safety, feeling comfortable in my relationship, and finally getting rid of the shame would feel so good. But it doesn’t because it wasn’t my normal until 10 yrs ago. I don’t know if anyone understands this feeling, but it’s gotten to a point I’ve developed a pretty bad phone addiction. I just wonder if anyone else has gotten here and figured out how to get through it. Every time I’d think I’d done so, I realize I didn’t.  Sorry this got so long, I just couldn’t find anything on this. Thanks if you made it this far. ",1752696832.0,6,8,ptsd,ptsd
1m1n0su,"My S assaulter was arrested but not for what he did to me, should I feel upset?","Hi, 

I’m not sure if this is the right place for this but I’ve never needed to vent like this before. I (21) was assaulted almost four years ago, I was seventeen at the time and it was my then boyfriend. I took legal action and went to court April/May time last year and I lost the case. The court day was awful and the woman who was questioning me was insulting and brutal as I’m sure most are in things like this, and despite my assaulter waiting outside court to intimidate me he won. After that I felt closure despite the negative outcome, and was able to move on in a way. Sometimes I stalk his mum on Facebook, and often use how I feel about the situation to laugh at the sort of person she is (awful, I know. I’m not proud) An important note is that I will often read the news articles posted about the ordeal and read the comments berating me or telling me I need to go to jail without knowing who I am because sometimes I find myself thinking back and blaming myself for it all. I have OCD and struggle with false memories, so my biggest fear is that I made it up or something like that. It’s all very self destructive. To the point though, I googled his name to find the articles again and saw he had been arrested for some driving related offences. Nothing like what he did to me at all, obviously. But I feel like the wound has just split open. Like nobody listened to me but this is where he gets caught? I thought I was barely affected by this, but it’s really knocked me down and I’ve thought maybe I’m not as healed as I thought. I guess what I want to know is, am I being fair? Can I be upset about this when it’s so wildly different? I just don’t understand how he can hurt a person, and get away with it and praised and get his whole life and job back.

But I’m in the USA so it’s not in the dsm-5 I think. But do they have to only diagnose stuff from there with no other options? Because PTSD, again, is more of a one-time event that fucks u up kind of thing, and I relate to the symptoms of C-PTSD more, with issues regarding trusting others, negative self image and emotional regulation. These things are super relatable to me

It's been over 3 years... I should be over it. But I am not. 
2023 my late husband went missing while we were in Mexico. He abandoned me in a foreign country, took my money and I had no food and barely enough water for one day. I just woke up and he was gone. Months later I would find out he abandoned me for drugs.

The police didn't want to help before he was missing 72 hours. But I have heard before that the first 24 hours are the most critical, how drastically the odds of finding a missing person alive decrease after that. I was scared as the region wasn't safe either. But even my online friends said I can't do nothing. So I went looking for him by myself, just went around with a photo of him and ran ""Have you seen my husband? He is missing"" through Google translate as I don't speak Spanish. Equipped with nothing else I went on my way.

I searched for hours. I had to stop a few times because I was so close to breaking down. But I went on, desperately feeling the clock tick against me, awfully aware of the Odds of success decreasing with every minute.

Finally, a guy who didn't speak English reacted. Through quick conversation with Google translate he claimed to have seen him. Dude looked shady and I should have trusted my guts. But I didn't. I was too desperate. I couldn't pass on the only lead I've had. I knew in my heart that if he wasn't lying and I didn't believe him and it would cost my husband's life I couldn't forgive myself. So I followed him anway, just quickly sending my life-location to a friend with the words ""in case I go missing next."" He led me to a secluded area. There were multiple people there. We communicated using Google translate. They claimed my husband was in rehab and left them behind as a contact, that he had given them my number. Given he was a recovering addict I didn't question it. But then everything stopped making sense. Suddenly they wanted my phone number. Kept trying to pressure me into giving it to them, claimed they needed it to contact him. I don't know how long we were going in circles. But during all of that, I kept messaging an online friend, explained the situation to her. She asked if I was crazy. Told me to get out of there, that these people were traffickers. I was just utterly confused. After a few more moments it sank in that they probably weren't making sense because they were lying. Just in case they didn't I translated with my phone that I had to go and that they should call me. I then tried to leave. They didn't want to let me go. Tried to stop me. I ran. A guy ran after me. 

I remember running in my flip flops. How I almost lost them. How I couldn't even stop to take them off. I am not a runner. I'm chubby and I get winded quickly. I could feel my throat burn trying to keep up with the oxygen demand of my lungs. My heart was beating like crazy. Yet he kept getting closer. All I could think was that the adrenaline in my system wasn't enough, didn't make me faster. I saw a crossway coming up. With all I had left I bolted forward, hoping I could make it across the corner before he could see which direction I had chosen to ran into. For one second I thought I did it. Then he was behind me again. And my strength was fading rapidly. I tried to ask for help at a store, fidgeting with my phone to type the words into the translator as I ran. A guy working at the store was arranging clothes outside. I asked for help. Be just shook his head. My, attempt to get help caused my chaser to catch up. Everything else is blurry. I think he tried to grab me and I struggled to break free and ran. But I am not sure anymore. It's like my mind is playing tricks on me.

Finally, soon after a group of young people around my age noticed me. We communicated via Google translate. They asked if I was okay. I said no, explained I was being followed. They offered their help and escorted me back to the hotel. With the protection of a group he finally stopped his persuit. 

A few days later my late husband was found. His story didn't make any sense. For weeks after we struggled tremendously financially and I didn't know why. We had to fear about affording a place to stay and had barely any food. I cried often because I was so hungry. He wasn't bothered at all, called me a spoiled brat who just never experienced life before. Made me feel bad about the little food I ate, because he was eating even less. I don't know how he did it, he only ate like three bites every few days. We got into a lot of fights. Also, I have hypothyroidism and was off my meds because of the money. I deteriorated quickly. I couldn't sleep, my whole body kept cramping and if I tried to sleep I had night terrors about them chasing me and I suffered from extreme nightmares. 

About five months after he went missing I finally had my answers. I caught him in the bathroom with a syringe. He took off again that day or the following, I can't remember. Called me the next day. Said he went across the boarder (he was a US citizen, I was not) to get food for our pets. Told me he'll be back, soon.

He never returned. He got hit by a car and suffered a traumatic brain injury. I cracked. I kept hallucinating hearing his foot steps. The jiggle of his keys. Screamed his name out in the middle of the night. Saw myself get hit by a car, like the accident happened to me, not him. The hospital tried to get me an emergency visa as they told me he wouldn't make it. I was denied. At the border they told me to go home. 

Eventually, my family paid for an international flight for me to get me back home. I had to go into debt with my uncle to pay for a pet transport to get my pets home, too. This took some time to organize, time I spent alone stranded in a place that wasn't safe. And most of my stuff was gone, too. It was in the car when he took off because he insisted keeping our things in the hotel wasn't safe. 

2023 was absolutely brutal. First, I lost my grandpa. Then my late husband died after 11 months in the hospital. Because of visa and costs I never saw him again after the night he took of the second time. Then, my grandma died, too. She basically raised me and we were extremely close. 

I've had 3 stays in a psychiatric hospital in 2023. Was mistreated. A therapist said what I went through wasn't traumatic, because I got away before they could hurt me. My psychiatrist eventually diagnosed me with PTSD soon after my return. But I was the last to know. I found out when I stayed at another hospital and mentioned how no one took me seriously, that I hadn't even been diagnosed. The psychologist at that hospital finally informed me that I had been, that it was in the paper work my psychiatrist sent. I had been diagnosed months ago and didn't know. What makes it even worse. That therapist telling me it wasn't traumatic was after the diagnosis I didn't know of. 

Time went on. I can't find a therapist. Where I live we have a shortage of therapists. They say it can take up to  five months to find one, but I've been searching for years. I have started studying. I am still suffering from flashbacks, especially during summer. I'm also autistic and the PTSD made my autism symptoms a lot more noticeable and I have shutdowns frequently. My uni started to discriminate against me. A professor wants to bully me out. They hinder me actively. And the professor working most openly against me is in charge of students with disabilities. 

I just can't. I don't know how to continue. How to recover. I can't believe I narrowly escaped human trafficking to not only be treated like goods but DAMAGED goods anyway. I don't know what to do anymore. I am so tired and I am drowning in my pain. 

Lately I keep reading PTSD physically changes your brain. For, years I've felt like I sustained brain-damage. Said from how my brain feels the car might as well have hit me. People told me I'm crazy. But I am not. By now I wish I was, though. I wish it all would just be in my head. Maybe my uni is right. Maybe I am damaged goods after everything I went through. I don't know. How do I recover from this? Is it even possible? Or will I be forever just damaged and undesirable? ",1752695076.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd

1m1bkio,Cannabis use and anxiety,"Hi, honestly I don’t really know how to begin to explain this. But well, basically I’d like to share my experience trying cannabis and the anxiety it has caused me.

It all started on a Friday about a month ago, when my friend was going to sleep over at my place. I had only recently started smoking tobacco, and I had tried cannabis once before, but it didn’t really affect me. So, around 2 a.m., my friend and I decided to roll a joint, and we did. At first, after a few minutes, everything seemed fine, but after a while, I started to feel my heart racing, and everything felt like a dream. Space and time began to distort through my vision, and it was a completely strange experience. That made me feel even more anxious, and I kept thinking I was going to have a heart attack. So I told my friend to call his dad. We cleaned up the house as best we could and went out into the street in our pajamas. Out there, I managed to calm down a bit, reading that those symptoms were “normal” if the cannabis dose was too high.

Then my friend’s dad arrived, and I got into his car. Inside the car, I started to feel like I didn’t care about anything at all, and that if I was going to die, so be it. I even felt, just for a moment, like I had reached nirvana, so to speak. Anyway, we got to my friend’s house, and I tried to sleep as much as I could. When I woke up, everything seemed okay — until after a while, I started to feel a kind of rebound effect, where, through my vision, it felt like I was dead.

That rebound effect lasted for about two days or so, and after that, about a month passed — and then, a week ago, this happened again. By then, I had already quit smoking tobacco because I felt it was stressing me out too much. I decided to stay up all night to try to reset my sleep schedule. So I had two coffees, and while listening to music, I noticed the symptoms coming back, which made me really nervous, and I had a rapid heartbeat. Since then — it’s been a week — I’ve been feeling constant anxiety and this sensation that I’m not real, or that I’m dead and living in a kind of hell that’s replicating my past reality. Even though I can somewhat manage it, last Friday I had another episode and had to go to the ER, where they ruled out any physical issues. I have an appointment next week with a psychologist and my primary care doctor.

Honestly, I’ve talked to family members and everyone tells me the solution is to start getting my life back on track, to have a real future plan — that this would calm me down a lot.

But what worries me the most is the feeling of derealization. The rest I can more or less handle.

I’m also taking Tulsi to help my body adapt, and I have to say that when I smoked the joint, I was very nervous — because I had promised my sister that I wouldn’t smoke any weed. And, well, there you have it.

Honestly, I’d really like to hear your thoughts and advice. I think I can “control” it, but there’s a part of me that says I’ll be stuck like this forever or something like that, which really discourages me. I have to say that I’ve been dealing with a deep, internalized depression for years, and that’s probably making everything worse right now.",1752669729.0,2,7,ptsd,ptsd

I came home from a long day of work, went upstairs, got changed into comfies and when I bent down to pick something up there's a cracking and crunch, shooting pain up my leg and next thing I know I'm on the floor screaming help to my brother in law who was downstairs. I was on the third floor, he was on the first, in the kitchen cooking something. He didnt hear me bevause of the air fryer. I screamed until my throat was raw and after the shock had set in. I had to drag myself to grab my laptop to open facebook to message him about what had happened. I thought I'd dislocated my knee, turns out its a femoral avulsion fracture.

That was nearly a week ago. I'm dual wielding crutches, wearing a splint (luckily I don't have to have surgery or anything, but still waiting to hear back about physiotherapy). I could be daydreaming about anything and everything and then all of a sudden I hear the crunch in my head, me screaming for help, I feel the pain and panic of realising no one can hear me. It upsets me, makes me cringe and sometimes tear up. I haven't had any dreams about it, though. My partner suggested I need to talk to a professional about this, but I'm not sure.

1m1fg11,F21 twin sister might have caused PTSD,F21 here and I believe I have PTSD. So at the age of 19 I moved out my abusive parents house with my twin sister. We moved in with 2 other friends. Everything was great until my sister went into psychosis. And I was her main muse for it. She would kick my door open on multiple occasions and attack me. She would come to my job attack people  hoping I got fried. She would threaten to end me and my other roommates lives. She would throw weights and a basket ball at me and my roommates doors for hours at night( one time it lasted from 1am-7:30am). She will steal things and sell it( she stole my ps4 and tv and sold it). She would trash our house like she would take food out the fridge and just throw it on the floor. And so much more. I've moved out and cut my sister off but when i hear a loud bang or see the slightest piece of dirt on the floor i freak out. But I feel this never ending feeling of shame for failing her.

1m15q29,Anyone have experience with DBT-PE?  Roughly how long does it take for some improvement?,"I'm about to try to go on short term disability due to what my therapist is convinced is some form of PTSD (traumatic invalidation?  or something along those lines, something from repeated stressful experiences).  To be completely honest, I'm pretty skeptical that I even have PTSD due to me not really having any major events.  Like, I've been through some nasty shit in my life, but none of it feels like it has any of the typical PTSD symptoms.  I don't really do much avoidance, thinking about these experiences doesn't trigger anything in me aside from them not being too fun to think about, none of the ""typical"" PTSD responses to them.

What I do have is extremely high amounts of self-loathing, a complete lack of respect for myself, difficulty connecting with others, feelings of isolation, severe depression, suicidal ideation, and regret that I'm still alive, with a longing for anything to happen to change that.

Anyway, I bring that all up to say that I'm not sure I even have PTSD, but am going to go on short term disability (which I do need, because whatever is wrong with me is debilitating and the stress of work is causing me to spiral at a terrifying rate) to focus on working through DBT-PE, and I'm not sure what to expect in terms of how long before things are expected to improve, or signs that it's not doing anything so I don't waste all my disability on it.  Anyone have experiences with DBT-PE and can give me a rough idea of how long it'll take for things to start getting better?  Not completely better, just how long before things begin to start looking up and it starts slowly improving, even if just a little.

Also curious if anyone has any tidbits on what to look for to see if this isn't going to do anything for me.  I feel pretty numb to the traumatic experiences we've chosen to focus on, don't really care much about talking about them, is that a sign I don't have PTSD and need to look elsewhere?",1752648739.0,2,3,ptsd,ptsd

Basically you put in your med information and then set your med taking times and it sends you a notification to take them! Then you can mark them as taken in the app so you don’t get confused if you’ve already taken them or not (happens to me all the time). You can also set appointment reminders, take notes about symptoms and stuff, and see your report of the meds you’ve taken and see a percentage of how often you’ve taken them!

1m0zorq,lost both my stepdad and dad between 5 months in 2022.,"my stepdad collapsed on the ground while i was upstairs on feburary 3rd 2022. there was a blizzard outside. i did not hear him collapse. he died there, was revived by emts, but braindead. plug was pulled 11 days later. my mom went borderline insane. i had to stay with my dad. i was aggressive and cried at the smallest things during those 11 days. i barely remember them. on april 8th, 2022, my dad told me he had stage 3 (or 4) lung cancer. he was admitted to a hospital two months later. he gave me $150 on my birthday in may. on july 26, 2022, he died. the chemo made him worse. the marijuana made him worse. there was barely any life in his eyes when i visited him the one time, about a month before he died. i lied about my age so i could see him one last time, so i could be in that hospital room. he squeezed my hand weakly and said something. i cant remember if he said he loves me, or if he made me promise him to never smoke or do drugs. it might have been both. these events have haunted me for three years. they have never left my mind. when i try to remember things, i cannot remember faces, and voices sound like gibberish. sometimes, i look in the mirror and can't recognize myself. i am wracked with guilt over the death of my stepfather. i was told by an emt last year, who visited my school and who was there that day, that i would not have been able to save him, even if i was downstairs. i am still wracked with guilt. i am wracked with guilt over my dads death, too. i tried to get him to stop smoking for years, ever since i was a little kid. he did hard drugs before he married my mom, and he snorted pills while they were together. he intentionally hid that from me. i never knew until he died. i feel like that if i knew, he would have stopped, he may have never gotten lung cancer, he may have never smoked marijuana again, he may still be here. i am angry at him still, for fucking his own life up. for fucking my life up, for dying like he did. he left me. he abandoned me, and he was happy to leave. he said it was his time. i didn't want him to die. it's selfish of me, but i didn't want to lose my daddy.




ive been slowly recovering. i can remember my stepdad and dad without crying, i can talk about it without spiraling, im not as violent when reminded of it. but, the one thing i wont ever recover is the person i was before my trauma. the sweet, kind, non-traumatized boy (trans), who loved everyone and everything. sure, im still sweet, im still kind, but im traumatized. my thoughts are fucked up behind recognition. i have dark thoughts. i do not act on them. i will not share these thoughts here, as they are against this subreddits rules. lately, i have been having more of these thoughts again. i wonder what my life would be like if they were still alive. maybe a world like that doesn't exist. maybe somebody else dies instead of them. im just tired. i dont want to think on the past anymore. the future is hard to think about though. i dont see myself doing anything at all in the future. but, the present is good i guess.




edit:


to add onto this, my stepfather and father both supported me in the best ways they could. my father had it hard though, he was confused as he came from a diehard christian family. he was one of my first supporters in my transition, even trying to call me his son during his cancer. his cancer spread to his spine, and i believe up to his brain, as i found his facebook a year ago. he referred to me with my new name, but as his daughter, as his little girl. he said that id always be his little girl, but he'd also refer to me in person as his son. im still confused on why he did this. maybe because the cancer spread to his brain, confusing him, maybe it was because he was dying, I don't know. however, it doesn't hurt me that he referred to me as those things, because i was those things. i was his little girl for 13 years, he knew me as a girl, and he only knew me for one year as a boy. it still makes me cry to know that he tried so hard to understand and support me even up to his death. i love you, dad.

So, I never had a good home. My dad has always been toxic in some way, usually emotionally, and my mom has been sort of emotionally absent & kind of an enabler? I'm not too good with terms, but they fit together because they both suck. I mean, my mom is cheating on him, too! 

Along with that, I had lost my online best friend to suicide. I don't remember the exact day or month, all I know is that I met her one summer and a few months later, she had overdosed. I cried my eyes out, being totally alone. We met on Among Us (I find that fact funny as well, but I actually met my boyfriend there as well! Same with other people, one that left a while ago due to deleting Discord,) and so I searched for her, believing that she was still alive after all. I mean, that was the only place we knew each other. If Among Us wasn't outdated on my phone and could still be downloaded on there, I'd still be looking, trust me.

This is the part that I really want to talk about: meeting my ex. He went by a couple of names, but I met him as Tommy. We met during the DSMP era, where people roleplayed in Among Us. I mean, 2022 was great! We met a few others as well, making a Discord group together. Yet, on that(?) day, April 30, he had confessed his love to me. We went through a lot of drama together, mostly due to the Among Us friend group, but we loved each other.

Yet, as time progressed, he began to make a roleplay himself. One that I never wanted to partake in, one that I did not ask for, and one that I never knew wasn't real. He drew me in, speaking of how he was actually Neytiri, that one Na'vi fella from Avatar (first movie). I, for some reason, believed in him whole-heartedly. He made alternative accounts just to continue this, acting as if I was going to be a prince of the Na'vi. At the time, I was called Alex. I no longer go by that name, as he ruined that. Yet, he never ruined me.

This roleplay of his started to get darker. He acted as if, in real life, his alt accounts were raping each other, killing each other, and it even got to the point where I almost killed myself and hurt myself several times. He sent me edited photos of the Home tree(?), in fact, further making me believe that he was really Neytiri. Ironically, at the time, that was the name that he went by. He caused me other delusions as well, one of them being — and don't laugh, I was 12 — that I was actually Philza Minecraft from the DSMP??? 😭

We celebrated his birthday in December. Before or after this, he sent me pictures™️ of himself and I sent one back. I noted that for a reason, I mention only what is needed. Then, a month later in January, he left. I got so mad that I changed my Roblox description, because he blocked me on Discord and unfriended me on Snapchat (where most of the proof of what he did was, I no longer have any proof other than screenshots,) and I was truly at a loss of what to do. Then, he messenged me on Roblox, saying how he was in a ""bad mental state"" and that him and someone else were sorry. Being as stupid and clingy as I was back then, I begged him to stay friends with me. He unfriended me after.

Months went by, I entered another relationship with someone who we'll call SS. I won't comment on this, but just know that I am out of it now and am now with my boyfriend. However, I told SS about what happened and he was reasonably upset. SS and I are no longer in contact as of writing this, but I am grateful for what he did about the situation. The Na'vi ex — Toms — had his discord in his Roblox bio, like an idiot, and so SS friended him. There, Toms pretended to be someone called Kae. 

Kae, SS, and I got into a group chat around 12am. I was tired, it was a school night, and I was freaked out. Yet, I perservered, cause what else was there to do? Kae spoke of Toms being a bad person, with SS and I being unaware that Kae was Toms, and supplied instagram screenshots of 'her' talking to him. Eventually, the fact that I gave Toms a nsfw picture of myself was brought up due to Toms apparently sending a text about him threatening me with my picture. Not knowing what to do, and I think I regret this now but genuinely felt like I was out of other options, I threatened him with his own pictures. He agreed to delete the picture he had of me, I did too, and Kae left by the next day, with me realizing (with the help of my current boyfriend,) that Kae was Toms. 

On top of that, I had discovered (through what ""Kae"" had told me,) that Toms was actually 17 or 18. I forgot what exact age, but that was genuinely disgusting to me. We did voice call, I did see him, but I never thought that he was lying about his age as well. Obviously, he was lying about the Na'vi stuff, yeah, but... wow. Had I really been groomed, as well?

Yet, despite my success at discovering so much more, I struggled to feel free. I felt broken, used, and generally just hopeless. Numb. I wanted to be reused, wanted a purpose like Toms had given me. So, I tried to find ways to hurt myself. Toms had left me at my lowest, yet I found a way to seek deeper. ""Is this what freedom is like?"" I had thought, ""If so, I want to be trapped.""

Still, once more, I had perservered. I reached out for help, contacting an organization and telling them about what Toms had done. I never checked for a reply, I was too scared to, but I did it. Before that, I had told my friends and those I saw as family about what had happened. I was changed, broken, but picked up the shards and screamed ""screw you!"" to the world that had let me be hurt. And it felt empowering, even if the possibility of Toms not working alone was scary, as one of my friends had suggested.

I still do struggle between flashbacks, severe delusions where I swear that he is someone that I know, and generally just depression. I don't expect to ever find my footing. Yet, I've learned how to live in the sky. Alex, or who I once was, may have died in 2023, yes, but a spark of hope was reborn in their place. I think that I go by Star now because of that, for after everything, I still shine and provide warmth for those in need. I've saved people from suicide and self harm, now, and have never been prouder of myself. I can't get therapy yet, but I feel like Alex would be proud. And who else is there to live for, but myself?

Star out. Thanks for reading, it was very difficult to write about this. But, I can't stay silent anymore. And Toms, or whoever you (all) may be, if you are out there— you never won. ",1752617998.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd

1m0v7d8,my tragedy,"You want a love tragedy? Well, this one is 3+ years in the making, and she died a year ago.

I fell in love with a beautiful woman that had a drinking problem. When I met her, I had two full time jobs, a condo , car paid off, lots of crypto, money going to different bank accounts. I had my computer set up for work in my living room and it was just something I had worked for yeeeeears to achieve. NONE of that was handed to me, not one bit. I fought tooth and nail for everything I earned. I digress.

..Really, I could ramble on about why I fell for her even though I was raised by alcoholics, and how at the end of the day I was just her enabler. Regardless of my poor taste in people, what matters is I’m alive… albeit, barely.

I loved her so much that we tried to get her the help she would click with. A lot of programs don’t really do much, so I was hell bent on finding a proper rehab.

So off to texas she goes. To get clean – but she didn’t stay clean and later was kicked out with a one way bus ticket back home. But day after day she couldn’t get on the bus because she was too drunk..

At that time I really told myself that’s it for me. But I was also using drugs, and quit while she was lost on the streets of a strange city. Quitting the drugs sent me into a manic episode where I basically 1) opened a missing person’s report on her. 2) Called every hospital every night, knowing her condition would force her to check in. 3) and finally, I drove like 1k+ miles 4 times to go find her and bring her back. I drove 17.5 hours non stop no sleep each way.

So, through reddit was I able to get some leads on my girl. And one of the guys that was helping me find her, ended up falling for her and was visiting her in the hospital behind my back.

I went to Texas, I went to Ft. Worth, and I found the girl. Found her in 5 hours when the sheriffs told me, “you’re looking for a needle in a haystack.” She was in bad condition when I found her, she was in the hospital for like 3 weeks.

 So the chain of events from the time I found the girl, I found her, got her to a hospital, asswipe comes with me to meet her once – and when I go back home to work this guy’s working “my girl”.

Long story short, She came back, and it was pure fucking hell. She had already been subjected to prostitution and hardcore drug use in texas, so at home in vegas, it was even easier to do.

I’m writing this from my mother’s little apartment, took a mental day cause I relapsed. I might lose my job over it which means my insurance will run out.

I lost everything trying to “fix” her. She backstabbed me every chance she got. I’ll end it there.

1m0vsvt,Very difficult to share- being tormented and harassed,"Hi. This will be a long post and super dramatic ( lol), but I’ll space it to make it more digestible. 

I am a wOman late thirties. I come from sexual trauma and a hellova family dysfunctions. Just for some background. I have had issues with gravitating to men I shouldn’t and being a fast/fresh gal. 

As I got older I’ve gotten better with my self worth and not being a victimized or disrespected. But in 2021 I must’ve still had an axe to grind. 

I was fresh off the heels of Covid isolation and hibernation, I had a fresh dose of I want a baby hormones pulsing through me. I unfortunately ate where I crapped. 

I was super hormonal when I met my neighbor who lives below me. And although I wasn’t expecting much. I chose to just try it out and exchange numbers. 

This is hard to write because I put myself in a bad position ( not the first time , but I have learned now. Finally!!). 

He was saying I love you and all that crap. Although I was not smitten and wasn’t swayed I still continued with the what ifs. He was literally calling me non stop and texting me non stop. 

I told him that he didn’t love me because he doesn’t know me etc (I knew he was just trying to get me to have sex). 

But the time came for me to go talk with him in his apartment. 
Originally it was to have coffee and talk. Insert quotes. 

It was okay at first but then it went to 1000 quickly. He literally whipped out his penis and tried to kiss me. Very aggressively. 

I was taken aback and although I am
An adult and not a child victim anymore I stupidly froze and just tried to be light with it. And he took me to his room and was starting to tear my dress off. 

Again, I was startled but stuck and tried to smooth over the situation not knowing what he would do and just said hey it’s okay but don’t rip my dress let me take it off. 

We had sex. Yes it was forced but I did it and kept it cool and said I had to go home to tend to my pets. He was trying to get me to stay in his apartment. 

I knew obviously it wasn’t for me and I made a lovely long text (to smooth things over), Telling him I believe we are not a good match and I wish the best for him and God bless him. I included how I’m trying to be a better Christian also. Which was true but I got issues. 

That didn’t work he knocked okay my door the next day and said he didn’t care. I tried to get him to leave but it didn’t work and he pushed his way in my apartment. 

This went on for a few months off and on. I would ignore his calls and be okay but he Walpole make an excuse to come to my apartment just to have sex and what not. Oh so we could talk and all of that. Which ended in him pushing his penis either in my back or front. Many times I’ve tried to push him away and he literally turned it into some kinky sex scene. But I didn’t always resist unfortunately. 

I knew the situation was not right and I could have and should have pretended I died off the face of the earth but I didn’t. I began to get angry and cursing him out and being negative to him. I was honestly mad at myself for being in it and mad at him for not letting me go. 

That’s when I began to be able to break away. And get strong. But I unfortunately bruised his ego a few times and tried to fight fire with fire. It backfired tremendously on me. 

Cut to Christmas and New Year’s month 2022. He began to entertain women in his apartment and I unfortunately heard it all. He tried to sleep with me right after that. And I was finally able to break free and although he was forcing himself on me I was able to literally kick him out and push him out my apartment and close the door. 

That’s when the problems began. 
He begin to have sex all day every day (his apartment is below mine), I was unemployed at the time. So I was home, if I went into my bedroom the escapades ensued, the living room bathroom kitchen. 
I turned crazy and banged up my floors blasted metal and annoying songs underneath me loud when they did take a breather from sex etc. 

That was me fighting fire with fire. 

And then I blew the top off his crap with the current lady ship. Apparently he was espoused to someone while dealing with me (he is Eastern European and I am black. But I interracially date he didn’t. I peeped  that which he denied). And come to find out he cheated on her with me. 

So because the building is old walls and floors/ceilings thin I told her the truth. And blew up his spot. 

That didn’t cause her to leave and him to stop. Now from that time up till now. He has included more of his family. They’ve been harassing me stalking and tormenting me. I’ve since moved on and have been single. 
I’ve attempted suicide and was in the psych ward. I’ve tried to move. I’ve tried going to my aunts to lay low. 

Nothing stops them. Now for the crazier part. Somehow he is able to track me without my phone being on me (I know this because when I was trying to kill myself I left without my phone). Btw the reason why I attempted that is because I realized he was following me and tracking me. 

There’s a little more to the torment. He’s used cigarette smoke, drills banging. Honking and car alarms whistling to intimidate me and remind me or let me know he and his family are out there. When I have left the state I have seen him and other vehicles. They switch out the plates and possibly rent vehicles. He has upgraded a van. 

There is even his family with children with them who take them along to follow and harass me. I’ve seen them all over in random places they have no business being at. To intimidate me. But I can’t be in their face and take pictures/videos because it’ll look bad on me. 

He knows how to avoid cops. I had reports made and an order of protection. They are smart and clever. They are resourceful. And relentless. 
Somehow I’m being tracked. They follow me to the supermarket. Walk by me fast or holding things in their hand. Random things. When I’m outside in front of the building they are in the van with the doors open. And the others are circling the building. 

There has been a time when they’ll purposely be right next to me in the store or supermarket and bump into me. Then say sorry or go to their spouse or child and speak in their language. 

I do not have the resources for a private investigator and I’ve tried the bad ways to get him and the others to stop and good ways. I’ve apologized pretended to be sorry and to care about him nothing works. I’ve even not acknowledged them when I see them. They still harass me and intimidate and stalk me. 

This sounds so crazy and unbelievable. I have nothing to prove and I no longer have an axe to grind. I just want my life and anonymity back. 

I have told others although most people don’t believe it’s as bad as it is. And people try to reason and say no one cares that much or has that much time on their hands. Things like that. 

But unfortunately this has been a reality since 2022. 

Here’s another weird/unbelievable thing to add. There is a device from Asia originally you could buy online. It has a pole that you could put up on surfaces above or have it staged below. To make pulsations thumps or shocks at various intensities. He has two and somehow one he could use wirelessly that’s what he also has been tormenting me with. It causes pain in my body  in my feet and legs. And he puts it where my head is and feet and it causes headaches. 

I know it seems crazy and untrue. 
I am a little crazy. But this is not my type of crazy. At least I used to say I wish it was because then I could be in treatment at a hospital and with meds and it would end. 

At this point I no longer seek help from the cops and I don’t always talk about it to people. I have been to work and he had followed me there etc. being outside at someone else place or anything doesn’t stop this. I’ve tried. I have to rebuild my money to reconsider moving. But honestly that wouldn’t really stop. And I have three cats so that’s a lot and landlords aren’t into people with that many starting out. 

The crazy thing for me is I’ve been here with no incident like that since 2011. And now this Eastern European younger guy than me. And his family are tormenting me. 

I’m sharing this because I want to continue to expose it and I’m hoping to see if someone else has been through this. Or if someone k ones if anyone. 

I see them now in their vehicles vans suvs pick up trucks and cars and at the stores and I just look in their faces and point at them. So they know I see them. 
That slowed down some people. But others who don’t care and feel untouchable will just take their place. 

It’s to the point where one vehicle is parked a few blocks behind my block another a few block ahead, and another around the block. They park their cars together and staged so that no matter the direction I go someone is driving by me. I’ve changed up my routes it doesn’t matter. I literally see them in vehicles with their heads out looking for me. And doing uturns to see the direction I’m going in. 


People like these don’t stop. They have to be stopped. But I’m outnumbered and I don’t have access to ruthless resourceful people. Not that I want to. I just can’t to be free and to be left alone. 

I tried to see how it would be if I never left my apartment, went to work, had people over, stay at other people’s places, be inpatient psych, all these things to get it to stop doesn’t work. 

I’m just exposing this and hopefully I’ll get more insight or something. ",1752618463.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd

*Backstory : I myself am a victim of grooming and I am NOT using this as an excuse but more of a, ""I understand that I could have hurt/traumatized someone."" I have been groomed multiple times and this was the only time I was on the other line. I have suppressed this guilt of mine for a while now and it has burdened me for so long. If I could apologize to this girl I would.*

I have done something horrible, when I was freshly 14 (I am almost 16) I met this girl who lied about her age and said she was 9 turning 10 in like a week and I didn't know right away that she lied but I had recently been groomed and I was going through so many traumatic responses that I was so desperate to take back control that I wanted to be a groomer, I never wanted to hurt anyone I just wanted to have control after being hurt so many times myself, so when she expressed interest in me I added to it and flirted with her despite knowing that our age gap was wrong. I started feeling horrible about it and then I got so lucky when she told me she lied about her age and she was actually 13 I felt extremely relieved and we ended up dating and breaking up shortly after but I'm a horrible person, I knew it was wrong but at first I didn't care, and brushed off the fact that it was horrible, just cause I was so desperate to take control of my life again after being groomed.

1m0uy3z,Am i fixable?,"I’m 18, male, living with my mom and her boyfriend, who has two sons. Life’s more stable now than it used to be, but I still feel like I’m carrying around a past that keeps trying to break into my present.

I grew up in a home filled with abuse. My mom’s ex-husband was physically abusive — to me, to her. Cops and CPS were at our house all the time, but nothing ever changed. My sister got sent away to live with his mom just to protect her. I stayed behind and took the hits. I remember nights I didn’t think I’d make it to the next day.

At 15, I finally got out and moved to PA, where I started law enforcement classes through dual-enrollment and tech school programs. I thought I was building a future, and I still am. But even there, things weren’t perfect. My mom’s boyfriend at the time was a Navy SEAL with PTSD. I respected what he went through, but the yelling, the sudden outbursts, the slamming doors — they didn’t just scare me. They triggered *me*. And that’s when I realized I had my own PTSD.

Now I’m still chasing my career in law enforcement — working with the state patrol, sheriffs, and technical programs. On paper, I’m doing great. But emotionally, mentally, it’s a war sometimes. Loud voices, fast movement, tension in a room — my brain goes into fight mode. Not violence, not rage — just this alert, nervous, survival state. I keep it under control. I don’t lash out. But I feel it every time.

Some programs are skeptical about me because I’m honest about my PTSD. Like I’m some kind of liability just for being self-aware. I get it — it’s a tough field — but I’m not broken. I’m *trying*. I show up. I work hard. I care about this path. But still, sometimes I wonder:

**Am I fixable?**

Has anyone else been here? Carrying trauma but still chasing a future in a career that demands strength, stability, and calm?

1m0d9q4,"Stop finding solutions, and just hear me out.","Just now, I (26F) went back into therapy after 3 years of living without it. I've used to had it through middleschool, highschool and college. All of this went unnoticed by my family, because of course the ones responsible for the problem will never admit that there is one.

As a child, I've faced a lot of neglect, and abuse. Forced to stand, and just take a beating, and if I dared to move, the punishment would be severe. Everything was a flaw about me: the way I looked, the way I acted, the things I loved, you name it. And hey, everyone in the family could treat me however they wanted, 'cause no one heard me anyways! Haa haaa.

This treatment haunted me in relationships, friendships, and who knows? Maybe it was because I was actively looking for it, because my brain is only wired to recognize that treatment. 

Just now, after finally breaking down some walls and sharing my symptomes with my therapist, I'm sent to a psychiatrist, because it's obvious that whatever happened to me, hurt me deeply - because my brain keeps being stuck in that loop. Why did I think that I could share that news with my mom? Why wasn't I surprised that she'd point at my dad and blame him.

Why is it that I try to share my inner world with my parents, that they just won't hear me out? Find solution, and find fault within me? That all that is happening is my fault? Is it really my fault? I live constantly with that feeling, with that shame, constant blame towards myself.

I'm so sorry for dumping this, but I just want to be heard, to be acknowledged.

1m0kljw,Partner with sever childhood abuse shuts out the world,"I want to know how I can help her. If I felt this was a lack of love thing I’d let it be. But we’ve been inseparable for 7 years. Best friends, super in love, we just reached all our hopes and dreams and she had just excitedly told her family we’d finally marry this year. She says my family is her true family and sisters are best friends. We set up live to be remote and travel full time. We arrived in our first city, and she started working 14 hour days on no sleep at a new job and got sick. 3 days in, she was distant for being exhausted, and she learned to process any negative emotions by shutting out the world and I had forgotten this as we’d lived apart the past 6 months. I also had just worked 14 hour shifts, no sleep, and felt totally alone and lashed out telling her when she was distant why do you even travel with me if you don’t really love me? And she just said it clicked, and told me to leave. I pleaded, cried, she said it’s done. It’s over. And I drove cross country home and left on a good note saying I always love her. Just give this time to process because it’s not like you, I think it’s the stress and she said okay now leave. But she did admit she still loved me, she just felt nothing towards me besides care and enjoying our connection. 

This is very sudden and not consistent with just having our best summer ever and traveling all over together. She just told me how excited she is for it to just be us. 

Anyways it’s been several weeks. She has a social media business she hasn’t touched since I left. She hasn’t posted, and hasn’t opened any of my messages apologizing for my immaturity and how I’d taken this time apart to really grow into someone who can be there for her and not trigger her.

We’ve never threatened a break up, she has only ever asked for space in the past, but her main wound is criticizing how she loves.

She’s now totally isolated in a new city and won’t talk to anyone. I told her in the message she never opened like a week ago to just take her time to distress and that I’m there for her when and if she needs. Taking some advice from the internet to give her plenty of space and do not show emotion. 

What can I do to help her break out of this deep freeze and not self sabotage our lives? Which I know she loves so much. 

-she told me in the past she can take negative emotions and box them and forget them
-these later appear as physical pain but can be ignored 
-she said once she shuts off emotions to someone they can’t hurt her again 
-she comes from a family of silent treatment 
Parent fiction, guilt
-she said she’s not good enough for me and I don’t deserve someone who hurts me 

Any advice would be great. I really just care about her, and our whole lives are intertwined so she’s gotta talk eventually.

My husband has been in the Army for almost 20 years and has PTSD. He never sought treatment, but it was a lot worse years ago when he was deploying often. Last month, an old Army buddy died by suicide, the most recent of many, and my husband changed drastically. He suddenly asked for a divorce, angers easily, is occasionally cruel which has never happened before in 19 years of marriage, refuses therapy or to even admit there's a problem, and is isolating himself from family. I think he may be drinking more, but I'm not certain. He is currently a geo-bachelor, which sucks because I want to be there for him. Yet, I'm a bit relieved, too, because I am currently his target. For whatever reason, I have become the focus of his anger/cruelty. His parents are so worried that his mom is going to visit him to talk in person because he'll shut her down on the phone and hang up. I don't know how to help, or even if I can.

I guess to intro I've been r*ped, groped, abused, and harassed basically all my life since I was a kid all the way though to my mid twenties. Mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, and sexually. So much so that I can even function as a human being anymore. I hate it when people look at me, everything that comes out of my mouth is stupid, I feel useless, I hate it when people touch me, I hate listening to my voice and thoughts and I hate being perceived in general. I feel so alone bc I don't let anyone in - bc I hate talking about my shitty ass life and the shitty ass things I went through, but friends and family and partners want to know everything and I can't share bc it was quite literally the worst experiences of my life and I'm taking like 90% of my experiences and memories and feelings to the grave. I don't owe anyone details into my life - I hate being asked about it and when I choose not to share I'm viewed as closed off, not being able to open up, not having a heart, not being able to love. And it's not fair. I'm going to die alone (at some point) bc I can't get past this shit and I can't stand for someone to touch me or caress me or anything. I can't do anything intimate  *sober* bc I'm too fucking in my head and relive traumas but not everybody is okay with that, they think it's weird and fucked up. I've never fallen in love, I'm afraid I won't ever. There's a saying in one of my favorite novelas that goes ""yo no nací con el derecho de amar o ser amada"" that sums up how I feel. Basically English translatation with context is that I wasn't born with the right to love or be loved - the context in the novela and in my life is due to the abuse to the fact that world continuously reminds you (through the disgusting acts of others) that I will never truly ever be happy and I don't deserve to. And that's how I feel. Like there's something wrong with me. In theory I feel a base level of gravitation towards people but I've never loved anyone. They've certainly never loved me, but I'm concerned that i actually don't know how to love or breathe or function or do anything bc these mother fucking pieces of ahits decided to prey and abuse a little girl and this stupid little girl thought life would get better as she got older and it only got worse. Idk if I'm even explaining this correctly. I also have a lot of mental health issue due to all of the trauma (shout out jk but also not?) + genetics etc. But I think there is something very fundamentally wrong with me. I crave friends and relationships in theory and yet I feel a disconnect in that want. Like maybe I just want those things bc society tells me I should want those things or idk if it's bc I know I can't ever fully have that/understand that level of companionship or even base connection bc that is something I'm not capable of? Super long and I doubt anyone would read this much but this is how stupid and broken and empty I am. There's something wrong with me and idk how to explain it to make sense. Idk if anyone else has ever felt like this or have any advice 

Clarification edit: I am not a very sexual person in general. I'm considered quite a prude actually (since I don't like being touched, kissed (for the most part), etc.), but in the off chance I do crave that type of intimacy, I cannot perform sober.

1m0g1og,"Space is vital, but it is not neutral. Unexplained silence is not space, it is partnership exile.","The Neglect of Being Unmet.

The neglect of being unmet is a silent death. It doesn't scream,  it doesn't bleed,  it just quietly erases you. You try to talk to people about it but the words dont really capture how violating it feels.  You know you are being attacked, but somehow,  wordlessly.

The explanations feel ephemeral; silky, like gauze between your fingers. Because, how do you explain your pain when there isn’t ‘loud’? When there isn’t visible harm? Because being unmet is about being unseen.

It’s not violence or rage. But it is the deepest betrayal to refuse to witness your partner. To leave them feeling invisible.

And that’s the kind of pain that slips past words. The kind that looks like nothing from the outside. But avoiding conflict absolutely is emotional neglect. Because there is silence, and then there is total annihilation of communication using the punishment of silence. Silence isn’t neutral. 

There are healthy and unhealthy ways to get your needs met. If you just need time to process, you can ask for space. Pausing after sharing vulnerability is acceptable when healthy boundaries are communicated clearly. However, prolonged silence: hours, days, or even longer, without explanation, especially after a partner has opened up emotionally, absolutely can become a form of neglect or emotional abandonment. Space is vital, but it is not neutral. Unexplained silence is not space. It is partnership exile. Silence can become a threat, mutely understood, and follow-up is essential to maintain trust and connection.

Avoidance isn’t harmless. Emotional withdrawal in response to vulnerability is abandonment in real time.

Most of us understand emotional neglect if we see it in children, and we act. We protect, we intervene. But can we see it in ourselves, in our friends, in all the people in our lives? Because what if emotional neglect isn’t just for children?

What if it is also between adults? In romantic relationships? Does it just get ignored as 'domestics'?

Emotional neglect in adults is barely recognised, and I think that is because we have been conditioned to believe some fundamental lies:

Adults can tell when it’s happening.
Many adults have been conditioned to dismiss or doubt their own feelings, internalising messages that they are ‘too much’ or that their needs are invalid.

This conditioning can be exploited by neglectful or manipulative partners, leading individuals to self-blame and question their perceptions. Recognising this systemic influence is crucial. Affirming that feelings are valid and advocating for self-trust is part of healing.

Adults can leave if they’re unhappy.
If there’s no obvious harm, there’s no damage.
Having personal trauma or pain does not justify or negate causing harm to others. Emotional injuries are interconnected, and neglect or dismissivenes, whether intentional or unintentional, are forms of harm that can perpetuate cycles of suffering. Acknowledging one’s own trauma should inspire responsibility and compassion, not serve as an excuse for neglect.

The heartbreak of emotional neglect is when you speak, and all you get back is silence. When you try to tell the person you love that they are hurting you. When you are vulnerable and then you’re met with nothing. You didn’t ask to be saved. All you asked was to be seen. To be met by the person who promised they would meet you.

And then no one comes. They say nothing.
That is the most human truth of all.
Emotional neglect is the harm of being unmet. Not misunderstood. Not attacked. Just... not noticed. And being left alone with it anyway. It’s a quiet scream in the silence. A plea for recognition in the absence.

Because sometimes, the most profound pain is what they refuse to see, refuse to hear, and refuse to acknowledge.
Even though no one talks about this, I know I am not alone.

And if you find yourself on the other side of this silence, remember: The first step toward healing is noticing.

Because it literally can we had a brand new baby boy 37 days old and I was holding him in my arms looking into her eyes on the phone with the police when she pulled the trigger. It woke my son up and he was bawling as I walked to the front door and let the police in. It’s crazy that it’s been 5 years but I think about it non stop like any second my mind is not occupied with another task I can literally see it. I just started seeing a therapist and it’s really helpful but I can’t talk to my wife about it because after I talk to her about it I always feel so much worse. One time she told me it happened because I made the choice to be with a mentally ill person. Who the fuck says something like that to someone they love? Anyway just looking for support going into the weekend. Update made it through the weekend but by the hair on my chin my chin chin. I feel like my wife was as supportive as she was capable of yesterday. She only started one argument with me because I made plans to see my friend who is a vet on Sunday. Other than that no broken bones or anything so I would say it was a successful July 13th. ,1752517187.0,16,11,ptsd,ptsd

Every so often, the Monster I refer to him as, appears in my dreams, along with his partner in assault you could refer to the other guy as. And it triggers me. Last night they appeared in my dream (I guess I should say nightmare) and all day I have been emotionally on edge, distraught, exhausted and feeling like everything was just yesterday. It’s been 10 years and I’m still not okay. I’m married with a kid and still reliving flashbacks I DONT WANT TO RELIVE. I never reported them, I never told anyone, because I was convinced nobody would believe me and I still live with these feelings that nobody would believe me (even though people like my husband know vaguely of it) maybe it’s also because my mother told
me she had a feeling it was happening, yet continued to drop me off at this persons house (I was 14 when it started and it stopped when I was 16) I know this is all so vague. Everytime
I have these dreams, it usually revolves around them showing up, then me feeling immense amounts of fear, anxiety, disgust and wanting to run away, but I’m around other people who love me and at the same time I think they won’t believe me and they will take his side over mine, so I have to suffer being in the same room as them and watching people I love be so kind to them while they taunt me about it. I’m so exhausted and a mix of sad/angry/distraught/tired/anxious/fearful, just typing this. I’ve never went in detail with someone, but would it help to go in detail with my therapist about it?? Does anyone else also battle the idea that nobody could ever believe them??? WHY AM I SO CONVINCED THAT IM IN THE WRONG WHEN I KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT ROBBED ME OF MY OWN INNOCENCE AND MY OWN PEACE.

I'm 15 now and very overwhelmed by motherhood, but it's worth it for my son. I love him more than I ever thought was possible, and he's absolutely perfect, but sometimes I start worrying that I'll abuse him too, especially when I'm nursing him or changing his diaper. I've never had any urge whatsoever, and the thought is so disgusting I hate myself for it, but it's still a huge worry for me. I go to therapy for my PTSD, but I'm so disgusted with myself that I can't tell my therapist. I'm scared my baby will be taken away if I tell him. I love my son so much, and I would never ever do anything to hurt him, but something inside of me says I will, and I don't know what to do.",1752461037.0,138,49,ptsd,ptsd

1lzwqm6,Confronting via text?,"I faced a sexual assault a little over a year ago at the hands of a close friend that I had gone on a date with. The past year has been a rollercoaster. Started college, ptsd diagnosis, started emdr, and began to heal finally earlier this year after months of absolute mental hell. 

I was driving earlier and a song came on that I hadn’t listened to in a while, and i remembered I didn’t listen to that song for so long because it reminded me of the traumatic event. I realized I didn’t even think about the assault while listening to the song until about halfway through, and even then I was like “huh, I missed out on this song for so long.” I am so incredibly proud of myself. 

So, instead of pressing charges, or the latter of letting this guy live in ignorant bliss, I would like to message him somehow explaining what he did to me, and how it affected me. I won’t threaten him, but I will tell him to stay away from me and warn him of what I know about him. I want to take my power back, and I want him to be intimidated by me. 

I know this would help me release so many emotions, but could this somehow get me in trouble? I wouldn’t threaten him or threaten to ruin his reputation or whatever, I just want him to know what he did to me. ",1752523008.0,2,3,ptsd,ptsd

Pardon the length, but this is my story in It’s entirety. I just can’t seem to feel It’s significant enough to compare to war or natural disasters or physical abuse, like what many other PTSD survivors have gone through.

_____________________________

When I was in second grade I was at Walmart with my grandma and aunt. I remember my aunt running up to us and saying we need to get home because grandma’s house was on fire. This was my home too when I was born, as my mom hadn’t moved out yet because she was so young when she had me. I remember us all crying in line while they opened up a register just for us on a rush. I remember the cashier vividly for some reason. He looked so worried and compassionate. He was super fast considering all of the food we had—which my aunt, the only logical thinking one at the time—figured we’d need to buy considering all of grandma’s food she owned was in flames. The cashier was middle aged with medium-long hair down to his neck and just overall had a very 1970’s look to him. He reminded me of grandpa. Same facial hair and mullet. I wish I were old enough at the time to recognize his compassion and speed under pressure and thank him. He has no idea how much he helped us. I’m not sure why I remember such trivial details so vividly during traumatic events. All the way home grandma and I were in the backseat trying to figure out what we had left on. After some time grandma’s breath hitched she looked me in the eye with the widest eyes and said “…the dryer”. When we got there it was weird because I remember not being able to do anything and me my cousin and grandma were just sitting in a pile of defeat, arms wrapped around each other while we sat on the front lawn. So many people drove by and saw us. So many firemen were running around us. And news reporters and vans were trying to talk to us but we were in shock. It didn’t end up being the dryer. It was a fish tank with a faulty wire in the basement. I remember when we walked through later on that the clothes we had left in and around the dryer were melted into the plastic laundry basket. Everything in that basement was black and melted. It’s pretty traumatizing to see a melted TV, ashen furniture, and living fish swimming in a black and burnt fish tank, protected by the water. Especially when you’re like 8. I remember having to pick through everything we owned one by one and having to personally throw out almost every childhood toy I’d had a connection to. I also remember grandpa had gotten in trouble because he had discovered the fire upon opening the door while coming home after work and was hit with a wall of billowing black smoke. It rushed out of the door like a can of tennis balls with so much pressure in it that it was ready to burst. They had a dog and he knew he couldn’t just leave him in there. He stumbled into the house not being able to see anything and grabbed the counter for support. He yelled Buster’s name and he immediately came running out of the house and grandpa got out too. The firefighters knew he had gone in to get Buster because once they cleared the smoke and fire they found a clean clear handprint in the soot on the counter. 

My dad was diagnosed with cancer when I was in third grade and had it for four years. He almost died and there was a month I couldn’t see him because he was in such bad shape. I was still 8 or 9 at this time—the fire happened while my dad was battling cancer. I remember looking forward to seeing him on the weekends and then my dream would be shattered when my mom told me they didn’t want me to see him in that state. He eventually got better and it quite healthy now but I remember starting to have suicidal thoughts in fifth grade when all of this started to get too much. We basically lived at Mayo Clinic for 3-4 years.

A couple of years later my stepdad was killed by a drunk driver. I was in eighth grade. My mom and sister and him were all at my grandma’s camper in a nearby town and I wasn’t too far away at a friend’s house for a sleepover and summer party. My mom had driven my stepdad back to the camper to pick up his motorcycle, because he had been drinking the night before and didn’t want to drive it home. They left and he followed with his motorcycle. I left my friend’s house around the same time with my aunt and uncle, but they’d heard about a backup on the main road back to my hometown due to some accident, so they took another way. I think this was God’s way of protecting me from seeing my stepdad dead in a ditch. When I got home I was going to go to a friend’s house to make cupcakes for homecoming week for our volleyball team. Mom used my phone to call my stepdad, saying he should’ve been home by now and her phone was in his motorcycle so she didn’t have hers. She was concerned because she knew of an accident near a city in between my house and grandma’s camper and wanted to just check on him. Oddly he didn’t pick up and she said be home by X time and I left. I remember when I went back home it was such a nice day on the cusp of fall that I decided to walk my bike back instead of ride it. I remember looking up at this very specific tree and appreciating the sun rays through the leaves and the smell of fall on the breeze. When I neared my house it was weird that so many cars were there. We had the second smallest house in town and rarely had visitors. I walked up the driveway to see a group of random family members standing in a circle on our patio. They all stopped talking and turned to look at me—the same devastated and shocked expression on their faces, tears down cheeks. I remember his dad’s face specifically. I said “what’s going on” gripping my bike handles harder. My mom took one step towards me and stopped. Then grandma took over, noticing her inability to speak, and came up to me slowly, putting her hand on my shoulder. She said. “Do you remember that accident near X that your mom had mentioned?” I nodded and she slowly and gently said “yeah that was [my stepdad].” She paused and stuttered this next part, but it was better to say it bluntly. “He’s d-dead.” I remember throwing my bike to the ground and everyone letting go of their choked sobs and continuing to break down harder. Grandma and grandpa had bought me that bike so I was concerned after the fact that they were upset I had thrown it to the ground. They obviously weren’t, but for some reason smaller details stick in my mind more than usual. I remember stumbling over our gravel driveway to his car and putting my hand on it. It really is like the movies when everything around you kind of blurs and distorts and you can’t really hear anything but muffled noises and voices around you. There’s this like harsh ringing noise that sticks in your mind. I laid my hand on the side of his car and just kept saying “no no no no” though I’m not sure how loud I was saying it due to the distortion around me. Somehow I’ve lost a chunk of time between how I got from the car to the grass but the next thing I knew I was on my hands and knees in our yard next to the patio again. I was gripping the grass blades and the dirt super hard and I remember it was because I wanted to feel something that I knew was real because life didn’t feel real in the moment, it felt foreign. I also don’t know how this happened but someone got me inside and had me drinking water. My memory is very fragmented after that. I remember sitting on my back steps looking at the sky thinking my stepdad was up there. Later on I had this horrifying thought that he was in hell, because he’d been mad at God since his mom had passed away from cancer when I was a baby. Do you know how horrible it is to think that a family member is in hell? I also had several occasions where I’d panicked thinking about his decaying corpse in a coffin underground. I know, messed up, and pretty terrible for a young teenager to imagine. Anyways, I remember my friends who lived nearby coming to my house and just Bear hugging me while I sobbed on those steps. I chose to sit on the sidesteps to avoid all of the family friends and sheriffs who were pulling up to the front yard. I guess my sister had left something at grandma and grandpa’s camper and they were bringing it back to mom before going home. When grandma got back in the car they hesitated to leave because a sheriff pulled up behind them. They watched as the sheriff got out of his vehicle, took his brimmed hat off, and knocked on the door. I can imagine mom’s scream. Grandma said it was the most horrifying noise she’s ever heard. Her and grandpa turned the car off and rushed to her side. The sheriff explained what happened, explained next steps, and gave some advice on mental therapies available. My little sister slept through all of this. I remember going to volleyball practice the next day but stepping in the back hallway to listen to grandma tell me how telling her had gone. The night before, everyone had let her sleep. I slept at a friend’s house around the corner and people slept at mom’s house on suicide watch. In the morning while getting ready my little sister had asked when daddy was coming home, but nobody decided it was the right time to tell her. She was five. On the phone, grandma said she explained that daddy wasn’t going to come home ever again, and, well, she didn’t take it well. I sobbed in the athletic hallway in front of the football soccer and volleyball teams. I remember feeling outside of my body the rest of the week. I remember the sheer amount of food on our table, counters, and in the fridge. Most of all I remember missing my homecoming volleyball game to attend my stepdad’s funeral. I mean someone you lived with for a majority of your life is just gone suddenly, that doesn’t just not affect a person. When a young person dies, the funeral home bursts at the seams with guests. I remember the next day attending his funeral, and walking back to the high school in my black dress. I attended the pep rally depressed in a black dress. Same for the football game, where I could hear two people behind me talking about the sadness of my stepdad’s death and how he had left behind a wife and two kids. The two women had no idea I was sitting in front of them until I turned around slowly and shyly. I’ll never forget the mix of guilt and sadness on their faces when they looked down and  realized who I was and that I had heard everything. The following months consisted of me babysitting my little sister nightly while mom went to the bar and found new terribly negative friends, though I guess I was glad she had found support of some sort.

Less than a year later, in August of 2017, my mom started seeing this young guy she met at a rodeo. He was also from our town. He was only eight years older than me, fourteen years younger than my mom. That’s always grossed me out because my sis and I are also eight years apart. He started out okay, maybe immature, but then he ended up proposing on Christmas Day in my grandma’s living room. I wasn’t there, but I had helped him pick out the ring, though wary of it. He just didn’t have anything to offer mom, he was young, immature, and I always said he was so ugly that I thought when my mom had gone to the bar so much she had acquired permanent beer goggles. Once they were engaged things started to be different. In February, we had a family trip to Fort Myers, Florida in order to get to know him better and acclimate to the new dynamic. Instead of a happy trip, my sister and I were witness to countless fights. One I knew was physical because we were meant to go out to eat, but he kicked my sister and I outside the room at night, in the dark, during peak party time in Florida. He went back inside and we could hear the yelling and movement of other things inside. We sat out there for over an hour before they emerged as if nothing happened and we went to eat. This pattern continued, bruises showing up on mom, and we ended up moving out of our old home and into his dad’s house. His dad was nice. I remember the first time meeting his family we were having Christmas dinner with his sisters and brothers and his dad while him and mom were downstairs fighting. I remember his dad looking at me, seeing I was super embarrassed, and said, “it’ll be okay.” For the last month I attended my first high school, my sister and I slept on the floor of an empty room in his dad’s home. Mom bought a new house a couple months later before I started school at a larger high school in the bigger city we were a suburb of. In October, mom, my sister and I were around the island eating cooking doing homework, etc. I started recording once he came in slammed the door and yelled for mom to come downstairs with him. She went and my sister looked at me scared but I assured her she was fine. We could hear a struggle so I went to investigate and when I turned the corner downstairs I saw my mom’s fiancé, a very thin gangly man, holding my mom up against the wall off her feet, she has always been a larger woman. The sheer amount of adrenaline to pick someone double your weight up off the floor is inconceivable. I stopped the fight and the recording and we all went on with our days. It continued like this for months, escalating. I still have most of the videos. Then my family finally made me go to my advisor at school with the video graphic evidence I had. Once my advisor was aware of the abuse, I had to call the police with her or she’d have done it herself. I was a high school sophomore. A rep from protective services came and visited me and and my sister at our respective schools. Eventually mom got a call that he had to leave. She was devastated and so was my sister, unaware of what abuse and the consequences of it were. I had to pretend to be sad too to avoid getting disowned. She still thinks my stepgrandma turned him in, because she was a teacher and a mandated reporter. Despite all this, he leeched his way back into our lives a couple months later. One time the police had to come and confiscate his guns because he threatened to shoot us and himself, so they had locked themselves in mom’s bathroom. I was up at college by this time. He got his guns back. They’re still together but he takes his meds now and is relatively calm.

Covid hit me hard too. Living through a screen I developed an eating disorder. This is all hard to talk about too so I won’t. I was a 2021 grad so I lost my entire senior year, all track and volleyball scholarships, homecoming, prom, and a normal graduation. We really did have it worse than the class of 2020. I still get sad when I see high schoolers posting their prom dresses. Mine hangs in my closet because I bought it before Covid happened but never got to use it. Anyways…

When I was in my sophomore year of college I was raped by a friend of a friend. I have always wanted to save myself for marriage, so this was devastating to my character. The catch? He convinced me that I was used up now and that I was a whore and that nobody else was going to want me. I was way too innocent and naive for my own good at the time, and thats why it was so easy for him to manipulate me like this. It was his tactic to get me to stay so I could be his little sex doll. I hate talking or thinking about this time and I’ve blocked quite a bit out. I bought the groceries, did the cleaning, and the cooking. He liked that. Once I realized it was unhealthy and that I had been trapped essentially and kept as a housemaid, I broke it off. I moved out of my apartment with my friends into a single apartment and isolated myself. I barely went to class, yet somehow still passed. On Valentine’s Day my rapist came to my work with a huge bag of gifts for me. He had memorized my work schedule. He sat there for an hour while I was busy until I had time to open it in front of him. Later on, he told me that he bought these for all of his girls. I blocked him on everything and quit my job so he couldn’t find me. However, I was left a shell of what I was before him. I was convinced that I was a used up whore so fuck it what was the point in saving myself? I hooked up with more men than I like to admit—8–and idk why I did it. Maybe to feel the least bit wanted. It was awful. I felt awful. I hate that time in my life. It’s traumatic for me look back on. When my parents found out, being super religious, they called me names I don’t even think God would call me. I’ve struggled with the church, though not necessarily my faith, ever since. I got a somewhat long term boyfriend after I decided to delete all dating apps, and started to take care of myself better. The first six months were great, but he was cheating on me for the last almost year of our relationship with one of his blond students, he was a high school history teacher. I had to beg to be loved by him. I had expressed concern for him catching feelings for a student in the past, and for being jealous of blondes, and he assured me I had nothing to worry about. But when he stopped calling while I was up at school and started to be a dick when I was around him, I ended it. I wish I would’ve sooner. In December, a mutual friend sent me messages between him and this girl from back in July when we were still dating, and they also made it Facebook official shortly after my discovery. Embarrassing. It’s like everyone knew but me.

Then I started this great relationship with my recent ex-boyfriend. But I couldn’t let go of my ex before him for like two months. I feel so guilty that I put him through that. Idek why I tried for my ex. I think I was moreso obsessed with the feeling of stability, not with him as a person. My recent ex (and I mean less than a week ago I broke up with him) and I have had a rough go, but he’s genuinely the nicest boyfriend I’ve ever had. He reminds me of my first boyfriend, who moved away during covid. In the end, I was convinced that, despite me breaking up with him, he broke up with me due to my tiredness and my mental issues. He convinced me that despite his yelling and manipulativeness, I was abusive. I still don’t know if I was the manipulative one in the relationship. But I do know he’s right about my mental health. For me to lose such a good thing because of something out of my control is devastating, and I considered suicide again the night we broke up. I just don’t know what to think. If I was the manipulative and emotionally abusive one or him. His family thinks It’s me my family and friends think it’s him.

Still, none of this feels enough for me to actually have PTSD. I just don’t know what to think.",1752507728.0,2,3,ptsd,ptsd
1lzfi0c,Healing doesn’t always feel like progress,"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but healing isn’t always soft or beautiful. It’s not a peaceful yoga montage or some cinematic comeback. Sometimes it’s pacing the same floor you’ve walked a thousand times, feeling like you’ve come so far and somehow gone nowhere.

I’ve been trying to live more in the present — not stuck in the past, not bracing for the next disaster. But when you’ve spent years just trying to survive, existing without crisis feels unnatural. My nervous system still doesn’t know what “safe” is. I’m not always sure I believe in “safe.”

And yeah, I write. I make art. I reflect more than is probably healthy. I’ve unlearned a lot and seen through a lot of the performative crap. But I still get waves. I still get those days where I wonder if I’ve actually healed or if I just got better at narrating my own pain.

I guess I just wanted to say this out loud in case anyone else is feeling stuck while doing the work. If that’s you — you’re not crazy, lazy, or broken. You’re in it. And maybe “in it” is still a kind of progress.

If you’re also in the thick of it — the healing, the unraveling, the rebuilding — feel free to say hi. I don’t need advice. Just some real human connection would be nice.",1752475779.0,14,5,ptsd,ptsd

1lz5iwv,How to tell my psychologist I’m going to someone else,"I shared something that felt traumatic with my psychologist. About when my ex ignored me when I said no and he kept on forcefully trying. I felt very unsafe and dirty after that but my psychologist basically told me“Well, what did you expect if you were in bed together?” — and he implied that I couldn’t really say something had happened. He was the first person I ever told about this, and after his response, I completely internalized it and forgot it had even happened — until I got triggered. I feel like it made the healing process way more difficult. Every time I mentioned something about this ex — who was very controlling — my psychologist would try to find something positive in it. I don’t feel safe with him, and now I need to let him know that I’m changing therapists and that I’m currently on a waiting list.

1lzl9si,PTSD attack?,"I've been told by therapists before I likely have PTSD or CPTSD. I dont really believe this to be true but after yesterday I am questioning things. I mostly need advice on what to tell my therapist on Friday. Would this be a PTSD attack?

So yesterday evening I was sitting on my front porch smoking a bowl. The neighbours across the street were out with their kids (they are about 2 and 5) and they were both running around naked up and down the street. They fight a lot with each other and their kid and its not the first time I've had a reaction to it but those are usually panic attacks. This was something else. 
 They started yelling at their kid (the 5 year old) for some nonsense about a toy. The kid got frustrated or scared and hid in their car. They started yelling at him more and then grabbed him out of the car and thats when he started wailing. The way he was crying out that he didn't want to go inside the house triggered something in me. I had a strange physical reaction.

It was definitely not a panic attack or an autistic meltdown. I have had both of those before. This was different, I started to feel like I was floating above myself almost. My body became really hot but not sweaty. I was not hyperventilating or breathing heavy. I was breathing normally. I was shaking a lot. I had a pit in my stomach and I felt lightheaded. I almost passed out. The thoughts that accompanied were jumbled but I felt like I WAS the kid. Or at least, that i've been in the same scenario as him before. I also kept thinking that the only people who are teaching him to act this way are the parents. It lasted for around 10 mins even after the parents went inside. The kid calmed down on his own after getting back into the car (the parents rolled the windows down at least). 

I was able to calm down by taking deep breaths. All I wanted to do was tell the kid ""it really sucks when they dont listen to how you are feeling"". But i was too frozen to even speak. I ended up being able to say it after I let my cat out on the front porch and I saw him looking at her out the car window. He hid back in the car for a second and then came out to give me the middle finger. I laughed that off. Not long after i went Inside I heard the car alarm go off. In total he was probably in that car for about 45 mins. 

I will also mention I was not high when i had the strange attack. I didnt finish my bowl until after I calmed down, I knew it wouldn't make it better.",1752496679.0,2,2,ptsd,ptsd
1lzh3bc,my abuser apologized to me and i dont know what to do,"my former best friend turned into my stalker and abuser many years ago. he would threaten me every single day. wanted to kill everyone i knew. carried weapons on him at all times. i havent spoken to him in years and he messaged me through a mutual friend (his friend, used to be my friend but not anymore). these are the messages, i dont even know what to do. im a mess. i want to respond and leap at the chance to finally speak my mind. but im just so overwhelmed. i have really complicated feelings about him. fear, anger, sadness, fondness. he used to be my best friend so i feel empathy and deep devastation at the way he turned out. i watched him spiral. i have fantasized about this very apology and now that it's here, i dont know what to do. im completely paralyzed. any and all help is welcome and very needed, im a mess.

here is his message:  

""im gonna write all this out because i need to say it. i'm not sure what's going on, as you said you needed answers, but you decided to shut me out instead. and what was the logic in adding me a while back if you felt this way about me? this isn't meant to be an attack in any way, that's not what this is about at all. this situation weighs on me so much and i just want to clear everything up. Im not asking for forgiveness, further discussion, or anything at all, i just wish to provide much needed closure for both you and for myself. i think of myself back then and i want to crawl out of my skin. i thought was the absolute shit while being an abomination of cringe. it was disgusting. i was hideous inside and out. it's not about being cringe, that's just the cherry on top that makes it all the more horrific. i am not going to act for even a second like anything is an excuse for how i acted. there is none. no part of me believes that. however, i really do think it would be helpful to provide some insight. during that year, i was spiralling deeper and deeper into psychosis. i started believing some incredibly fucked up delusions about murder and suicide, the two of us, that all humans except for us were demons and predators trying to infiltrate my thoughts and control me, i could go on and on. and saying what ithoughtjust makes it that much worse. some backstory about me and what has shaped me in countless ways is my mom. i wouldn't have told you that back then, because she had me completely brainwashed and acting out. i was abused by her in every way from incredibly early childhood. she convinced me that my dad was abusing me, the school was out to get me, that only she could save me, and that i was autistic and disabled, which took me so long to wake up from. i lived in an entirely different world where i idolized both you and my mother like gods. i convinced myself our souls were intertwined, and that everyone was secretly in love with me. yeah i was a crazy bitch. it's disgusting.i have been in one way or another for my whole life and i'm the last person to pretend i don't have issues, but that was like nothing else. i kept getting in trouble in school for the threats i made which i had intended and thought were totally justified at the time, the way i kept harming mysel, and all the stupid shit i said and did because i thought for some godforsaken reason i should. i was to the point i was hearing voices and i was so blind to what was happening. i feel gulty and absolutely mortified. there has been this unrest in my
mind that i can't make things right ever since. i know i can't and that i have to accept that.i don't think i deserve forgiveness and it's totally reasonable to thinkř a psycho when that was all you knew of me and it was to the most extreme it had ever been. that must have been so terrifying to bear witness to. ïm sorry you had the misfortune of meeting mei in that time of my life and being the subject of which all of my inner pain and desperation latched onto in this twisted way. since i was getting in trouble, my mom took the opportunity to pullme out of school like she had been trying for years out of her drive to isolate me and lied to everyone about the situation while proceeding to not educate me because of my ""disability."" everything made so much sense when i realized this was munchausen behavior and i emembered how blatant the abuse was. i knew it efore. i knew it very well, but i went through periods where: she got tso in my head thatm my own susceptibility to delusion and the fact that she had successfully isolated me to having nobody but her throughout my whole life that i thought so many things. she was obsessed with you too. i never realized it was kind of predatory. she egged me on in what i did and in what should do with you. i'm sorry. i'm beyond sorry for everything. there's no explanation for the obsession i had and i truly cannot wrap my head around it. it was beyond irrational and i'm simply unable to provide any reason at all for why. it's understandable to be scared of me. ive been such a creep and for no good reason. had found out during the time that i was away that i was really just severely traumatized the whole time, which was a given and i had been treated for since i was 9, along with discovering i have borderline personality disorder. i feel like that's not much of a shocker given stereotypes, but i assure you that it's a me problem and not a problem of the disorder. it's not an excuse and it does not mean someone is a creep, a stalker, whatever the fuck i was. ive got my issues, but i'm at least not that way anymore. that's the basic rundown. i want to assure you that my intentions are pure, that i am not going to pursue you in any way, shape, or form, and that i am genuinely sorry. i understand being fearful and weirded out, but i have no reason and no desire to cause any trouble. it's all a mess i caused in middle school that i can't tell you why and now i fully accept the responsibility of cleaning it. i hope that can provide anything of aid at all. im sorry. please take care""",1752482093.0,4,6,ptsd,ptsd

It’s been two years and I have always thought this was irrelevant and I was misdiagnosed. Today I went to see someone I taught when she was my student and they mentioned her. As soon as I heard her name I felt so far away from the conversation. I ended up having a panic attack in the bathroom and barely even remember driving home.

She offered a free 15-minute introductory call. The initial message was already quite rigid: “this is not a space for emotional venting,” “you must cancel at least 6 hours in advance,” etc. Still, I respected that and scheduled the call.

At the agreed time, I waited for her call. It never came. I received no missed call, no notification, absolutely nothing. I double-checked my phone multiple times.

When I politely messaged her the next day to let her know, she replied saying that she did call and sent me a screenshot from her side. However, there is no record of any call on my phone at all.
Instead of trying to understand or acknowledge the possibility of a technical issue, she accused me of lying, said I had bad manners, and told me she uses these calls to “filter out” people she doesn’t want to work with.

It completely crushed me. I felt invalidated, attacked, and ashamed—when I had done nothing wrong. I was trying to seek help, and instead I got blamed for something that wasn’t my fault.

Well at my last healthcare appointment, I went over some concerns with a medication and blood pressure stuff. My APRN suggested I do a sleep study to see if theyre missing anything (i dont think so. I think i was overdoing it and stressed out looking back). I felt like I couldnt breathe for a second because I was already worried I was on a downward spiral cause my bp was off. And then I felt like she was suggesting the sleep study to get me to stay in the hospital hooked up to a bunch of things again. 

Like the only ""doctor"" I am willing to see on a regular basis without getting anxiety to call and schedule an appointment is my therapist and thats still taken some time. Because i fear that one thing will go wrong and ill be on life support again.

1lzei9l,What do I do after a diagnosis (that I’m in denial about)?,"My therapist said a year ago that I check all the boxes for ptsd. Problem is, I don’t believe them. Like I know that I have pretty much every symptom I just don’t think what I experienced was traumatic enough to warrant that diagnosis.

I used to be aware of my potential trauma. But then I started to tell myself like a mantra that nothing bad happened and I’m fine and that I’ve been wrong this whole time. This was a deliberate decision as an experiment on myself that absolutely worked and now I’m so stuck in it that I can’t even accept that I ever get upset or that I ever have been. Whenever I get emotional I tell myself it’s my fault and I’d be a bad person to express any of it because I’m lucky enough to have had a perfect life.

I’d describe my life as unconventional but not necessarily traumatic. Mostly because I was sheltered from the worst of everything and besides, it didn’t hurt me as bad as it hurt other people. My father was abusive to my mom so any abandonment trauma I might have from him leaving is overshadowed by her struggles. There was addiction in my immediate family but I didn’t know about it until the custody battle. There was so much death and loss in the family for a few years but my mother was hit harder by it than I was. And it all stopped by the time I reached high school.

But this mindset putting me in a really weird headspace. I’ve since been diagnosed with a personality disorder (which I do think is a completely accurate assessment of myself) and I’m convinced I taught myself to be this way. I couldn’t tell you anything about the way my parents raised me because it doesn’t feel like I was there for any of it. In fact, my childhood might as well have happened to someone else with how detached I am from it.

So I guess I’m asking: is it worth it to unpack this? And am I alone in these feelings? Everyone else around me seems so much more aware of their trauma but I have a diagnosis and I still don’t know what to do with it other than prove it wrong. Is this healthy or am I just hurting myself by doing this?",1752472044.0,2,3,ptsd,ptsd
1lzgjxa,I think she gave me PTSD,"Hi, I’ve actually gone through a life-threatening medical emergency where I nearly died from blood poisoning, doctors said I only had about 24 hours left. But that's not that story because that’s *not* the experience that left me with PTSD.

What really affected me was a relationship with a girl. I know that might sound a bit cliché, but it was anything but ordinary. She pursued me for a long time, I kept my distance at first, but let her in after she tried for months. Once I did, things took a strange turn. She started to flirt, then a couple of months later, suddenly flipped and became someone completely different. For a long while, she treated me with a level of cruelty I’d never experienced before.

That experience changed me. Looking back, I think what made it hit so hard wasn’t just the emotional rollercoaster, it was that she was the only person I had really talked to at the time. After everything, I started experiencing all the symptoms of PTSD.

It’s been five years now. The nightmares and flashbacks are gone, and I no longer have feelings for her but the pain is still there. I’m still working on reconnecting with positive emotions and healing fully.

I also seem to have an allergic reaction to women now, the moment I approach, or am approached, the memories of her cruelty flashes back again, and I start to panic.

Ive realized more and more the trauma I had growing up. How ingrained these negative thoughts are, how far they go back. Later in life I had secondary trauma and then finally a full blown episode in 2023. A lot of things have changed since then. I'm still me, but not fully as I was.

Anyways. I want to advice, resources, etc. I'm still working on forgiveness. For myself and for my parents, mostly my mother. And it's not for her, it's for me. Because recently I have come to the point where I say things, ""I hate her"" ""what a bitch,"" ""stupid bitch,"" etc. I don't like having these thoughts and the feelings with it. Because it's consuming me. And I want to let it go and move on. Not care anymore. Not fear of what I would do or say to her because I know I my won't like myself afterwards.She would be the easiest target of my rage. And I would just be like her. Hurt someone because I'm hurting too. 

For about a year, I be just been spiraling. I lost my confidence and power. I feel like a victim all over again with everything in my life. I have a victimization mentality that is hard to shake off, and it's starting to get to the point, ""life is happening to me"" instead of feeling somewhat in control and empowered. That I can keep going and make life happen for me. 

I'm in a space that I feel miserable, self hatred, self blame, worthless, hopeless, shameful and just over all falling apart and sometimes I just don't want to be alive anymore. 

Im in therapy and fuck it's hard. I'm on meds, but still fucking hard. I want to increase my sessions each week but I can't right now. There's so much shit to sort the through. I feel like it's going to be years of this shit. 

So what resources, advice you have. I was recommended two books in the past, which I'm still going through and helpful, just hard to apply it.

1lz3enz,Reliving childhood sexual abuse from family member and negligence from parents in late 20’s.,"Hello everyone. Looking for some advice moving forward. As of the writing of this post, I have not been officially diagnosed with PTSD however my scale according to my therapist is a 50/80 on the PCL-5 test. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and I received those diagnoses at age 15. I am currently 29 years old.

From the age of 5-13 I was sexually abused in every way from my older sibling, regularly for years. We are both males. During that time my parents were alcoholics, and mentally verbally and sometimes physically abusive, especially into my early 20’s. 

I’ve spent the majority of my 20’s living away from home but recently I had to move back to my hometown due to me quitting my last job, and not really knowing what else to do, and it has been nothing short of a nightmare. I don’t live with my parents I live in my own house about 15/20 mins away. I am having flashbacks, I am waking up screaming and soaked in sweat from nightmares. My mom seems to be the biggest trigger for me as she has many mental health issues herself, severe to the point of inpatient treatment would be helpful, but that will never happen. I need advice on how to be cordial with them and my family without feeling so much resentment. 

I was seeking therapy, however when I moved back to my hometown I lost my therapist and am currently searching for one here. My instincts are telling me to leave again, but also I have friends whom I love with all my heart, and a partner here. 

Anyone in familiar situations, what advice do you have for me? In terms of being able to handle arguments or triggering moments with my family, I am able to not work myself into a complete panic attack over things but it does make me uneasy and sick to my stomach, and my anxiety will be triggered for the rest of the day and I will shutdown and be short with all people, even if it’s just someone trying to help. 

Wishing everyone here lots of peace and healing. Would never wish this pain on anyone.

1lz6f6m,"PTSD, DPDR, and body sensations after a bad high","About four years ago, I had a bad experience with a cart (not my first bad high). Every time I smoked, I'd feel like I was having an allergic reaction - starting in my mouth and spreading throughout my body, often leading to panic attacks. After using a cart the most recent time, I felt everything moving in slow motion and had another panic attack. It was something I was used to, so l thought it would pass, and I went to bed. A few days later, I started feeling DPDR (like everything was fake, like I was losing control) and continued to have panic attacks. I've been stuck in that feeling ever since.
The allergic reaction felt like that ""falling into a high"" sensation — a loop I couldn't break out of, triggering panic and dissociation. At first, people told me to just ignore it and live my life, so that's what I tried to do. I went out, went to school, hung out with friends, and even got a job. I was also working out, eating healthy, and trying to stay active despite the panic attacks. But a couple of months ago, I had another panic attack that felt just like that high again, and since then, l've been unable to drive, go to school, or even go to the grocery store. I even lost my job.
I used to be able to drink alcohol, but now l avoid it because it triggers me. I tried wine recently, something I've drunk many times before, and it brought back the same sensations. It's the same with coffee and other foods. Now I'm scared to eat or drink anything that could trigger me.
The symptoms I'm dealing with feel like:
• Tingling/numbness throughout my body
• Dizziness/lightheadedness
• DP/DR (feeling like everything is fake)
• Hot flashes/shivers
• Anxiety about going out
• Feeling like l'm going to have an allergic reactio (even to food)
• Tightness in my throat (feeling like a lump)
• Shortness of breath
• Weak legs and numbness in my arms
• Irritability
• Constant leg shaking
• Sensitivity to light/noise
• Foggy vision
• agoraphobia or avoidance?
I was diagnosed with PTSD, but l've avoided medication because it triggers that feeling. Despite trying therapy, EMDR, and exposure therapy, the symptoms haven't gone away.

I've had EMDR and follow-up DBT, and they did wonders for my day to day. I feel ""cured"" in that I no longer suffer flashbacks of the trigger event and can revisit the place it happened. I don't have panic issues in the day.

But the nightmares never stop. They're not related to the event anymore, instead I am continuously dreaming of my own death.

And it's always horrific. Drowning in a car that drove off a cliff into the ocean. Being gassed. Caught up in a warzone. Last night I dreamt I was in a car with my sister and a nuclear bomb landed in the distance, we burned to death in the heatwave and I screamed ""I love you"" at her over and over till I ""died"".

The dreams always end in things going black and silent. I stay hovered in that abyss of nothing for a moment, and then I wake up.

It's the only part of my life now that triggers the symptoms. I wake up feeling like I've been traumatised again, and spend days back in the thick of it, but it never _really_ happened.

1lz96wb,Unwanted grabbing during dog training session,"CW: unwanted physical contact, male dominance, dissociation. 


Long post - originally posted in puppy101 seeking advice, but here too for the trauma side of a distressing experience. TLDR at end.

My (25F) puppy (toy breed, 9mo) has an amazing, relaxed and gentle temperament. She is also very playful and energetic. I’ve been training her and she has brilliant house behaviour, but outside is still challenging as she is so excited and wants to sniff, play and say hi to everyone. I wanted to try some training classes to help with some of this stuff and came across a really highly rated place with loads of followers online. The guy on the phone seemed really intense and in a rush though, so I was nervous and thought we’d try just one session to see if the environment was right (rather than pre-pay for a whole course).

My friend agreed to come with me for some support.
I have PTSD and can be quite dissociative — I’ve been working on it for a few years, but certain things are still strong triggers. For now I’m just trying to avoid those triggers. My friend doesn’t know about the PTSD, just that I get quite anxious. But I was determined to try this out for my puppy’s sake as she’s amazing and just needs some guidance (as do I).

This is where it all went downhill. I’ve always heard about positive reinforcement and wanted to strengthen our connection and attunement to each other. But when I got there, it was really intense and dominance-based. The guy seemed young, in his 20s like me, but he looked like a bodybuilder. He made the people in the class (me especially, for some reason, as he kept picking on me) look and feel like idiots, and kept calling me weak and being disparaging. He put a slip lead on her and kept pulling her up or pushing her down into sit, etc. It was very force-based. I was shocked but he kept chastising me when I protested. 

He wasn’t hurting the dogs and petted them a lot. But it was very much a matter of handling technique and enforcing the positions using your hands (i.e. not reward-based). You could pet them if they did it right, but no food (that’s fine, I guess). But I hated the idea of yanking her around, and when I resisted or was gentle, he kept calling her and me ‘weak and insecure’.

I felt terrible. She was confused and kept hiding behind me or trying to climb into my arms. She was ok after, as the trainer pointed out, but she wanted to lie at my feet and wasn’t allowed to as he kept demanding I pull her up and push her bottom down into sit. I didn’t want to and he became even more harsh with me, counting aloud while I tried to cajole her to sit instead of push her. He said I am inclined to immediately comfort her, but that gives her all the control. At this point I was really reassessing because I didn’t agree with any of what he said (my friend also seemed perturbed), but the class was really expensive and I’d only been there 10 mins, and was doubting if I actually knew anything about training as he was commanding the whole thing, yelling at us.

But then the trainer suddenly grabbed me. He was saying I was doing something wrong and grabbed me to physically correct me. I completely froze. My PTSD relates primarily to being overpowered by men. I did not expect him to put his hands on me so suddenly and so roughly. I instantly felt the dissociation coming on and was desperately trying to keep myself at bay.

But then he just kept touching me. It was always so sudden and not even light touch but like proper manhandling. My voice had completely vanished from the shock of it. I just felt so frozen and couldn’t take in anything. I was trying to speak and say, “Don’t touch me, please,” but he was so intense and kept yelling at me that I just started shrinking.

He tried to pull my crossbody bag off me at one point and I jumped back and quickly removed it myself, and he said, “What’s all this sh*t?” and pushed it into my friend’s hand. I wanted to get away from him but was already dissociating and struggling to remember simple things like how to get out of the situation. Then he came from the back and grabbed me again, this time even more physically, pushing me into a position, and when he was done he unnecessarily put his hand on my lower back and smacked twice as if to say, “There, off you go.”

This last one was so overwhelming and horrifying that I just short-circuited. I just started crying intensely and trying to hide. Between him touching me, not being able to tell him to stop, and the way he wanted me to treat my puppy and how unhappy she looked, I felt completely immobilised and couldn’t stop crying and shaking.

He heard me, even though I was trying to hide at the back, and he came over and demanded to know what was wrong. He stopped the whole class so everyone was looking at me and just insisted on knowing why I was crying. I didn’t know what to say — I couldn’t say I’m having a PTSD flashback in front of all those strangers — and I felt even smaller the more harsh and dominant he was getting.

My friend rushed over, looking alarmed and frightened herself, but didn’t know what to do. Then he reached forward to grab me again and I just gasped out, “Please don’t touch me.” I don’t know where the courage came from. He looked incredulous, like I was making the most absurd request. Then he said if he didn’t, my dog would choke. My friend started arguing with him, saying he didn’t need to touch me and could just say or demonstrate himself, but he was insisting he had to physically correct me. I repeated that I didn’t want to be touched, but he continued to argue with both of us and I felt trapped — like I wouldn’t be able to convince him to keep his hands off me. My friend looked to another class attendee for support, but she just seemed irritated and agreed with him. He said we were being ridiculous and acted like we were making a big deal of nothing. All I could think was — maybe I was. It was just like reliving things that had happened before, when older dominant men had insisted nothing was wrong until I believed them.

Eventually, and grudgingly, the trainer agreed not to touch but continued to tell me off. I didn’t even process anything after that. I was just trying to comfort my puppy. We could have just left, but both my friend and I didn’t know if we were just ignorant and making a scene (we haven’t had dogs before).

When the session was over, I was still overwhelmed, upset, feeling guilty and still unsure if I was the problem. There were missed calls on my phone from my parents. Apparently my friend had been panic texting my sister saying the guy was yelling at me and grabbing me. My sister told my parents and they were calling, worried something serious had happened — they thought we had been accosted.

When I told my dad the whole thing afterwards, he was livid. He said touch without permission is against will and can be considered assault. He wants me to demand my money back because I wasn’t paying to be talked to, treated, and touched like that — and to threaten to leave a scathing review otherwise. He said how the guy reacted after was gaslighting — making me think I was making a big deal of nothing. He said guys like this get away with it because their behaviour goes unchallenged.

He is stressing that I have nothing to fear from that man at all now, and doing this gives me back control of the narrative. He said looking at me, he can just see me at 16 — i.e. I look like a terrified child, as I had at the time of the events that caused the PTSD. But I still feel completely shaken up and as if I was the problem.

I’ve been reading since about training methods and his seems all wrong. I know PTSD and my own context factored in a lot in this experience, but I can’t seem to figure out if my distress was fully trauma driven  or if it was an objectively bad experience (maybe both). Either way, I feel deeply disappointed. After all these years I thought I could handle a situation like this better but I was instantly thrown back into terror even before he touched me. 

I’ve been feeling so guilty and upset since. My puppy seems ok. I’ve been cuddling her non-stop but haven’t been able to sleep and this guy’s face keeps lingering in my mind as if to say ‘I did nothing wrong, this is all you.’

1lz3krn,Anyone have success getting rid of nightmares? (nocturnal PTSD),"I, (35)F am falling apart more and more, have lost my house, primary custody of 2 of my children, can’t get/keep jobs, and things just keep getting worse. It seems there is no bottom to the pit I am in. A huge reason for this is because 99% of my sleep is filled with the most intense nightmares. I wake up traumatized and exhausted, heart pounding, adrenaline pumping, jaw sore from being tensed, etc. because I am truly experiencing more abuse and trauma than I ever have had to endure in real life. My psychiatrist has tried every kind/dose and combination of medication, and things are just not helping. 
Because of this my health has deteriorated, my mental health is never better than white knuckling life but wanting to end it. I truly am refusing to give up solely because my kids need me so they can come home and out of their abusive father’s home. He is abusing them and torturing me with the kids as pawns… Otherwise I would not be able to bear the torment I am going through. My hope is that if the nightmares stop, I could at least sleep, and then have the days to manage what actual trauma life is throwing at me.

1lyhb94,Texas Flooding Trauma,"Hey everyone, firefighter paramedic here local to the area of the Texas flooding and on shift when it went down. I have prior PTSD, but I’m experiencing a bunch of issues since the fourth: nightmares, anger, agitation with everyone around me, struggling to be around civilians, smelling death everywhere even when I’m not around it after days of searching for bodies, hopelessness. I feel like my city and my department let down our community with a delayed response, and they would not deploy us or mobilize us during the disaster. We had to self dispatch to low water areas and my crew and I just started pulling people out of locations in high water while people were screaming for help going down the river. After the water receded we just started looking for people, saving one kid that was still alive.. but I’ll never forget the little pink life jacket I saw 30 ft up in a tree while I was searching (the bodies that we’ve found are all naked from the water.. so the child was ripped from this life jacket)… just so many sights sounds and smells are haunting me right now. But I have so much anger. We were failed by our department, they did not brief us on the floods, they weren’t prepared to even handle the floods, we were understaffed, then not mobilized. Then we were made to sit at our station all day… while there were children out there still alive at this point. No briefing at all, we had to wait until 3 pm on the fourth to listen to the public press conference on the news to know the gravity of what was going on. Meanwhile departments 1 hr away from our community were briefed, staffed, and mobilized ASAP to come and help… but we didn’t know. I work for the most clicky department too, so even after the disaster people are still excluding people.. not asking if their okay.. and still treating people like shit. No mental health help, no CISM, no after action report, no updates, not a word from our chief… no comraderie… nothing. 

Then there’s civilians out there playing SAR responder with no training, showing up with their phones and using our disaster as a backdrop for their selfies. 

I’m in a horrible place mentally and I can’t stand to be around anyone. I know this is a unique case, but if any other first responders/ military have experienced these feelings, please let me know what you did to help them. If I seek treatment sooner than later will these feelings not last forever? I don’t even know what kind of treatment to seek out. My brain feels like mush….

1lyk2s6,Has anyone else experienced something like this with a favorite video game after trauma?,"This is really hard for me to talk about with people close to me, so I’m turning to Reddit in hopes someone else might understand.

I was in a severely abusive relationship for two years, one that nearly cost me my life more than once. During that time, one of my main ways of coping and dissociating when he wasn’t around was by playing Skyrim. It became a kind of safe space for me when he wasn’t home.

The thing is, Skyrim was one of my favorite games for years, but ever since I got out of that relationship (more like escaped), I haven’t been able to play it the same way. It’s been about 7 years now, and every time I try to start a new game, I get this overwhelming sense of exhaustion. I can usually make it through the opening sequence: fleeing the dragon and reaching the first dungeon, but then it hits me. I either fall asleep on the spot (I think it might be fainting) or have to pause and go lie down for a few hours. It’s not just being tired, it’s the kind of sleep where I wake up completely disoriented.

Oddly enough, if I push past that initial part, I can play for a bit, maybe an hour or two, but then it happens again. It’s like my body just crashes.

I’ve talked to my therapist about it, and the only explanation she’s been able to offer is PTSD. But even then, this reaction feels so physical and specific that I’m left wondering if anyone else has ever experienced something like this; Especially tied to a game that used to bring comfort.

Has anyone else had this kind of reaction? I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts or experiences.",1752381282.0,4,3,ptsd,ptsd
1ly8cw5,Does this sound familiar to anyone else? Chronic muscle tension that seems to never go away.,"I'm a combat veteran with PTSD. I guess I'm at the point of trying to determine if my chronic muscle tension is a byproduct of my PTSD, or if I should start looking into the root cause as being something other than this. 

I've had PTSD for almost 20 years now. I recall being ""hyper alert"" since day 1, but I only started to notice this extreme tension over the last 5-10 years or so. 

I *can* consciously relax my muscles while intentionally trying, but it takes a lot of effort to do so. It will stay relaxed while I'm actively concentrating, but it's right back to being majorly tense within 30 seconds to a minute of stopping this conscious thought process. I also cannot focus on multiple muscle groups at a time. For example, I will try to relax my TMJD. After a bit, I can relax it. But when I try to move on down the line and try to relax my neck or traps, the jaw is tense again. It's like my ""natural"" state is locked in a default state of constant tension. 

And being tense is not all. I'm sure it's because of the tension, but I have major muscle knots/trigger points all over my body. I've had trigger point injections on a few of these places, and it does work to release the muscle. But insurance does not want to cover to the extent that I feel is needed. Getting 3 out of potentially 20-30 locations is not really doing much. Sure, major relief comes in those areas. But the rest of my body is so tense, that within months of receiving these injections, the knots are back. 

In addition to the knots, many of my ""long and narrow"" muscles in my arms, legs, and neck feel like tree branches, because they are so hard. 

I meditate, stretch, to yoga, been going to physical therapy for over 3 or 4 years now, chiropractic for over 5 years...and I really don't feel hardly any relief from this tension. I've been on many different meds over the years. I've tried acupuncture, dry needling, massage, some sort of cold laser therapy, 6 sessions of IV Ketamine therapy (the last two being completely out of pocket, to the tune of over $3,000, just to give you an idea of what lengths I'm willing to go to in order to *possibly* find some sort of relief). My issues persist, and it's not from lack of trying on my end. My wife is also going to massage school in order to try to help me. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone else out there?",1752347170.0,13,19,ptsd,ptsd
1lyeyrp,I wish I was more resilient,"I was in a bad car accident last year, driving home from visiting my mother's grave. I was injured very badly, broke so many bones, needed surgeries. I'm going to need more surgery. My partner broke up with me in the hospital, I don't have any family, I've been dealing with stuff alone and I've been completely overwhelmed. After being in the hospital for many months, being in a wheelchair for many more months, I'm using a walker now and can mostly walk on my own, except when the pain & stiffness is bad or when I get really dizzy which happens easily. I can feel the metal they put in me, it makes me cringe, reminds me of everything, often feels like I'm crawling out of my skin.


I go to trauma rehab three times a week for many hours, I have more appointments (hospital, pain clinic, neurology, trauma psychology, etc) than I have time for. I'm terrified of being in cars, I'm unbearably anxious and re-traumatized anytime I have to travel, even though I'm using MVA Transportation with professional drivers. I don't like letting people into my living space (been assaulted and harassed here- also embarrassed by the mess and the clutter). I like having my private space, where I won't be judged or hurt. Being in the hospital for so long without that was brutal. I'm good at making friends and talking to people, but I always put walls up and I don't let them in, metaphorically and physically.


I was already diagnosed with CPTSD (complex post traumatic stress disorder), and have PTSD from so many things that have happened throughout my adult life. I don't really have a support system, I was always used to being self-reliant, I did things myself since I was a child. I never thought this would happen, that I'd be in this position. I've made friends with a lot of people at rehab, most of whom have significantly worse injuries than I do (missing limbs). I noticed that they all seem to have some kind of family and support. My physical therapists kept telling me to ask family/ friends/ neighbors for help with certain things, but I don't feel I have that option. I've never been good at asking for help, and I have a history of pushing people away. When I would ask how to figure things out on my own, they would shrug and say I'm in a ""unique"" situation they've never seen before. I had a case manager for a short time that was judgmental and terminated services after I had a breakdown and told her I wanted to die.


Some friends who have lost limbs from motorcycle accidents talk about wishing they could get back on their bikes. They don't seem to have the same trauma that I do, they're not afraid at all to be in cars. I know that the psychological stuff I'm experiencing is making everything so much worse, it's been making my physical recovery very difficult and slow. I've been so depressed, I have horrifying vivid nightmares every night, I wake up drenched in sweat with a complete sense of dread, and it's so hard for me to get out of bed or move. I was totally independent before the accident, I was happy, I had a life (friends, a job, a purpose, my independence), I had a future. My partner and I had been talking about getting married and starting a family. It feels like I lost my life.


I have days where I don't believe it's real. I think I died, am in a coma, or woke up in some sort of alternate / false reality. I wish I could be as resilient as the other people at rehab. I don't really understand what's wrong with me, why I can't be like them. I think my history makes it harder for me to be strong, to be positive. I've had so many times throughout my life where I was doing well, I was getting somewhere and then had a major setback, subsequently losing what I had or any progress I had made. In the past, I would exercise for hours most days, it was a good distraction and way to regulate my nervous system. Not being able to do that for almost a year, I'm having trouble coping.


Do other people that have suffered severe PTSD also feel like it's hard to bounce back from things? How do people with this history deal with setbacks and additional traumas? How do people deal with ongoing triggers and constantly being re-traumatized? I desperately want to be more resilient. I want to be okay, maybe even be happy again. ",1752365077.0,5,1,ptsd,ptsd

1ly540n,I keep making bad decisions in lucid trauma dreams,"I found this subreddit by searching around to see if anyone has had a similar experience to me, but all I could find is posts about how people were using lucid dreams to improve their PTSD nightmares. I don't normally lucid dream, I'm on lunesta 3mg which has started to cause it. I actually started the medication because my trauma dreams made me so adverse to sleep that I would avoid it as much as possible or try to microsleep when I couldn't avoid it, and it affected my ability to go to work.

My current most frequent trauma dream is influenced by both PTSD and CPTSD.

Every time I have a lucid trauma dream, I make the same choices as I did in the actual event. I feel like I'm making the wounds even deeper than when I had trauma dreams without any control over my actions in them. Sometimes, I act on those choices more intensely, more angrily, than I did in the actual event. It's like a condensed form of the last 2-3ish years of my experience with my ex being played out in thr duration of a single dream, so it's the full emotional rollercoaster.

I keep reliving scenarios about my ex, but the exact environments and details vary each time. At the start, I'm influencing my actions in my dream without the knowledge of what will happen if I pursue him, but with the gut feeling that something WILL go wrong. I always choose to try to be with him and ignore my gut feeling. But throughout the dream, no matter how it actually plays out (sometimes I see it happening or I just get overwhelmed by the feeling of it), I perceive him abandoning me. At that point, something in me is so deeply triggered and I get a waterfall as all the emotions I felt from the most abusive/traumatic moments with him start flooding back as if they happened during the dream (whether I see them happening or not.) It's like a flashback within a trauma dream. And I have to navigate what to do with those feelings all over again.

Only one time have I ever had this dream and chosen to move on and do something else. Every other time, I confront him. I stare him down with anger and betrayal in my eyes in a way I never got to. Sometimes I yell at him the feelings I held back from telling him because when I left him in real life, I knew I couldn't express my anger or sadness because it would snowball into babbling about how much I loved him when that was a sentiment he no longer deserved to feel from me. I don't have control over his reactions in my dreams, but he never feels guilt, much like in real life. Every time I have these dreams, he runs away, but I guess it's satisfying when I confront him and sometimes I see that he is at least scared of the consequences of his actions when he cowers away, even if he doesn't feel bad about them. But the lack of guilt, apology, or even empathy for the pain his actions caused me leaves me feeling just as horrible as I did when it really happened.

I woke up today blaming myself for being given the ability to lucid dream yet always going down the same path with the same guy. I already know that if I was given the opportunity to try again with him, I would, despite logically knowing how emotionally abusive and damaging he was to me. But because he brushed up on this deep CPTSD abandonment wound, the only thing my nervous system wants is to go back to being with him. But I keep seeing what happens when I make that choice, over and over in my dreams. And I keep making it. It doesn't even make me want to stay away from him when I wake up, because it feels like the only thing that could take away this feeling is going back to him (even though I logically know it would be worse!!!)

1lxzi9i,Help after mugging / assault,"Hi, I'm hoping to get some advice/ideas on what I can do post a mugging and assault incident.

I live in London, and about 3 weeks ago when after I had closed up the bar I now used to work at, I was mugged and assaulted. I was flung against a wall, with the man eventually cutting open my shirt and bra. I did try a few self-defense mechanisms, such as kneeing him in the groin, biting his palm when he was covering my mouth to silence my cries for help, but that only made him angrier. He had a knife, and made a few cuts to my cheek and all over my chest as well. I'm lucky that there were no other injuries other than that, and after he made the cuts, he just took my phone, wallet and AirPods before taking off.

The day after this happened, I had to go open that same bar and mentally couldn't be there. I have since stopped working at that bar, as I was already being let go and during one of my shifts last week again, it was just too mentally traumatizing for me to be in that area.

I have been trying to keep myself distracted by doing things such as hanging out with good friends, and go to places I know I feel safe in. My friends and boyfriend have been a blessing through this and have helped keep me distracted by doing things such as taking me to the beach for a girls' day, keeping me busy, etc. 

However, I am getting tired of trying to pretend I'm ok when really I am not. I have random flashbacks of what happened, and sometimes even trying to be intimate with my boyfriend mentally seems impossible. He has been so incredibly supportive, and has always let me know that I am safe with him / wherever we go, and has been letting things go at my own pace, whatever I am comfortable with. I had about 2 weeks of distracting myself and not talking about it as much, but this third week has been more difficult, and I know I am not myself.

I've met with a counselor, and she said based on what I told her, she reckons that I have PTSD. I unfortunately can't be her client because she knows me socially (my boyfriend knows her, and we've met before) , but she is recommending me to another clinic that she trusts. It's only been a few days since we met so I expect it'll be a while before I hear anything. 

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for dealing with PTSD from an accident like this? I am at a loss for what to do next besides talking to a therapist. I feel mentally low most days, and am trying to hide my depression from everyone around me, which has become even more mentally exhausting. Would appreciate anyone's insights/advice.

1lxs0ve,"I went through a traumatic event when I was 22, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get away from it.","When I (26m) was 22, my best friend was murdered by a man. He was shot in the head with an AR15. I remember the night it happened, but I wasn’t there, I was working. Police originally labeled it as accidental, but I lived with my friend and his roommate for a while when I was 20 and couch surfing and I saw how he acted with guns. He pointed one at me and dry fired, and when I asked him to stop, he laughed at me. I’d never met anyone before that who I knew was just bad. Evil. Absolute lack of empathy or caring for life. 

Anyway, I called the police the day I found out and I told them about his tendencies with firearms. They locked him up, but he was bailed out. 

My deceased friend’s stepfather spoke with me at the funeral. He pulled me aside and asked me if I knew anything that he hadn’t been told. I hadn’t been planning on saying anything to him just because I didn’t want to confuse him with things that may or may not be true, but he pressed me for information and I told him that I had contacted police. I was the one who turned it from an accident to manslaughter. 

After that, I worked on getting other witnesses to go to the police with information, as well as supporting my friend’s ex girlfriend, whom I had to talk off the edge a couple of times, and stepfather, who called me on a daily basis asking for any new information I might have. A few people were too scared to say anything, but after some persuasion and promising that I’d keep her safe, I was able to get the killer’s ex girlfriend to come forward. 

Honestly, I used her. I didn’t actually care about her. I was there for her and I supported her, but only because she was useful to me and I needed her to help me get justice for my friend. Otherwise, and to this day, I still don’t care about her and I don’t think she’s a nice person. I also didn’t like my friend’s ex, but I took care of her because he loved her. In a way, I guess it was penance for not being able to save him and get him to move in with me before he was killed. 

Court took a year and a half. So for a year and a half, I made sure that the killer’s ex was okay and up to par to testify with me, as well as checking in on my friend’s parents. 

People started calling me a hero for being the one who orchestrated all of it, taking the killer down. I know I’m the one who did it. I get that. The attorney even told me that. I don’t want to be the hero in a story that never should’ve been written though. It’s like being given an award for a competition you went into knowing you’d already lost, and then being celebrated for it after. A victory tour for the one of the most traumatic events of my life. It’s so isolating. It’s another thing that I feel disconnects me from the rest of the world. It’s been almost four years, I moved almost 300 miles away, and I just ran into someone from that time tonight. Not a bad person, but nostalgia in a bad way. I can search my name on the internet and the incident is the first thing that pops up. Employers see it when they perform background checks on me. I’m never going to be able to get away from this. I feel that loss over again, and then I realize how lonely I am in that experience. Nobody else in that situation had to take all of that on their shoulders. Nobody else did. I was alone. I did it myself. I don’t wish it on anyone to be able to understand, but damn is it isolating. ",1752296102.0,7,1,ptsd,ptsd

1lxq5uy,I don’t know. Just needed to get this out.,"( CW for verbal abuse & also development of kinks because of trauma. )

I’m fairly new to this sub, but I feel the need to share my story here. I might end up deleting it if I get shy, but for now I just want to know I’m not alone

I ( 20F ) have been homeschooled ever since I was in 7th grade. 

Grade school was fairly horrible to me, but somehow I made it through. Though now that I’m grown, I’ve been coping with the fact that things the teachers and others did to me was not okay. 

I obviously wasn’t the smartest kid in the class ( B and Cs ) , but I genuinely think my reading teacher in 4th had it out for me. I failed one of her tests, was dragged outside into the hallway & yelled at while I sobbed & said I’m sorry. One of the main things I remember her doing is yelling back with “ you should be! “ 

Other smaller but still fucked up things she did was threaten me with summer school when I didn’t bring a book to read in computer class. Or singling me out & yelling at me in front of the class when I was just trying to fix my water bottle. 

I was pulled out of the school system in middle school, but that was only after my mother learning that I had a panic disorder. I would throw up & get nervous to go into the school each morning, only to get berated at home & yelled at to “ stop making myself sick. “ when I didn’t know what my body was doing or how to explain it. 

I don’t know. It’s not all of it & not super ( for lack of better words ) extreme, but the way this stuff affects me is very real. I still have trust issues when it comes to other females who are in a position of authority. I often fantasize about female fictional characters taking care of me in a mommy kink context because, in my head, they would treat me better than most girls in my life ever did. 

I know I probably sound weird or strange, but I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. Just had to get it out

I've been putting this off for way too long. I haven't seen a doctor in almost 10 years due to medical trauma, severe paranoia, and a lack of insurance. 

I'm absolutely scared out of my mind. I know I need to go but I'm afraid between now and Tuesday I'll convince myself to back out.

I think it'd help a little to know what to expect. The clinic I'm going to is a free one but I don't know much beyond that. Will I need to provide proof of my lack of insurance and poor financial state? Should I bring anything else besides an ID? 

I don't have anyone who can accompany me to make the experience less distressing. I'm trying to read about people's experiences in the hopes that I feel slightly less panicky, maybe I won't break down into tears or worse – back out of going at all.

1lxn1b6,I’M STRUGGLING,"I have been dealing with CPTSD for the past year and half, a lot of it was childhood trauma but the main reason I was officially diagnosed is because I was cheated on in a relationship that is 8 years long. We pushed through it, and are now married but my CPTSD lately has been literally ruining my marriage and life. 


We are starting couples therapy and I was in individual for a while but it just wasn’t helping a ton for the price I was paying so I stopped. 


Half the time I feel nothing, unable to cry or really feel attached to anything/anyone. Then I’ll get these random bursts of rage, paranoia, despair. Whenever I am triggered it’s bad. I will pretty much be bombarded with intrusive thoughts, start to shiver, scratch myself, I sometimes even see shadows etc. or hear things as if my thoughts are screaming at me. This happens when I’m triggered by my husband related to the cheating stuff. I hate it. Sometimes I’ll start random arguments with him when I’m triggered, and I end up saying a lot of shit that’s mean, and I feel so guilty afterward. Even if I’m not directly “triggered” I find myself bringing out old things and getting super angry about it. 


I’m at a loss. We see a couples counselor on Monday. But I feel like such a fucked up person like I’ll never be the same.

I recently saw a psychiatrist for about 30 minutes and was prescribed Prozac for a mix of PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and depression. I’ve struggled with intense panic and daily anxiety for years, and currently manage some of it with Xanax and propranolol.

Here’s the thing: my therapist had me take an ADHD assessment and said I scored in the 90th percentile, but this was never brought up or addressed by the psychiatrist. That feels like a pretty big thing to overlook, especially since ADHD might be a core piece of the puzzle.

To make matters worse, I’ve tried SSRIs before (Celexa and Zoloft) and absolutely hated how they made me feel—more anxious, emotionally flat, foggy, disconnected, etc. I’ve also tried Adderall and Ritalin in college and didn’t enjoy those either, so now I feel like I’m stuck in this limbo where nothing feels safe to try.

I’m honestly terrified to take Prozac. I’m scared it’ll make my anxiety worse or that I’ll lose my sense of self again. But I’m also scared of doing nothing. The panic and mental spirals are exhausting me.

I guess I’m asking:
	•	Has anyone had a similar experience with being misdiagnosed or partially diagnosed?
	•	Should I find a new psychiatrist or go back and tell my current one that she may have missed something major?
	•	And if you’ve had success with Prozac in a similar situation, how long did it take to adjust? Was it worth pushing through the early side effects?

1lxm743,Re-evaluating what happened 20 years ago is driving me crazy,"One of my best friends took my virginity when I was 20(F, but they/them please) and he was 19. I was wasted, and so was he. Some people have said it was rape, and Im struggling with that. I have CPTSD from child abuse and my trauma reactions to sex and even gynecology and to remembering this have gotten worse. I have had other SA experiences. 

I dont want to trigger anyone with details, but I feel like it's important, so here are some moments I remember that can show how I have conflicting feelings:

- He ended up, shortly after this, dating a kid who was at most 15. I told him that was wrong, but I think I could have done more. The kid's parents, one was a cop, allowed it. 
Our community failed that kid. But it also goes to show he was a creep to other people. 

- A third party had suggested he assault me once when I was passing out. That same guy was there the night this happened, asleep, and I wonder if they planned it.

- He gave me some mystery pills (I was an addict). He also took some. We both got very drunk.

- As I was passing out beside him, I woke up to him basically using my hand to stimulate himself. There was no consent to this act at all. So this part was definitely SA. I havent really processed that.

- He left the room, I followed him, he initiated sex. I dont know if I was asked or said yes, I don't remember. 

- I dont think I completely hated it the whole time. I think I had mixed feelings about it. I remember a moment of giggling. 

- He did not use protection. He said he wanted to (and maybe just an additional trigger warning here) come inside me and I said you cant. He said I know. but I remember being really scared. 

- I dont think I would have let this happen sober if asked. I dont think he would have asked me sober. I was not considered attractive to date in our friend group, and I wasn't interested in him or in sex. 

- He ordered me to do some stuff and some of the time I was mentally/physically unable. 

- I passed out at the end. I dont know if he stopped. 

- he claimed not to remember anything the next day the second I talked to him so I just didnt tell him what happened. I just wanted things to go back to normal. 

- Other than that I remember feeling kinda normal about it, proud Id finally lost my virginity even. I had felt weird about not even wanting to have sex so it felt like a relief it was over with. 

- I told my sister, she made a joke about me missing my period, he hit on her ""as a joke"" (she was like 16, so gross), I got mad, I went home and had a meltdown, and went to a mental hospital. 

- I mostly stopped seeing or talking to him after this. I moved away from this toxic friend group. 

- years later when I came out as queer (revisiting the old neighborhood briefly) he made a comment that he should never have sex again, which to me only makes sense if he did know, and I ""joked"" that he didnt seem to have much self control. 

- I have had other SA experiences and over time Ive had some PTSD responses to sex. I cant have any penetration. I have had times Ive melted down. I have meltdowns whenever I see a gyny, which I mostly avoid. I also have an issue w going to get a colonoscopy bc of this. Even thinking about getting penetrated can cause meltdowns.

- the only time I brought it up in therapy, I mentioned I lost my virginity and she congratulated me. Which felt weird. When I said it went on for a long time, she acted like that was impressive as if it meant the sex was good. I found that really confusing because I felt like I wanted it to end and didn't understand why it took so long. I didnt feel like it was good sex. 

- There was one act he tried and when it hurt too much I said no and he did stop. So Ive always thought if I just said no, maybe he would have stopped. 

So... I have never called this rape. And with so much other problems, Ive never thought of it as part of my trauma or processed it as trauma. And when all these people said it was rape I had a huge breakdown and that's lasted two nights where I obsess about it and cant sleep. 

I dont know if the rules permit me to ask yall to answer ""is it wrong to call this rape?"" but that is my question to myself. And a counselor probably wouldn't answer it either. Everyone will probably say its up to me. And I feel very resistant to that. It feels unfair. However if someone said this happened to them and it was rape, I would NEVER question or shame them.

So idk what do yall think? support, advice? thanks. ",1752277916.0,0,2,ptsd,ptsd

I probably have cptsd, though I'm not officially diagnosed, but I take medication for my mental health problems that usually help me on a day to day basis, so unofficially diagnosed, I guess?
Anyways this morning, I had a really bad nightmare, which I get sometimes and usually shake off, but this one honestly shook me so bad that when I woke up, I was not feeling good whatsoever

So I called mu boss to call in sick today, she stated I needed to get a doctors note that day since I'm on ""probation"" since I'm new and how she has to find someone to cover my shift then hung up on me, to which then I had an absolute panic attack and it took me almost two hours to calm down.
I don't have a primary doctor and my insurance won't cover a walk in clinic or ER visit plus I don't have a ride for that since I'm saving up for a car, and after some texting my boss hasn't responded after saying she needs to make some calls and talk to her boss... it's been an hour.

I don't exactly need this job, but I like having one, but I think this episode was caused by being so stressed out at work and dealing with my boss, I am going back onto the job market and find another job that isn't a total pain in the ass.

EDIT: Also, to note, I have this anxiety thing where I pass out, nothing wrong with me, and usually I can manage my stress and anxiety well fo the most part and it's pretty rare now.

The instructor was shouting a lot, and encouraged us to use more strength and be more aggressive during the training, which I think there is good reason. I know if the need arises to use the training, it would be important to have a good understanding. However, upon hearing and joining conversation, it was a little excessive. The instructor looked a lot like my attacker which I think is what triggered me. I fully went into dissociating. I had a flashback for the first time in several years. I’m not sure at this point if I should offer feedback to the facility or if they will view that as a weakness or a reason to try to fire me. To be clear, it was his first time leading the training.

1lx58hp,Responding to Hypercriticism,"Hi. I have a family member with military-related PTSD. When they are triggered ( usually by chronic pain and/ or anxiety) , their behaviors include hypervigilance — they notice ANYTHING even slightly not right, whether it’s a picture hanging a few millimeters askew or someone whose shirt collar isn’t lying properly or the faintest odd sound outdoors — and hypercriticism — finding fault with everything and taking offense at anything. I have seen them make baristas and counter people cry by suddenly blowing up at them for a minor mistake on an order; they will take an innocent comment that had nothing to do with them and perceive it as a personal insult; they will  threaten people with various ( nonviolent) retribution for minor slights or mistakes or even perceived but not real “ disrespect.” 

This behavior only manifests itself occasionally. The person is conscious that it happens, and is usually embarrassed and contrite, but often doesn’t seem to remember their exact words/ behaviors; for them it’s like trying to remember a dream, even if it just happened. 

My question, to people with PTSD: If you are having an acute episode, is there anything other people can say or do to help you out of that state ? This person will often say others are being condescending, if they sound too much like therapists. They say they wish someone would just tell them to stop — although in reality that often makes them angrier. I have been on the receiving end of this person’s ire, and frankly I don’t  know how to respond. I usually just shut down, because in my experience it doesn’t  matter what I say or do…. If I say I’m sorry, they’ll say, “ No, you’re not”; if I quietly try to fix whatever sensory issue is causing the outburst, they say, “Never mind — it’s too late now.” I have some of my own childhood trauma to deal with, so these interactions often trigger memories of that. This person functions normally, even better than normally, most of the time, and when they are triggered it’s very disorienting. Help! ",1752235836.0,1,2,ptsd,ptsd

1) Mental abuse
2) Physical abuse (moderate and stopped as i turned 15)
3) +10 year of extreme bullying, betrayals, and close friends leaving my life or even humiliate me (i went through 68 fights in my entire life, barely initiated any, most these fights were when i was 9-14 years old)
4) War (happened first in 2011 when i was 4 or 5 years old, i remember some memories and i was never scared, it happened again in 2024 and I didn't feel any traumatic flashbacks or fear as well)
5) Social anxiety and severe loneliness 
6) Identity confusion
7) Emotional negligence (which involved me in several emotionally dry moments in an early stage of my life but i don't think i can talk about it, but i discovered porn when i was 8 and remained addicted on masturbating for 7-8 years due to lack of emotional connection)
8) Cyberbullying (moderate or less)
9) Dissociation 
10) Ignorance (because i was never taught anything by my parents or anyone else, i was always told to man up and punch back whomever punches me, i can say this factor contributed in making my maturity slower)
11) Rage problems & Cowardice 
12) Toxic family environment where low emotional intelligence, low validation of feelings, and constant problems

Background: my sister has been in an abusive relationship with the father of her kids for about 10 years, physically and emotionally. More recently she’s been physically abusive to him to get back at him for his abuse to her. 

Recently my family had to evacuate her and her children out of the state, after she was on a three day alcohol bender at a random guys house who assaulted and beat her. My parents wanted to get her somewhere safe for her and kids so she could get sober. 

Now she hates all of us, spends most of her time screaming at everyone and refuses to help herself, doesn’t want to get better, and doesn’t think she even has a problem. 

She doesn’t have any health insurance at the moment and is in severe debt on top of it all. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to manage with a family member at this point of trauma? We’ve been dealing with it for ten years now and it’s reached a point where I don’t know how to continue to help her, when she’s so mentally unstable she doesn’t even know what reality is anymore.

Last Sunday, my ovary decided it wanted to get out of my body and flipped itself twice, creating an ovarian torsion. And it took my fallopian tube down with it. 

I went to the ER on Thursday in so much pain. Puking, screaming, not able to bear it. They gave me morphine, Dilaudid twice, and sent me home with Norcos and no answers since ""I didn't respond to pain medication"". 

I spent Friday just drowning in pain medication and not moving. Saturday the pain exploded. I was screaming in the ER, shaking, puking, refusing care. Got so many pain meds via IV and nothing helped. I don't remember much thankfully, but I remember screaming and all the pain meds I could feel washing around the painful area but not helping at all. I just remembered sitting there pale, outside of my body, with my poor husband just trying to get someone to listen. Finally I saw an OB who took me into surgery and found the issue and took out my ovary and fallopian tube. I wasn't expecting that or another major surgery (I've had two). 

She came in the morning and apologized for the ER staff. She said she talked to them about the issue and scolded/educated them for the next time this happens. I have been on the ""we are using this as a learning experience"" side of shit too many times. She said no amount of pain meds would have ever helped and they shouldn't have turned me away. 

I am angry, I am sad, I can't get the hallowing, terrifying pain out of my head. I feel like a shell. Like I'm just sitting here staring at the wall. The pain I experienced was unlike anything, I feel depleted and like life is different now. I can't explain the horrible feelings I went through during this time. I thought I was going to die, and I was actually pretty close due to being septic. 

Now I don't know how to process. My husband said I might have PTSD and maybe should see a therapist but I feel silly being so affected after this situation. It's just so weird to be here now because the pain made everything else in life seem so small and fake. How do I move on? Is this something that will go away eventually or should I pursue some help?

1lx3vgp,[URGENT!] Had a terrible experience related to singing (from 2019) and I can't take it - I'm going to musical camp later this month and I'm TRAUMATIZED; PLEASE HELP!!!,"In 2019 I went to a musical camp (from 7/31 - 8/2) and it was my WORST camp trip ever.

That's because on the day before the camp  (7/30) I woke up sick with a sore throat. But on that day it wasn't that bad so I decided to just let go of it. UNFORTUNATELY, however, on 7/31 I actually got the cold. I basically lost the highest part of my range. On the way to the place where the musical camp takes place we took a stop and I had some medicine. Yet, my singing voice barely went back to normal at all (now the highest notes do sound, but only like airy hoarse shit). Yet, I couldn't cancel the camp nor leave early. 

I took those medicines throughout the camp, waiting for my voice to fully return back to normal as soon as possible.

Later that day I was in a singing event and I sang some songs that I liked. My highest notes still sounded like shit (although better than not being able to sing out those notes at all!). I was quite disappointed over not being able to sing properly, but here's what REALLY fucked everything up:

**THEY HAVE ALL BEEN LAUGHING SO FUCKING HARD AT ME AND RECORDING A VIDEO OF ME SINGING WITH THAT STRANGE VOICE, AND IT HAS GONE SO VIRAL AMONG THAT COMMUNITY. NOW I AM KNOWN AS ""THE CRAPPY SINGER"" SINCE THEN - TO THIS DAY.**

Well, the root cause of my illness was likely the prolonged rainstorm weather (which was still in effect throughout that entire 2019 camp!). **IN THIS CASE I SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT FOR HOME EARLY!!**

Only **AFTER** the rainstorm season had fully ended (which was around 8/7/2019), I have fully recovered and was able to sing as normal again. It took about an entire WEEK for me to recover from that rainstorm sickness.

But even AFTER that, those people (nearly) always now refer to me as ""THE CRAPPY SINGER"" and some of my ""crappy singing"" videos are now EVEN ON YOUTUBE!!!!!

1lw8kw7,healing hurts more than being broken ever did.,"It's funny - Somehow it seems like healing hurts more than being broken ever did.

I spent years just surviving. I put on a brave face and did what I needed to get by. But then it hit me all at once. The mask cracked. All the bad stuff I'd been running from finally caught up - the hurt, the loss, everything that happened to me that I never asked for. And right when I needed them most, people started backing away. They said I was ""too intense"" or just disappeared altogether.

These days I'm trying to fix myself. Got sober. Started writing. Making art. Looking hard at who I really am under all the fake stuff I used to hide behind. Sometimes I get these moments where everything feels clear, like I'm finally waking up. But being awake is pretty lonely.

I notice things now that I can't ignore - how fake everyone acts, how we're all supposed to look perfect and busy all the time. Meanwhile everyone else seems fine living that way, as long as things look good on Facebook or Instagram. That's the worst part - the more real I try to be, the more I feel like I don't fit anywhere. Where do I belong? The disconnection from people in general is hard to escape. 

I'm not trying to throw a pity party. Just wondering if anyone else gets it - what it's like starting over after everything falls apart, trying to build something honest in a world that likes pretty lies.

If you've had to start from scratch after trauma - if you've watched people and parts of yourself fall away - how'd you stay connected? What stopped you from going numb or hiding away again?

The PTSD was directly caused by my former work supervisor. There was an internal investigation, and as a result, he was moved to a different team — but he still works in the same building. It’s a small building with just one restaurant and one café, so avoiding him completely might not be possible.

My PTSD is considered complex because I also had two unprocessed traumas earlier in life. Since the diagnosis, I’ve been in therapy, on antidepressants, and on medical leave. I’ve done a lot of healing work, and I no longer feel afraid of the building itself. I actually feel ready to return.

However… whenever I hear any news about my former supervisor — especially when there’s a chance I might run into him — I get teary-eyed. My body still reacts, even if my mind feels more grounded than before.

My psychiatrist recommends returning to work part-time in three months. I feel generally calm about it, but I know I’ll be anxious about running into him — in the elevator, at the café, entering/leaving the building, during events, etc.

1lw571c,It’s almost like I want to have the flashback?,"I don’t know how to explain this but I have this thing where if I think about what happened too much I can go one of two ways— pushing it aside/down, carrying on and coping as best I can OR giving in and having the flashback. I’ve done enough work that 99% of the time I can actively choose the first but sometimes I don’t because for whatever reason I like…. Want to experience having the flashback. I’ll ward it off until I can get a private moment and then I’ll intentionally go and take that moment and give into it. It doesn’t make me feel good, obviously, but even so it’s like something that in the moment I am almost actively seeking out. 

I don’t know what this is all about. Sometimes I struggle with not feeling connected to what happened to me because it’s been several years. I can talk about it and hear about it and it feels like I’m talking about something that happened to someone else.

You write an impact statement describing why you think the event happened so you can identify your ""stuck points"". I spend all of my time mentally picking apart what happened to me so I can prevent it from happening again. Most of my issues stemmed from a series of offenses from one partner, I opened up about it to another over the span of a few years and over time I did start to feel better/noticed less intense symptoms. Then, against my better judgement, I let this new partner do the exact same thing that the other had. All hell has broken loose in my mind because this wasn't supposed to happen again! I am so devestated.


I'm at a loss now with my stuck points because I feel like if I had stayed ""stuck"" then it wouldn't have happened again. How did I let this happen again? I'm completely bewildered.

1lw6t1e,how have you successfully dealt with male trauma?,"Long story short, I realized I liked women when i was 17, after I’d had some abusive/SA situations with ex boyfriends. at the time, it felt like liberation knowing I wasn’t destined to be with men. I only really saw myself ending up with women from there on out, but about a year ago I fell in love with one of my best friends. They’re gender queer and AMAB. They are truly one of the most amazing, emotionally safe people I’ve ever met and we are so compatible intellectually and emotionally. However, from the get go I was extremely hesitant to engage in a committed relationship because I had such a tunnel vision of my life being with a woman.

Anyway, to get to the point: while initially there was sexual chemistry without a lot of fear, a few months in, the switch flipped and now I usually try to avoid it (this is what happened the last time I dated someone w a male body and I kinda figured it was only afab people from that point on).  

I love my partner dearly and want to make sure I’ve done everything I can to make it work, but this seems like a damn big barrier, especially because I’m still so attached to my identity and sense of safety as someone who only engages w/ women. I’ve been in therapy for a long time and have a wonderful therapist with whom I’ve been doing EMDR with little relief. 

Has anyone successfully worked through their fear of the male body and if so, how did they do it? Or should I just accept I will never have a fulfilling s*xual relationship with this person and only date women again? ",1752133346.0,1,1,ptsd,ptsd

The first night after, he hit his head lightly and I launched into something I've never experienced before. I was screaming, and all I could see was his grey face. It was like bits and pieces were mixing into what was really happening.

1lvrgoq,My triggers make me feel like a terrible person.,"Hi. Recently i got into my first healthy relationship with a sweet man who hardly ever yells at me. But, if he does raise his voice, i clam up. 
I never realized i had so much trauma with men raising their voice till now, but it makes sense in hindsight. i didn’t have a very good childhood, it was mostly filled with a lot of anger. And after that, i was only ever in relationships with women so i guess i never noticed? But i digress.. That’s not the issue here. 
The issue is that he cant even change his tone of voice or get annoyed or angry with me without feeling like he did something wrong, because 9 times out of 10, i end up going quiet for the next hour.. stuck in my thoughts, usually crying. I feel like that’s not fair to him, and that makes me feel guilty that i’m not giving him his allowance to be angry like he gives to me.
I’ve just been so used to unhealthy relationships where it’s ALWAYS yelling, but it’s almost never yelling with him. So when he does yell…well it freaks me out. And now i feel like IM the toxic one in this relationship (as opposed to the other person) 

I just need advice; How do i navigate a relationship while having triggers? because obviously i know that no one is perfect (not even my sweet boy), and that he should be allowed to get angry and upset just as i do (i also have bipolar). But in the same breath, it triggers me badly and sends me to places mentally i don’t like. Should i just suck it up? 

edit: he doesn’t really yell, it’s more of just raising his voice that frightens me. ",1752088322.0,8,31,ptsd,ptsd
1lvynct,how do you learn to talk to people and breathe and feel again,"content warning: ABUSE, dissociation, overall trauma response shi)

I've been in a constant state of intense dissociation most of my life, ever since the worst thing that ever happened to me, when i was a toddler. i had one year of feeling like i was a real living person and not a ghost floating through moments in highschool. it was nice. i feel like such a failure for losing it again. nothing terrible happened, i graduated and lost my hs friends, i subsequently lost my new friends due to a mix of parental drama and depression, i found out i was catfished for 7 years by my best friend, my sister briefly went to jail for reporting our abuser (""she assaulted him"", bit him so he'd let go when he was choking her upside down over  railing)-- nothing like what ive been through before, but it set me back. a bunch. all this year ive been slowly losing it (lost all my friends in the beg8nning of the year so it was pretty easy to slip back into old habits, silence). i want to be that person again that can be fun and interesting, i want to be an actually good friend to have, i want to feel okay once in a while, i want to be able to have fun when i put the effort in. 

i keep trying to hang out with friends and i just cant focus on anything i feel like, like a staticy nonperson, a murdered bride walking through the house seen but unseeing in one of those classic victorian haunting movies, i just, like, i hear what people are saying and i respond and i interact but in this very vague scripted way where i dont remember anything afterwards, people wont immediately be like ""omg are you OKAY"" but will comment that i seem uninterested or unfocused, i wont remember any conversation from when im like that -- even like just a few minutes later. when i do ""snap into it"" (idk how to explain any of this) and feel more myself and try to have a genu8ne fun conversation with someone that i will remember, i find my mind still runs funny and makes it hard to conversate, i wont make sense-- my mind just like, skips back and forth a lot i guess? and moves really fast? i know i kinda trip over my words and ramble and forget the topic  and i just like, dont make sense to people. they'll think im high, my sisters inferred she thinks i might be on hard stuff due to this before and she's experienced with drugs so that's intense. ( full disclosure i do 🍃 but deliberately not when im going to be around other people, because i do not feel safe high around other people as i already feel not fully in control without the additional impairment) i always get at least one incredulous laugh because my brain shoehorned some random word or phrase in that i had absolutely no reason to be thinking.  

the fact that i dont make sense to people when i am focused and try to genuinely add to a conversation, remember like at best 10% of any one week and by this month couldn't even give you an outline of what happened last month, and that people think I'm uninterested and bored the rest of the time i exist -- it all makes it really hard to be able to try to get better. for further context i do have a therapist she is helpful but also unable to fix me and i currently do not know how to speak to her either, and for my past experiences i was effectively selectively mute until i was around 7 and then again for a few years after that, i was only in school for a full year once until highschool, and ive had severe depression and anorexia since i was 10 (although i had disordered eating habits before that they were parent and food tolerance based, not due to my own active choice to starve.) in full been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ocd, ptsd, anorexia possibly stemming from csa

1lvf2bs,Do you have issues with blending people from the incident with current people? Cw: DV,"

I put a NSFW warning because I didn’t know how triggering this could be for some, it messes me up a little to be honest. 
But sometimes I am sitting with my current boyfriend, a wonderful man who I have been with for almost 3 years and will hopefully spend my life with, and something he does triggers me. It could be that he laughs like my ex, or he says something similar. But all of a sudden it’s like he’s blending. 
In the beginning of our relationship it happened a lot, especially if we were in a hotel or a different bed, where I’d wake up and for the first like 10 minutes I’d start planning an escape from him. I didn’t know who he was, I thought he was my ex because of my nightmares. 
That part happens less, but recently if I’m stressed or tired and we’re watching a movie or something and he says something, if I’m not looking directly at him, I can swear my ex is next to me. Not in that I don’t feel safe because of him, but I don’t because of me. I’m trying to work on it, and by that I mean just breathe through it. But that’s obviously not working. I upped my nightly prazosin for the nightmares, I’m still on a super low dose and it does me good. 

I guess what I’m asking is does anyone else experience this level of blending and does anyone have any advice? Thank you! ",1752055967.0,30,13,ptsd,ptsd

1lvoigg,How can I help her with her symptoms?,"Her PTSD is fresh and bad, from an abusive relationship that got worse and worse. The switch flipped recently and it sucks to know that only 2-3 months ago she wasn't fully like this.

I would love some advice on how I can better be there for her in moments when she suddenly wakes from a nightmare, has a flashback, or gets irritated with me over nothing. I've been reading a bit more into how PTSD works and was not aware of certain elements to it.

She says putting a hand on her when she wakes up doesn't help and the only thing that can calm her down is herself, and of course I will respect that. But if there are other ways that I can maybe suggest and see if she'd be willing to try I'd love to know. 

Also when it comes to her random bursts of irritation, I don't exactly know how to approach that. I tend to just withdraw myself and not speak because in moments it does feel like I'm walking on eggshells. I playfully said she liked something that came on cause she was humming/singing the song a couple days prior for hours. So when it came on I jokingly said ""hey you like this one"" and I was met with a random burst of irritation where she was annoyed by me trying to put that on her and that its her favorite (not something I even said). I felt attacked for being playful and she started bringing up stuff that I don't even do anymore , cause Im now mindful of what I do and say around her to not upset her.

1lvpwhq,I passed the course I struggled with!,"This was the hardest period of college for me. Not only my nightmares got worse because of a chem o teacher that triggered me during his classes, but the person who traumatized me reached out to me again. These months were terrible and I think most of us struggle with concentration already.

I couldn't sleep well at night because of everything that was happening, couldn't concentrate and I failed a very important exam (the midterm), got like 4/20. THAT person had texted me the day before.

 I needed a high mark on my final exam to pass the course, aproximately 15/20 which is a lot for me. As I mentioned, the chem o teacher always picked on me in front of the whole class, made me leave several times for being sleepy (this was due to nightmares, insomnia, doing chores because I live alone, my mom can only visit me some weekends). This led to me not doing great in his course, and he also made several comments about that. I haven't presented my diagnosis to the uni because I want to believe I can make it without extra considerations, without my PTSD and my trauma defining me, but a while ago I felt so weak because I thought I couldn't make it, and then all the things the teacher and others said about me would be right.

But today I got my final score and I did it! I got 16!. Surely I'll be passing with the minimum grade even though that last exam was like 20% of the final score BUT a win is a win. I'm crying right now.

1lvlasg,Headache for 3 weeks now,"Hi. I am wondering whether anyone has had or is having a similar experience as me.  I have always got headaches over the last few years - a few bad ones but mostly mild and none lasting more than a few hours.  These become closer together the last few months. 

3 weeks ago I got a bad headache which feels like my head is full and pounding all over like it would explode. After 3 gp visits, pain killers, neck xrays, injections and an IV - my gp has me admitted to hospital with a neurosurgeon referral.  He sent me for an MRI which did not reveal anything.  He then referred me to a neurologist - who sent me for a lumbar puncture much revealed higher than normal csf pressure and said that she hoped the lumbar punctures would relieve enough pressure. I was discharged from hospital a few days thereafter (still with a headache) However one of the side effects of a lumbar puncture is headaches which was then presumed what was still causing it.  

It has now been 2 weeks since I was discharged- and still have the headache which now makes it 3 weeks with my headache.  :(. I feel so hopeless.  

Has anyone perhaps had a similar experience? And possibly diagnosis or treatment which has helped ? I'm not sure whether to go back for a follow up to the same neurologist ? Or see a new one ?

Now that I'm in a relationship with my current boyfriend I feel like I can barely do anything without getting triggered. We've been dating for about half a year but it feels like I keep getting triggered anytime we do anything close to intimacy. I get flashbacks, dissociate, and get just overwhelming terror that it'll end up the same way as my previous relationship. It's like my mind splits into one side that is scared but remembers that my boyfriend's never done anything to hurt me and one side that's just pure fear. I can say no to one or two things but if he asks about another thing after that I panic and shutdown and agree to whatever because I feel like he'll get mad at me or break up over it.

My boyfriend also has triggers from his previous relationships but he's able to handle them more. From what he's said his are mainly entire actions being repeated and mine can just be slight touch in the same spot or getting asked if I want to do a different type of touch after saying no to one, and it sounds like he doesn't get flashbacks as often.

I was in therapy for an entire year (still am in therapy) before even meeting him and I thought I'd learned enough coping skills to manage dating since I wasn't having panic attacks anymore.

1lv5uuq,Hypersexuality in committed relationship,"This maybe should also be flaired with “Venting!” I am really hoping that I have titled/flaired everything in a way that is safe for everyone reading. Mods, please feel free to remove if not! 

For context, I (27F) am diagnosed with PTSD from a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship that I had from ages 16-18. One of the big things I struggled with after this relationship was hypersexuality, particularly in the form of putting myself in unsafe sexual situations. Once I got into therapy and started really working on my PTSD, I gradually started to feel that I had more of a handle on my hypersexuality. At the very least, I stopped physically meeting up with people I shouldn’t have. However, I still continued to struggle with hypersexuality in small ways. I hesitate to go into it here because I really don’t want to be triggering for anyone else by oversharing, but to put it simply, my struggles with hypersexuality never fully went away even when they became far less of a danger to my physical safety. 

About half a year ago, I started dating my best friend. He’s TRULY the best. We have so much fun together, legitimately bring out the best in one another, and are happier together than I ever could have dreamed of being with anyone. He is well aware of my struggles with PTSD and actually is the first person I’ve dated who also has PTSD. We are both at a place in our healing where this is actually a positive for both of us in our relationship, because we’re able to understand each other in ways that feel deeper than the level of understanding I’ve felt from partners without trauma. I (and my therapist, which is always a good sign!!) have nothing but good things to say about him or the way that he treats me. 

However, my hypersexuality has suddenly reared its head in a way that is honestly really freaking me out. I don’t know if it’s because we’re intimate less often now than we were in the beginning of our relationship, or because I’m actually just fully attracted to him and don’t have to grapple with sexual repulsion with him, or because my brain is being self-destructive… I have no idea. I want to be intimate with him way more often than he wants to with me, which should be totally fine. But I get incredibly in my head about it. I convince myself that he’s not attracted to me anymore (he is), or that I’m not doing enough to make him happy (I am). I fall back into my fawning habits. I get incredibly uncomfortable asking for him to help me out, which he has offered to do even if he’s not feeling up to sex at the moment; even if I can bring myself to ask him, I am performative and think mostly about him in the moment. I feel like I’m never getting enough, and then I feel a huge sense of guilt and blame for expecting anything at all, like maybe I’m as bad as my abuser — and then my self-worth plummets, and I feel self-destructive, which makes me feel hypersexual, and it goes back and forth and back and forth. For what it’s worth, this is the worst month of the year for my PTSD, so I always expect things to get a little more difficult. This is a particularly bad year compared to the past few years, though, which is frustrating — especially since I feel like everything else in life is in such a good place. 

With ALL of that said, I guess what I’m asking is if anyone has any insight into this or has experienced anything remotely similar. For those of you who struggle with hypersexuality, do you have any strategies for dealing with that out-of-control way it makes your brain feel?? Any advice for moving forward? Anything that anyone has to offer would be so appreciated! 

Thank you to those of y’all who read through this — it was a lot, and I am really appreciative of your time!

1luyj4j,delusions after my partner took their life,"i had to delete my old account because their family, who hates me, found it and harassed me. so, new account. im also not using general pronouns for this. i dont wanna risk this account being found and then getting harassed again. 

about 2 months ago, my partner took their life in my apartment so after coming home from a walk, i found them. 
they left no note and the weeks leading up to them ending their life, i tried my best to help them in every way i could. 

the image I saw in that house hasn’t left my head. i was diagnosed with ptsd. id spend many nights unable to sleep or waking up terrified because the image replayed itself in my sleep. 

i had to move out of my apartment immediately and back with family. i didnt leave their house for a while because i was convinced id come back to someone dead. i had a hard time using the bathroom for a bit because whenever i tore toilet paper, it reminded me of having to cut the rope to get them down. 

ever since then, i have a hard time eating. not because i dont want to but because im convinced everything i eat is poisoned or out to kill me. exactly a month after they died, a close friend of mine died from extended drug use. (a bit of context, i dont use drugs at all. i tried to get them help.) 

so along with thinking everything is poisoned, i think everyone around me is going to die soon. if i don’t receive a text back from someone for a while, i think they’re dead. 

whenever i eat or drink something, i have a panic attack. i’ve gone days without water because i think the water is poisoned. 

a part of my brain thinks my ex is still alive. 

i’m convinced ill drop dead at any moment. 

and i know these things probably aren’t real but another part of me is absolutely convinced of it. i dont know what to do. i am in therapy and i was debating checking myself into a mental hospital for a bit but those places are very very scary.

in october 2024 i carried out an attempt to overdose on alcohol and other substances i could find. my 2 closest friends and parents were with me and helped me recover. i had passed out multiple times within the first hour and after regaining stable consciousness i admitted what i had tried to do. i was placed into therapy and was beginning to find myself again. i spent multiple weeks improving my mental health after the incident had taken place. i didn't think about it, nor was reminded of what i had done for months afterwards and believed i had fully healed.

however, at the time of writing this post it is july 2025 and i have recently began to experience reminders of what happened. they occur most nights when im trying to sleep. some nights i feel upset and can't stop crying, other nights i feel sick to my stomach at the thought of it and some nights i feel numb to the thought. i have no triggers such as alcohol or medication and im struggling to find a reason as to why i'm suffering post-traumatic symptoms. i don't tend to think about it throughout the day unless im reminded of what happened through people bringing anything relating to the night up in a conversation.

i also find that i cannot sleep in silence and have to have a noise in an attempt to drown out my thoughts as they sound so loud in my head. things such as music, background audio from a tv or the noise of a fan can help but some nights nothing can control these thoughts. i've also struggled with >!self-harm!< quite a lot, however i am over a year clean as of now, and i find myself thinking about turning back to it to try deflect what im thinking.

1luzcf7,Could It Be CPTSD If My Therapist Still Says Depression & Anxiety?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been in therapy for about a year and a half now, working under a diagnosis of depression and anxiety.

But over time, I’ve become more and more convinced that I actually have CPTSD — based on the childhood trauma, flashbacks, constant fear, how I view the world and relationships, and even certain compulsive behaviors or addictions. Everything about CPTSD just fits in a way that depression/anxiety never fully did.

At the start, I didn’t tell my therapist about the trauma, flashbacks, or relationship issues — so I understand why she started with a depression/anxiety diagnosis. But even after I opened up about those things much later, and even after I took Tim Fletcher’s CPTSD self-assessment quiz (and scored high), she still insists that it’s not CPTSD.

She has started using some of Tim Fletcher’s concepts in therapy with me, which I appreciate. But despite all that, she continues to label my condition as depression and anxiety.

The more I learn about CPTSD, the more I feel seen. I just can’t unsee myself in what I’m reading and hearing.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Did your diagnosis evolve over time? Am I just stuck in my head about this?

Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading ❤️",1752006397.0,6,37,ptsd,ptsd

1lv06ct,"Set Myself Free - poetry about war, greif and Redemption","(Respects to everyone fighting battles, internally/ externally.) 

On the shore beside the ocean,
My heart felt—at peace in her, devotion.
Said, “Let me melt—it’s okay to feel emotion.”
A promise I still keep...
Like a baby, soft asleep.
The average mountain ain’t that steep.

Nobody will come and save me.
Do you really think you could persuade me?
I wanna drink, and relish in the reunion... maybe.

Inside my pride—you can’t hide. No more
Found “love” in a metaphor—paid for sex, I texted, fucked a whore.
But in her eyes, it wasn’t me who I saw.
Not surprised—she whispered, “I’m yours...”
We rowed the boat. I set the oars.

Put on my coat—adversity leaking through my pores.
Walked through the mud, so I mopped the floors.
How do I become a man going to war?

How do I feel at home in Afghanistan?
My blood’s flowing—covered in mud, dirt on my hands.
How can life hurt this bad? I ain't even mad.
If anything, I’ve moved past feeling sad.
Glad I made memories with my brothers... I miss the joy I once had.

Thought I was ready to enter their land.
Don’t overact—nothing ever goes as planned.

Friends died, but that’s life—find meaning in every speck of sand.
I slit my neck so I’d understand.

Now I’m back home, and everything feels bland.
I don’t know who I am—I’m not sure.
Tried to confess, but my voice felt impure.
Tried to sleep, but the silence kept shouting more.
So I wandered—heart heavy, laden and sore.

I thought of her—on that distant shore.
The scent of devotion. The peace I ignored.
I threw it away, defending “freedom” through war.
And now I bleed for what I adored.

I stared in the mirror. No medals. No awards.
Words fail to describe the hardships we’ve both endured.
So I lit a candle—not for the dead,
But for the boy who once dreamt before blood was shed.

And the flame didn’t lie—it flickered and stayed.
Said, “You’re not alone. At midday you hone your blade.
But can you look in the mirror and not be afraid?”

So I stood. I prayed. I wept. Pinned the grenade.
At night, I’m crying tears for the warriors who are depraved.

I wrote to her, but it’s too much to send.
How can I love, if I’ve lost my brothers—lost my friends?
Some truths cut deep—too raw to bandage or mend.
Be brave… it’s not the end.
On the shore, beside the ocean

So I’m very stressed.

My doctors are in the process of prescribing medication to help me with my condition and several other mental illnesses that trouble me, but this is the first condition that escapes all logic for me.

I experience memory loss, i am numb to all and every emotions and i can't think about that day even if i force myself to, which i was told by the nurses is another way ptsd can manifest itself.
I barely feel human anymore, i want to get myself back.
Has anyone ever experienced something of this kind? Can i get my emotions back and my memories back? I am hoping in an affermative answer. I wish someone would tell me that this is not permanent and that my heart will not stay still forever. 
I have come to terms that there is changes that are irreversible in the journey of teenage life but i can't help but feel that my life is being stolen from me because of a man that is not facing any consequence whatsoever.

i really expected nothing to come of it, because apart from the FME showing that *something* had taken place, i didn't think it could prove that the event was non-consensual & it would end up being my word against theirs. i know how these cases usually go, and conviction rates are SO low.

one of the things i was preparing for was for the perp to do a ""no comment"" interview upon their arrest. but it turns out that didnt happen.

the investigating officer who is my contact in the police called me this morning and told me the perp was arrested last week and gave corroborating information during their interview, including admissions. it was enough to have them charged with SA by penetration and groping. a report will be made to the courts and it is likely to progress.

I do not know what happened a couple of days ago but I was nearly beaten to death and robbed. Police can't help me because I was found on the street and I don't remember anything. 

My life is at an absolute low and even though I have ssris I want nothing more then just end it all. I've begged for help from all possible providers but because I used to have a good life nobody can help me. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

Everything hurts. I can barely see out of my eyes. I have no one. And all I can think about is just jumping in front of a train but I don't want to be a bother to the people that have to clean up the mess. 

This is not really a cry for help because I know nobody here can change my situation. Tbh I don't even know why I'm posting this. 

Sorry to the people who had to read all this and I hope your lives are going better then mine. 

EDIT; small update I went to the doc and I was already on the max dose of ssri, they gave me 50mg of quetiapine per day and another 100mg to sleep. I hope this will prevent me from spiraling any further.",1751915850.0,2,4,ptsd,ptsd
1ltuzw8,I keep dreaming of new traumatic scenarios,"TW for mentions of various acts of violence, mention of an OD

I was diagnosed with PTSD a couple years ago from a mass violence incident, along with two different anxiety disorders (triple whammy of PTSD, Panic Disorder and GAD, am I right?). However in addition to that vehicle related incident, I've also been ✨lucky✨ enough to have been involved in a >!school shooting!<, and personally witnessed someone >!pass from alcohol poisoning in my home.!< 

Along with the major things I've been through hurricanes, public threats of violence, a lot of stuff in my home life, and I don't know if it's because my brain has been hardwired to expect something horrific to happen at least every couple of years or just generally the mass amounts of anxiety, but it's like suddenly my brain decided I'm not even allowed reprieve in my sleep.

Almost every night for the past month or so I find myself dreaming of a new horrific scenario- >!Friends ODing, bombs, shootings, cars, knives, anything that can cause harm!<, all in a manner that ends up being way too realistic with way too much detail. And the worst part is it's like my brain doesn't even register them as nightmares, but just normal dreams. I wake up like normal, sometimes even in that state where it takes you a minute to realize you're awake, and I just end up dissociated replaying it over and over again as my body slowly wakes up. 

It's like my body has decided the timer is up, and I have to be ready for ""the next bad thing to happen in my life"" or whatever. My PTSD has almost stopped being about my previous traumas and instead have become about the idea of trauma in general, whether I've experienced it or not.",1751896994.0,3,1,ptsd,ptsd

This person also struggles with alcohol — once they start drinking, they can’t stop.

Things were going well until they relapsed. After that, they only replied to a few of my texts. I saw them once — they were in pretty bad shape. Since then, they’ve been reading my messages but not responding, and ignoring my calls. So I stopped reaching out and decided to just wait.

It’s been two weeks since we last talked, and honestly… it’s starting to feel like a silent breakup.

1ltuut0,Struggling with visual triggers.,"TW: SA, Human Trafficking, Drugs, CSA, therapy 

Two to three years ago I went through the worst thing a person can go through. I thought I had made a new friend in my state. Someone who offered to sell me discount weed and watch movies together. I’m a really lonely person in general. Introverted. Socially anxious Impulsive. Shy. So I don’t make or keep friends easily. So even tho this man was 20 years older than me I was so desperate to feel worthy of platonic connection that I ignored every red flag.

We ended up alone together in casinos and that’s when I was coerced into a sex with him that I didn’t want. And that’s where I noticed my rapists were showing up. Like two guys I previously and correctly outed on social media for raping me happened to be showing up at restaurants and casinos where he was. And that’s never happened to me with anyone else.

So I quickly did the math and figured out this person pretending to be my supportive friend was a MOBSTER HUMAN TRAFFICKER !!!! And do you know how unsettling that is?! It really shakes your trust in humanity and self. And like I recognize the red flags I shouldn’t have ignored. I cut contact with him the day I saw my rapist in a restaurant I visited with the weed seller. The rapist falsely claimed I didn’t pay for a bill that my banking app confirmed was paid for. He was using that as an excuse to get me alone again but I got the attention of his AFAB woman coworker and was successfully able to avoid being trapped alone with him. And I consider that the only reason I’m alive and free right now not dead or kidnapped.

WHICH IS INSANE KNOWLEDGE TO LIVE WITH!!! And he walks free. The ex weed seller. The rapists. All because they happen to have more friends and money than me. Which is what it is.

But living with the memories is disgusting. I hope EMDR can help me. I start tomorrow. I just live in fear of this happening to me again because there was zero accountability for these men. Outside of me warning people about them on social media. Which doesn’t do much.",1751896656.0,2,9,ptsd,ptsd

1lttdck,Hyper Vigilance saved my life so I can't get rid of it.,"Sorry if I posted this before but I still haven't found much of a solution. Like two years ago someone I met on a dating app who assaulted me began to stalk me while I was already being kinda groomed and taken advantage of by a creepy weed seller. Yada yada yada the assaulter began to stalk me and I only realized the degree of danger when I was in when he followed me to a restaurant and asked me to go into a back office regarding a a bill I paid for, that my bank confirmed I paid for. I paid the bill twice to avoid being cornered, left the restaurant, cut contact with the weed seller and reported the assaulter to the cops. The cops just giggled tho. Didn't even attempt to talk to the restaraunt. Which is cool. And by cool I mean, confirmed to me that we have a useless criminal justice system in my country and even law enforcement won't help you if you are a survivor. No one will help you. 

And nowadays it's been two years. The men are not in my life. I completed three group therapy day programs to treat all of my complex ptsd from more than one illegal act that was committed against me. And it's kind of working. Because I have not self harmed in months or attempted. And I am doing my hobbies more. 

At the same time, no one can undo the fact that I was raped, my rapists are still out there, still happily employed and popular, and when given the chance to stop them our law enforcement stood by to enable them. If I had done what my assaulter wanted I would have gone alone with him to the back office. But then I might have gotten kidnapped, killed or at the very least raped once again. So I live everyday knowing that not taking someone at face value saved my life. But that sucks. I don't want to have to worry that every stranger I meet is secretly a fucking serial killer psycho mastermind. But I do. I have to. Because my brain knows it's how it survived and wants to keep surviving. For which, I do not blame it. 

I think what happened to me is still happening to other girls. That's part of what is bothering me. The other part is. I can't believe people can be so deceptive and remorseless for so long. I mean, I thought my weed seller was my friend. I opened up to him about overcoming daycare abuse, my loneliness and all he did was take notes on my issues to try to calculate how to best use and abuse me. Grown, full time employed in construction safety management, owning a smoke shop, owning property ass man. With many friends. More friends than me. 

Idk if it's practical to let my guard down considering these people will always be out there. But I also know that I've already leapt to the wrong conclusion about really cool people actually because I feel so let down by my community, and because like I keep saying what happened to me was real. And those people are really out there facing no consequences. 

So I can start EMDR light therapy today. And I do believe it will help. BUT. I fear Ill have my guard up and a eye over my shoulder for the rest of my life. And Ill always be doubting anyone who isn't my family's intentions for me and honesty towards me. Forever. No matter what. And that sucks.  ",1751892731.0,2,1,ptsd,ptsd

1ltlmq8,Triggered by my friendships,"TL;DR: I keep making mistakes and hurting my friends with my isolation/disregulation, and I am looking for advice on how to navigate healthy communication about my symptoms to my friends, without making them worry and feel like I don’t care about their feelings.  

I am still early in my PTSD healing and just did my second round of EMDR. For context, I’m 36f, diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, and MDD (basically the whole alphabet lol). 

Anyways, my first round of EMDR didn’t go so well. I did not have very entrenched coping skills/tools, and basically pushed through all the emotion to “keep going” (thanks sport coaching lol), and I was dis-regulating for almost a week after. My friends were really worried, and so was I. After talking to my therapist, we put the EMDR on hold and worked on my coping skills, etc. and it was really working! The last two weeks, I felt almost baseline normal, even reconnecting with other friends, going out more, even doing laundry!

Last week, my therapist asked if I would be okay with trying EMDR again. I said yes, and we decided it would be best if I prepared for any serious disregulation (isolating, etc). I told my main friend group (who have been amazing and understanding) what I would be doing and asked if anyone was free for a hang the day after therapy or even the day after. They all agreed to help, and we made some loose plans. 

So, the day of my therapy, I had a sports event right after my therapy (about an hour to get ready and drive to it, then playing for about 3 hours). I barely touched my phone, let alone looked at it. And during my games, I turn “do not disturb” on to stop texts as they kill my phone while it’s on the workout mode (it’s an old Apple Watch. *Man, even writing this all out, makes me feel I’m just listing excuses.*

Well, I saw my one really good friend tailgating in the parking lot after the games with her team. I joined and got to hold her baby the whole time, and was feeling amazing and happy. Then I got back into my car and checked my phone. I had a missed call and probably about 10 texts from my friend group asking if I was okay and they were so worried that I had done something. Even my sister messaged me and said she “missed me” which was super unlike her. (I learned later that they had texted her and she used ‘find my friend’ to locate me). 

I texted them and apologized profusely. I feel so incredibly terrible. Their responses were completely understandable. They were glad I was okay, but frustrated that I never even texted them once until later at night. One friend even said that it “feels like I don’t want to see them as much as they want to see me”. I totally did not know they were going to worry like that, or that I should have texted them right after my therapy. I was just focused on the fact that we had plans for the next day, and I could text them later that night. It’s like mind couldn’t even conceive that they might be worried about me *that* day. But since then, my mood has shifted so significantly. I haven’t been able to do anything since. I didn’t see any friends the next day, or the day after. I even missed camping with another friend on the weekend. I couldn’t do anything.

Today is day 5, and while I did go outside today, I basically dissociated the entire day. Too scared to read more texts, too scared and exhausted to respond to others. I feel so discombobulated. I feel like a failure. Like a bad friend. I’m so worried that I’ll keep hurting them like this and they’ll eventually stop reaching out. Two friends already had to set boundaries with me. They have their own shit going on and to worry about me making plans or not showing had been too much for them. 

I just feel so lost. I have read about setting boundaries or talking to others about my triggers, but I don’t know where to start or even how. How can I explain to my friends about the exhaustion, the overwhelming guilt and shame that freezes me from action? These girls have been in my life for 15 years plus. They are solid friends, but I feel like my insecurities make me so reactive to any mistake I make, or even *perceived* mistake and their hurt destroys me. It feels like one I get a little handle of my PTSD, my ADHD comes screaming in and blows up my life.

If anyone has any advice or experience about healthy communication with friends, I would appreciate any help. Right now, it feels like my friends are my life line (I know not healthy and I’m working on that in therapy), but I know they don’t want me to disappear either. I don’t know what to do.

NSFW for mentions of SA

i’ve been raped in every relationship i’ve had with a man, excluding the one i am with now. i was groomed online as a child, sexualised/catcalled as soon as i turned 11 (early bloomer) and have been coerced, manipulated, whined and forced into having sex (and being punished for not having sex) for as long as i can remember. 

needless to say, my sexual image of myself and my sexual functioning is severely damaged. my libido was fine with my current partner for the first months or so, but the last few months, as i have grown closer to him and my body has realised he is safe, my libido shut down. anytime he tries to initiate i freeze, followed by a spiral of self hatred, guilt and shame (why can’t i just do it? what’s wrong with me? i need to just do it. i’m broken. im disgusting. i need to get it done or else im a bad gf etc), followed by an intense feeling of needing to “fix it” to make him happy. 

if you’ve experienced something similar, how have you healed from it and gotten your libido back? i love sex and its straining my relationship with my boyfriend a bit that i am never in the mood. i WANT to be in the mood, but my body just doesn’t allow it.

Im not too sure of the bipolar disorder. I'm not sure if it's a bit of ADHD/autism just because before my PTSD events, I suspected ADHD or autism to explain my personality

1lsw8a8,EPS Movements in PTSD?,"Two months ago or so, I was in a really bad state. During that time I’d begun having extremely repetitive, involuntary movements in my face and neck, and my airway and diaphragm would start spasming (specifically airway would close while I involuntarily breathe in). I may have had a slight neck twitch in the past every now and then if I was stressed, but when these ones started happening it’s like they start and I can’t stop them for hours. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water decreases the intensity but doesn’t stop them and if I’m still experiencing a stressor they go back to the intensity I was feeling them before I drank water. My therapist is calling them “EPS movements” and told me to take note of when they start. I noticed they start when I experience an unexpected trigger, or if I’m exposed to a trigger for a prolonged amount of time. They also start when preceding a panic attack or after a panic attack. So she figures it’s induced by stress. I thought they’d go away once I was out of my crisis, but they’re still happening, just less frequently.

My panic attacks have also gotten more intense during that time period, and they’re still pretty bad when I get them. Before, my extremities would go numb which is expected when you’re hyperventilating. Now my arms lock across my chest and my head gets locked backwards. Everything locks up and I can’t move and I feel like a spectator trapped in my own body. I get tremors in my hands and arms during or even up to a few hours or a day after I’ve had an attack. I’ve recently been prescribed a rescue medication to prevent these from getting worse when they happen.

I don’t fully understand why this happens. I already felt like I lost control of my wellbeing when my mental health declined, I don’t want to lose control of my body too.

If anyone’s experienced these things, I’d really appreciate knowing if there’s anything you’ve done to slow these down or stop them when they’re happening.

1lsolgi,Child of substance abusers- how to get over my panic attacks as soon as someone intoxicated talks to me?,"Hello. I grew up with alcohol/amphetamine addicted dad, and a cannabis addicted/wino mom. I don’t wanna get into detail what went down, but let’s just say I am left with major emotional scars. I panic around alcohol and I stay as far away from it as possible. Anyone who drinks that I meet and feel like I might get close to I warn them about my trauma, and tell them to not contact me when drunk. It’s really varied on if people respect that, and I cannot live like this anymore.
For example, tonight a guy im talking to didn’t respond for a long time(I have warned him about my ptsd etc) and comes back leaving a drunk voice note. I get a panic attack and start crying and now I’m here. Please help, how do I get over my deep fear of substances?",1751762622.0,8,6,ptsd,ptsd
1lsmcta,"""You probably have ptsd"" said a friend to a guy who broke up with a girl he was for a month...","(Tw for r4pe mentions)

Not to invalidate his feelings, i know he feels bad. He was telling us about what happened with this girl, skip the next paragraph if you dont care about his story.

Basically he was flirting with two girls at first, but because one of them had a lot of personal problems, he decided to focus on the other💀, they went out for a week and started dating. He says everything was good. At uni, they were always like very VERY close, kissing during class and stuff, this went on for a whole month. She ghosted him for some days and after that she broke up with him, and went back with her ex. 

Now on the main issue.. he had gotten very attached during that month, lovebombing ig, and he was devastated after she went back with her ex. He described that he can't bear to see her on class, he feels awful and feels a pang in his chest when she walks past him. 

Again, not to invalidate his feelings but my brain lagged for a second after a friend said he probably has ptsd. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think you can get ptsd from a relationship that never had physical or sexual abuse, or a loooong history of manipulation and emotional abuse.

I myself was a victim of rape and manipulation during a relationship that lasted a year, it was a HELL.

I of course said yes. I live in a small bedsit/studio room. Tbh, I never speak about it. It's not pleasant but I am working and saving so only really have slept there the last 6 months. It is what it is. 

Anyway. Has anyone experienced a lot of relief at night with PTSD symptoms sleeping on a boat?

I'm really enjoying the experience. I immediately notice my sleeping has massively improved. Even my movement as I have to not rock too much. I'm very outdoorsy so the basic day to day isn't too waking.

One was when my neighbors thinking something was strange because I had a rental car and not my normal car in the drive way and sent the cops for a welfare check. 

The other time my work sent a welfare check even though I told them i would be out the week because I had the flu and couldn’t or wouldn’t be well enough until at least the following week to come into work. They first sent HR out to knock on my door and then they called a wellness check on me while the HR people were still at my house. 

Both of those traumatized me and caused a ptsd trigger. 

This morning randomly the police banged on several doors in the condo complex either because something was in the air or the area but I’m pretty sure it was the air and there knocking aka banging and opening the door to see them kicked off a panic attack and ptsd trigger scared the shit out of me even though it’s been several years since the previous situations occurred .

I’m not looking for advice I’m just looking to vent and commiserate with anyone who has had a similar experience.  It’s been about an hour ago and even still taking my rescue med that I’m still feeling there’s reaction and I didn’t even catch completely why they were here . It was either because someone was in the area or something was in the air. And it scared the shit out of me when I opened the door and saw the cop there. 

They only seemed to knock on a few doors near me which makes me think it was the air and not area. We’re a small complex and only have 48 units , facing a courtyard, so if it was someone in the area I would think they would have checked everyone because they had 3 cruisers here total which would have made quick work of checking on everyone if they needed to.

So for many years, my mom has been telling me to improve my appearance. So I try to dress in age appropriate attire. But she told me to improve more. 

1. She told me to diet, strictly. 
2. To use whitening products to remove scars
3. She also nitpick about everything. 
4. Told me my bosoms are saggy and unattractive to my husband. I am single. 

She told me if I don't, no man would want me. 

So in result, I have gastric. It's quite bad that the acid reflux caused me to cough out blood. Then my skin became extremely sensitive, it started to swell, dried, cracked and bleed. 

My mom told me to dress modestly elegantly. So I wear a loose dress. But my *assets* are prominent, she says I am showing them off. So I wear tee and pants, with cardigan, she says the cardigan is old fashion. 

She told me to exercise to lose weight, but don't forget to tend the garden and clean thr house. I cleaned the house she said I clean the house too often and it's disrupting her activities. I'm told to diet but she won't let me eat except small carbs and some eggs. But then complain the eggs keep running out because of me. But she told me build chest muscles because my bosoms are saggy. 

The last straw when she got angry at me for asking her if I do cough out blood. The reason I asked her was because she was the one said I could be imagining I cough blood. So I yelled at her. 

Then my older sister shared a video in family group chat about a sermon ""we should be good to parents even if they slander you"".

I told my mom I am already being extremely good to her, when she literally caused me to frequent hospital for 6 months!

1lrh5yq,Why do I not feel trauma despite experiencing groping?,"when I was about 12 a guy who I thought was my friend started groping me. I ignored it at first — then due to him being shorter and skinnier, kicked him off my bed to run downstairs to stay in my parents sight until he left.

I never told anyone other than my 2 closest friends about this. what confuses me is that when I told them I feel like they reacted a lot bigger than I did ? I don’t have a diagnosis for ptsd but do have a therapist who suspects it. I’m not really sure if this then even counts as SA but idk where or who else to ask without telling someone in real life. And to clarify, the suspicion for ptsd is also due to a fire and not this.

i am however extremely paranoid and cautious around men, and now have a hard time talking with them normally without extreme fear, although im pretty sure everyone who’s been through something like that would experience way worse? Another thing i noticed is when i switch my LED lights onto the colour they were when he did that i get an uneasy feeling as if he was in the room, still no real panic though. I could maybe compare it to being on a fair ride and hearing a weird noise while on it.

is this normal? I tried researching and havent found anyone else who feels the same. I’m scared to speak up because I’m afraid people will ask me things I don’t even remember or know or expect my reaction to it to be worse. I’m glad I didn’t have any strong affects from that outside of being unable to leave the house without someone with me due to fear of another person doing the same or worse (maybe because of the actual realisation of how fast it can happen?), but I don’t experience anything else. I’m also afraid to speak up because if my therapist just ignored it due to how I feel about it that would still feel kind of invalidating and I’m unsure how she’d react if I told her about it.

Also, this happened almost 2 years ago so I don’t think it’s like a shock or anything? I’m also autistic and have adhd + other mental health issues unrelated to this post incase that might influence my reaction to this.

i don’t like talking about it to people who experienced the same either. this is also due to the way I reacted.

maybe I reacted this way because I didn’t really see him as a threat, and didn’t really understand what he was doing? I didn’t like touch in general and I mainly saw it as annoying so him not stopping made me more mad than scared. i only got the fears of going outside after fully realizing and processing what happened after telling my friends.

im sorry that this sounds weird. English isn’t my first language so if anything seems unclear due to my grammar or the words i used, i will gladly elaborate. I might talk about this to a therapist when im an adult and my parents don’t have to take care of anything or even know about it. 

also to add: My parents are divorced and I live with my mother. this happened at my dads house who is a lot less strict and mean + way more understanding than her.

to those who read without replying i hope you have a juice day. stay safe, you can get through this <33",1751630960.0,4,7,ptsd,ptsd
1lrhojw,Need help with right treatment,"Hi everyone,

My friend is going through something which I think is related to PTSD and I'm reaching out to check the kind of treatment, he could go for.

His father passed away couple of years back and it all started since then. He was extremely depressed that he started blaming himself for his death. His dad died of corona. He was so worried that he started feeling like a bad son.

It's all normal for someone mourning, so we didn't take it seriously and were only consoling it.

Over a period of time, he started getting problems in life like how his dad used to.

His dad always had this thing that someone might be following him. My friend also started complaining like someone is tracking him online. They are monitoring all his activities and he started avoiding his family, friends. He almost started living like his dad away from family.

His dad wrote all his properties on his brother's name, and my friend also did the same.

I'm not able to add each and every instance. But it's almost like he is doing what his dad did and living the life like how he lived.

He is in complete denial and now, his feeling of someone following him, manipulating his thoughts and actions are truly worrisome. 

I recommended counseling, but he is not ready to take it. Is there any other treatment I can put him in to help him overcome this?",1751632564.0,3,6,ptsd,ptsd
1lrc7vz,\Reckless Disassociation (Trauma Fatigue),"There’s this thing I’ve been dealing with lately, often called trauma fatigue, but someone once described it better to me as *reckless disassociation* — that moment when you blank out and stop giving a fuck. About anything. About the consequences. About the triggers. About how it’s going to wreck your body or crack your mind open again. You’re just *done*.

It’s not a moment of peace. It’s the kind of calm that comes from being utterly depleted. The kind of numbness that’s earned, not chosen — after weeks or months of hypervigilance, after noticing how your emotional reactions to even simple conversations feel *off*, *wrong*, *not you*. And by then, you're just running on fumes and adrenaline in the way junkies do when they’re spiraling. Except your drug is survival.

There’s no clear starting point, no dramatic switch — it’s a slow, relentless drip. Drip. Drip. Drip. Until you’re bone-tired and your body’s just as fed up as your mind. So you hit that point: devil-may-care. Give in to the bad impulses. Let the intrusive thoughts speak. You don’t just not care — you *can’t* care. You’re tapped out. You couldn’t find a single fuck to give, not even two.

I’ve talked to my psychologist about this more times than I can count. And right now, there’s no breakthrough for me. No fresh path toward healing. Because my progress has been hijacked by a legal process that’s dragged on for two and a half years. Every evaluation, every assessment, is another cut on top of barely healed wounds. It’s this cycle of re-explaining the pain, the trauma, the damage — over and over again. Each retelling strips away another layer until I’m just raw. And lately? I just don’t care anymore.

But not caring like this isn’t peace. It’s not apathy, either. It’s something deeper — nihilism, maybe. A dangerous edge where my emotional state is just: “I don’t care.” I don’t care about my case. About my injuries. About progress or setbacks. About *me*. For nearly a month straight, I just didn’t give a shit about *anything*. I just wanted to feel *free*.

And in a twisted way, it *was* freeing. Until the crash. Because the moment reality decides your brain’s little vacation is over, you’re not gently let back down. You *smash* back into the truth of your life like a goddamn train wreck. And you wonder why the hell you can’t stay blissfully ignorant of your own mind. You start to understand why lobotomies ever sounded like a good idea.

I’m not here to promise hope. I’m not even sure it gets better. This space — this state — this blank-eyed, reckless drift — it’s the apex of something terrifying. It’s where the most weary of us start to slip into addiction, mania, violence, alcoholism. It’s where your brain’s defenses just *walk out*, and leave you to fill the void with *something*, *anything*, *whatever* might drown out the noise.

It’s dangerous here.

And I still fall back into it. Some days. Some weeks. I just needed to get this out of my chest and into the air. If you’ve felt this too — I see you.

Thanks for listening.",1751612175.0,4,3,ptsd,ptsd
1lrcg62,Seeking advice: how to survive exposure to trauma triggers,"Well, I have no choice. My degree program (nursing) requires me to take a mental health class and unfortunately my trauma surrounds mental health system. I won’t get into the details because I don’t want to trigger anyone and that’s not why I’m posting. I am posting because even sort of thinking about the content I am going to cover in a month is giving me PTSD type nightmares and sleepless nights. I have previously tried to do a form of therapy similar to EMDR called accelerated resolution therapy that went SO BADLY, I felt so horrible after it! So I don’t really want to do EMDR. Is there any way I can survive this class without getting such bad nightmares? Thanks in advance. God bless ♥️ ",1751613053.0,3,2,ptsd,ptsd

1lrdjvp,Small triggers,"I wanted to see other people’s experiences of small triggers they gained after their traumas. I mean in a sense of like, after your trauma, what is something that made you more cautious of? For me, it would be doors. I always feel anxiety when I hear a door opening or I listen very closely to listen to footsteps and doorknobs moving. I use to hide when I heard a door opening but I no longer do, so I wanted to know if anyone else has something specific that they want to share? ",1751617505.0,2,2,ptsd,ptsd
