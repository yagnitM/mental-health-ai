cz6nfd,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1567525791.0,1782,248,SuicideWatch,suicide
pl9suy,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1631232110.0,716,43,SuicideWatch,suicide

Wars are encouraged and celebrated instead of being looked at with disgust. Genocides are cheered for by those who hate each other. Those in excess continue to horde and never extend an olive branch to those in need, often actively making decisions to make their suffering and sorrow worse. Im tired. It seems like the human model is to make each other suffer and to feel nothing about it, to watch people's lives and happiness be trampled without so much as a twinge of feeling.

1mqa50f,There's no point in living if I'm an ugly woman,"I'm tired, tired of waking up every day, looking in the mirror and having to see how ugly my face is, I'm tired of all the pretty women I know doing well in life and having good opportunities just because they're pretty, I'm tired of people not treating me well, of not being able to feel the right to fall in love with someone because I feel like it would be harassment, I don't know why life sent me to a superficial world being ugly. 

I have tried all the therapy possible, I have been hospitalized 5 times in mental hospitals, I have been with thousands of psychologists and psychiatrists but I just came to the point of recognizing that ugliness has no cure or treatment.

And to be honest, I'm not willing to put up with it any longer.

1mqff5a,Something in my bones is telling me its time.,"Just to be upfront: I know what the typical comments are going to say. I don't want to be talked out of it, I just want someone to talk to. 

I've struggled with suicidal ideation since I was a teenager (29 now). But for the last year or so, I have had this deep gutted feeling that my life truly cannot continue for much longer. The feeling is different, like it's urgent. 

I don't have an ounce of fight left in me. I am beyond mentally exhausted. The amount of pain, anxiety, heartbreak, stress, and constant feeling of fighting for my life that I have experienced the last few years has been far greater than what I can handle. There's no hope for my future, there is nothing here for me. I am so fucked up in the head that it's too far gone to ever get better. The world would be better off if I wasn't here and there's absolutely nothing that can be said to change my mind. I know what I am and where I stand, and with that, I need to not exist anymore. 

I'm sure that my mind is made up, and that this is really my only way out of the cycle of pain that is my life. But its not exactly something I can just talk to my husband or family about, and talking about the way I'm feeling with someone who understands is something I think I really need. I honestly don't know, maybe I need to just do this alone. I guess just voicing my feelings sounds kind of nice.

1mqlpgt,i’m going to kill myself Friday night.,"i keep telling myself it would be better for everyone if I wasn’t here. like, I’m just this shadow hanging over them, making everything heavier. if I left, they could breathe again. my mom could stop living in constant worry if her daughter’s okay. my friends wouldn’t have to keep asking if I’m okay when they already know I’m not. It almost feels logical, like taking myself out of the equation would finally give them peace.

it’s like the thought is getting heavier, pulling me in, and I’m tired of trying to fight it. I picture the quiet after, no more pretending, no more feeling like I’m taking up space I don’t deserve. I keep seeing my mom’s face in my head though, her eyes red, her voice breaking. my friends sitting there with that look, the one people get when they don’t know what to say. part of me wonders if I’m about to wreck them for life, another part says they’ll be fine, they’ll heal, people always do.

staying alive shouldn’t feel like an obligation. I want to do this. I think about it every day. if I just went through with it, everything would finally stop. no more nights lying awake, no more dragging myself through mornings I don’t want. I can already picture the silence, the stillness. I know my mom would break, my friends would hurt, but part of me doesn’t care anymore. or maybe I care, but not enough to keep living like this.

My mom said it was partly my fault I got molested and my sister said that it was my fault we were in foster care so long and if it hadn’t been for me we would’ve been released to my mother sooner. My sister said that because I lied, so it kinda makes sense but the thing my mom said I just don’t get how she could blame me.

I also feel like I’m out of place with my family, like I don’t fit in with them or they don’t want me there.!I’ve often been picked on or insulted or made fun of even when they think I can’t hear. I’ve also been blamed for things other people did, like growing up when my father threw a lamp on the ground my sister said “look at what you did” and often when my brother said or did something rude or bad I would be blamed for it.

I feel like they hate me and don’t want me here and wish I had never been here. I’ve also been suicidal and depressed for five or six years now, and I’m just tired of it.

My family doesn’t give me a choice in my life, like going to college, when to go to college, getting a license, and I don’t really want to go to an in person college when I transfer but my sister says I have to and it’s not a discussion. It makes me wanna die. I don’t think I want to do it. Maybe it’s because of my lack of social skills or the fact that I’m not sure what degree I even want or if I really wanna transfer. I’m just kind of doing it because I feel like I have to.

I'm 19m, have had depressive periods for most of my teenage life and now for the last 4 months it's been worse than ever. Every day I think of killing myself, I fantasize about giving away all my savings and finding a tall bridge, and yet I don't have a reason.

I know that suicidal thoughts are inherently irrational in a lot of cases, but I genuinely have a great life- money in the bank, loving, supportive parents, good friends, and yet I just feel- empty, like there's no point to my existence.

I think about my future and I see nothing but 50 more years of wage slavery, followed by 10 years of retirement when I'm too old to make the most of my life. I feel trapped, and there's no way out. I don't necessarily want to die, but I for sure don't want to keep on living.

Eventually, all relationships have to go through a phase, and I’d like to find someone who wouldn’t leave me when it feels like too much but work with me through the dark times.

1mqhjdj,Suicidal due to job searching struggle,"This is definitely not the worst situation in the world, but it’s pretty tough to be going through this non-stop for the past couple of years. 

Basically, I just graduated law school and I don’t have a job lined up. I went to a highly-ranked school where like 60% of the students go onto get their first job paying $225k/year. The other 40% either didn’t want those sort of jobs and ended up at other places that they find more fulfilling, interesting, etc. And then among a much, much smaller portion of that group are the people who are unemployed after law school. Unfortunately, that’s me. 

I wasn’t necessarily some superstar in law school, but I know for a fact that I was decent enough to not have ended up in this position. My GPA was pretty average, but I also did lots of competitions, clubs, journals and interned during the school year. I networked a ton (which was ultimately the biggest waste of time in the world) and had applied to hundreds of jobs throughout school. When I was interviewed, people seemed to like me well enough. I did tons of mock interviews as well to sharpen my skills and had only ever received positive feedback. In my second year alone, I’d sent out over 1000 applications. Despite all of my hard work, I don’t have a job lined up. 

I constantly feel like shit over this. Up until this point, I was always viewed by those close to me as this successful go-getter who excelled academically and had his priorities straight. Nobody in my life knows about this struggle either. I want so badly to keep up this appearance, but it’s only a matter of time until people realize that I’m a failure. 

I started taking antidepressants during my last year of law school, although I wish I’d started much sooner. However, I have days where I just spiral into these intense bouts of depression and suicidal ideation. 

I don’t really have any friends from law school since I felt so ashamed of my lack of career prospects that I just shut everyone out and avoided hanging out with people entirely. I didn’t go to any events and didn’t even go to my own graduation. 

I’m just venting at this point but this shit sucks so much and I hate how much of an impact it’s had on my life. It started my second semester of law school and has only gotten worse.

1mqgzn9,I don’t know how much longer I can do this,"I’m a graduate student, working towards getting my degree. I should be happy because it’s what I want to do. But I just feel terrible. Like I’ve always been suicidal ever since I was a kid, I would walk around singing at a grocery store about how I want to die. But like it’s gotten continually worse. 

My first major depressive episode, as psychiatrists would call it, was in highschool and my first attempt was around the same time. It feels like life has cursed me. Like I grew up in a broken home where my mom neglected me and my dad beat us and generally no one gave a shit about me. So I spent most of my life trying to give people the happiness I never had. But in the end I was just a tool used by other people. I initially intended to kill myself at the end of highschool but I thought I’d give college a shot, hanging on to hope.

But there is no hope. Every time I drag myself through the mud and stand back up, life seems to kick me back down. And while I’m on the ground it just keeps kicking. My second suicide attempt was during Covid, all my friends had abandoned me and I felt like a terrible person. A long-time friend confessed her love to me and I felt nothing for her. Like I’m just some non-human robot incapable of affection.

My most recent attempt was when I thought I wasn’t going to get into grad school. The more I think about it the more I realize maybe living wasn’t meant for me. Everyone will say just hold onto hope, but that’s nothing more than a lie told by those who have something. I have nothing, no friends, no family, no connections, no one to reach out to. And no matter what drugs or therapy I try nothing seems to work.

It’s just so hopeless. Recently I figured out my colleague crush was having sex in the ‘office’. She’ll always hide this guy that comes after hours and make slight moans in the other room. I’ve been addicted to masturbation for the longest time but I know I just crave dopamine, I crave something, to feel something. But along with my crush I just can’t bare to interact with people anymore. They’re so far away from me. 

I’m just so sad, and I’ve always been sad and I don’t know if it’s ever going to get better. If I can ever get better. Will it ever stop? Yet I keep waiting for some magical solution, I guess there’s still hope after all, but it never comes and I know it will never come. I can go to the gym, work non-stop to avoid it, find hobbies in videos games, hop on dating apps to mitigate the pain, go to therapy, try a new prescription. But it never stops. It only gets worse. How do I go on? How do I crawl out of this hole?

I’m too weak to kill myself, feel too bad. So am I just forced to live until death finally lets me go? But I’m so young, do I really have another 60 years of this? Sorry if this was long. Just a vent post I needed since I can’t talk to anyone.",1755214274.0,3,0,SuicideWatch,suicide

1mqnsoj,I fucked up horribly. I want to die.,"Gonna keep this brief. Can provide specific details later if I'm around.

I recently turned 25. Felt like a hollow husk since the age of 15.

Tried a bunch of things in recent years such as playing football (AFL), volunteering as an SES member, starting my career in accounting (Started Bookkeeper job last July after finishing TAFE).

It felt like no matter what I did - the empty void inside me was still prevalent. 

I also recently fucked up horribly and can't live with the guilt.

Back in March, I joined a growing Dandadan community and felt like I truly belonged for the first time in my life. I was able to find this community after the manga went on a month long hiatus. It was the best community I had ever been in. Overwhelming amount of positivity plus there's something for everyone! Art, games, tv shows, anime. 

I met someone special in that community when I first joined and she introduced me to my 2 closest friends at that time. Spending time with those 3 gave me genuine happiness for what felt like the first time in my life.

She and I fell into a situationship quickly after meeting as well. And after getting to know her more, I asked if she wanted to tone down our thing or stop. She asked to tone it down.

We weren't together nor do I think we would actually ever be an official thing.

I didn't listen. I continued to make comments.

In May, I flirted with another friend and member of that same community, which was reciprocated and went on for a few hours and she found out.

She told me that while we weren't together, she was emotionally vulnerable with me in a time of healing and made her feel like a toy. She never spoke to me since.

My mental health spiralled down each passing day until the guilt becane too overwhelming. I left that community without saying a word and fell out of touch with the two friends she introduced me to.

Those 3 meant so much to me. They were my muse and I loved each of them dearly. Without them, I again feel like that hollow husk.

Except the feeling is much worse than before. I had what I wanted all my life, genuine friends. But I fucked it up and lost it.

I've been attending therapy for over a month now and she has been wonderful - but the guilt, regret and shame of what I did still haunts me.

I did impulsively attempt to take my life once before when I was 15. The deep scars along my inner thighs serve as a reminder. I never attempted again until last night.

I tested my low suspension setup in my bedroom and lasted about 15 seconds before I stopped. Felt like my head was gonna pop, but I could still breath during it.

I've done alot of research into different methods of suicide and would've ideally wanted to do the exit bag method. Unfortunately in Australia, there's no way to bulk buy Nitrogen/Argon gas without suspicion. 

When I learnt about low suspension, I read that you can position the rope to only block the bloodflow to the brain to induce unconsciousness, which is what I tried to do last night.

Sadly I couldn't get it right but I'm gonna try again tomorrow night.

Again, this is all VERY brief.

I hate myself for what I did.

I hate that I betrayed the trust of the community and to my 3 closest friends.

I hate that after all my life when I finally had what I wanted, I fucked it up.

I believe many people in my shoes would not have this conclusion, however they just don’t- and will never - understand. That if I can’t dream I cant live. That I’ve failed, over and over again. I was given so many chances to prove myself since Year 9, and I could never do it. It was handed to me on a silver platter yet I slipped and it fell on the floor, crushed, spoiled, staring back at me in utter disgust. Perhaps, it is not that others do not understand me, but I simply do not make sense. My mind is fractured in so many ways, and just when I felt like the system, others, had finally seen me, I was rejected once more. This is the end of my life. And I feel it. I can dream of a future, but I realise now that I never saw myself. That was not me. There is a version of me in my mind which I have come to confront is not real and never has been. I’ve become delusional, and I truly believed that I was not a dreamer but a doer. It was a lie. But what hurts the most is to see that my one passion outside of this deluded dream, my writing, literature, to be completely dismantled, destroyed, tossed away and regarded as a mess has completely broken my heart and I know I will never recover. I am fucking shit at English. English. English. English. I was delusional. To think the one thing I believed no one could take from me was never mine. It was a fantasy, that conveniently was encouraged for the past two years of my life, that I believed I was something outside of my mind. Others, in my position would grab the possible alternative degrees and move on. They’d be upset but they’d believe everything works out in the end. But I know myself more than anything. I cant bring up my SATS without shame. I was 11. I will never forgive myself for my GCSES. I will never forgive myself for English. For being handed it all, the dream so close to attainment. I could smell it. Taste it. Fuck I was so delusional I even allowed it to seep into reality in the form of hope. I cannot live with it. I will be, and am, miserable. It’s not even been 24 hours. In years? No. I cannot handle it. My heart has always been weak. So I will die before September arrives. Because all I ever was, was nothing. Everything I was, was a dream. And without my mind to fumble and curate fantasies, as I’ve been forced into a reality that clashes with everything I’ve ever dreamed of myself with, I am a bag of blood and organs. I’d rather make a sacrifice for a cause. That way, I will not dream again, and I will not be forced to live a lifetime of a nightmare. Perhaps I will be something, or perhaps I will, inevitably as I am, be nothing. This life was a life of nothing. I am sorry God, for the futility of such a beautifully horrifying creation of humanity. For living such a lifetime of delusion, that nothing on this earth could ever possibly glance at my writing, art, physical self, mental self, and feel anything but pure disgust. ",1755232608.0,1,0,SuicideWatch,suicide

I decided back then that I was gonna just get it over with. I had a plan. I wanted it to be peaceful. I have a shotgun so I could have just painted the walls red and called it a day, but I didn’t want my family to have to see that. I decided on nitrous asphyxiation. Just rig up a small nitrous bottle to a breathing mask, put it on, and go to sleep. Within a few minutes it’s over. Only problem was I didn’t have any money. So I got a job working on cars and it actually gave me a new sense of purpose because I was really good at my job. I ended up getting a better job (so I thought) working on semi trucks and signed a contract with the company I work for which provided me with free training and expert level certifications as long as I stayed at the job for 3 years. That was 2 years ago. And in those two years, prices have continued to rise uncontrollably and my pay has not kept up. I can’t afford even my basic necessities. I’ve applied to over 400 part time positions and can’t get a second job. I can’t make enough delivering food on DoorDash to cover the difference. If I can’t make rent and lose my home, I’m gonna find someone who will take good care of my cat and I’m gonna take whatever money I have and drive to somewhere quiet and peaceful, slam down some drinks, and find out what comes after this life because I don’t see any reason to keep going.

I've dealt with suicidal feelings since middle school, because I have a severe speech disability (a stutter) that makes it impossible for me to talk to other people no matter how much i try, AND because im a trans woman who grew up in a transphobic family and school and church and i've had basically zero support system during my transition because my stutter prevents me from finding one.

It might sound ridiculous that a stutter makes me feel so bad i don't want to be alive anymore, but it really is that bad. I go to work and people don't even talk to me because it's so severe I usually can't even say a simple ""good morning"" to them and nobody wants to casually talk to someone like that, much less be friends with someone like that. I'm a senior at college and I've made no friends, did zero networking, I basically just answered enough discussion posts to get all my credits. I'm 24 and I've never even gone on a date. The few times i do hang out with friends (aka the people i graduated from high school with that just kinda keep me around sometimes), all i can do is sit there and listen to them have fun chatting.

People usually assume my stutter is worse around strangers, but it's not, because it's the people I'm around more often not talking to me that remind me how lonely I am. This weekend is a mandatory staff training thing at work and it's making me so anxious and depressed I feel like I have to post here, which sounds so fucking stupid but it's true, the thought of walking in and having to find a seat somewhere surrounded by people who are so close to each other but a universe away from me is so debilitating.

I imagine my graduation a few months from now and I basically imagine the day my life ends. Because I'm gonna walk on that stage when my name is called and there's not going to be a single cheer or clap, because my family hates me for being trans and wishes i wasn't here almost as much as i do, and i didn't make a single friend here either.

1mq8sye,I can’t take it anymore.,"I’ve tried to kill myself over 60+ times. Why 60 or over? Because I try almost everyday and someone calls the police on me. Whether it be someone who lives with me or someone outside. 

I’ve tried drowning, getting run over by traffic, going under busses, tried to go over bridges, cliffs, jumping off a car, tried jumping off car parks, tried hanging myself by nooses, tried cutting deeply (I now  have huge scars), asphyxiation and overdosing.

Why drowning hasn’t worked? People spot me. Why not traffic? People pull me away. Why not cliffs and bridges? Same reason. Why not cuts? People spotted it. Why not overdosing? People saved me in time same as asphyxiation. Hanging has been the best when it comes to an actual suicide attempt, I’ve nearly died many times thanks to it. But UNFORTUNATELY FAIL.

Having someone helicopter you as an adult man, calling the police on you when you try to attempt and letting them throw you in a hospital is a horrible way to live. 
When I end up in mental institutions, other men fuck around with me in sexual way. I don’t hate it at all but I feel like I’m always been used by others. When I don’t end up ok wards, I stay in emergency apartments where the staff treat me like shit and their security staff tell me that I shouldn’t be a coward and just kill myself and that I don’t matter in life.

Some security also have punched me in the stomach and beaten me. I’ve also been slammed across the wall by another patient in the emergency apartment not that long ago. I requested not to get him in trouble by the police because I’m not a bad man but it still hurts.

I can’t stand to look at myself anymore in the mirror. I can’t stand it. I can’t take it, even the people in my life tell me I’m ugly, disgusting and horrible everyday. A lot of people encourage me to kill myself. The only person in my life who has truely hardly ever hurt me is my Father.

I’m a guy and I had a failed attempt before when I was in highschool, but I have my life in order now. I’m a 3.9 GPA student in my dream university with a girlfriend who loves me a lot with a big circle of close friends. 

But recently I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for no reason. And then I started feeling alone and sad during hangouts with friends even when we were laughing and making jokes it felt like I was faking it more or less. I almost even considered SH again?

None of these thoughts has affected my university or social relationships much so I don’t think its depression honestly. I only got concerned when I seriously started considering buying a rifle and popping my top off and then started tearing up while in the car with my friend like it just came out of left field while i was hanging out with my bff?? But the thoughts go away if I get distracted or start to focus on something (like studying). I honest to god don’t even have any reasons to be depressed/suicidal my life is at the highest point its been since I was born, so its confusing me on why this is happening?

1mqc9hj,Why live when you get no support from anybody?,"I feel like I get no support from my irls.

On the day that my little cousin died, I was in ruins, devastated.

Of course I called my (now ex) bsf of 15 years about what happened with my little just half an hour after I got the news about her death. This was July 30th.

I'm freaking out, screaming, crying, begging for my bsf for me to come over to her place. She told me that she had family and I was already hysterical so l didn't think rationally. I got mad, pressed her about it, but I was like ""ok fine that makes sense I guess"" I decided that maybe the day after. She kept sayinf that her little brother was going to sleepover and didn't know how long he would stay until the next day, which is why I said ""OK, I mean AFTER they leave""
And she didnt even consider planning with me??

Just said ""Sorry that one of your family members has passed away. I do offer my condolences.
But sorry that I also want to prioritize my family, who I only see maybe twice a year because I have a really weird family situation with my dad. Do I cancel the day they're supposed to come? [Little brother's name] will be so sad.
Do you think it's so cool for me to watch them cry on the way out the door because they have to stop after one visit? So no, I won’t cancel.""

But it wasn’t about her canceling. I tried to compromise, saying: hey, maybe you can prioritize me after your family has come over alright? Because what I meant was that I wanted to come over AFTER. She just keeps saying she doesn't know what comes after like her plans.
Girl.. if you already don't have anything planned
THEN MAYBE BE THERE FOR ME.
It wasn’t just about that, I was hurt because of the way she worded things and her tone. I don’t think people get what I mean whenever I talk about this. She GETS to see her younger siblings. I DON’T. I don’t like how she had to make it about herself. I feel hurt.

I couldn't take it when we called and I kept trying to get idk just a sliver of actual support and, I know l was wrong for this, but you have to understand that I wasn't thinking rationally because well idk my cousin just died and also this was like half an hour fresh.
I said ""You know what? Just fuck your life away (as in have sex)! Drink your life away! Party your life away! Have fun with your friends! Have fun with your family. But I meaj it when I say this, really, have fun with your family.""

l've resented her because she always talked about partying, but she did eventually stop when I told her to since well parties make me feel really left out because I was bullied and never included im anything. She always came to me cryinf about stuff and I would always be a shoulder for her to cry on. I stayed up for her even though I really wanted to sleep. | listened and comforted her. If she needed advice, I'd be there for her.
But when my basically little sister dies, she just can't even prioritize me at all and blocks me because her feelings got hurt as if my feelings aren't more hurt than her because my cousin literally died??? I didn’t ask for her to come to the funeral, I didn’t ask for her to drop all her plans. 

All I wanted was some support the day after her family leaves. That’s it.


I know I'm wrong for what I said, but just want people to look at the bigger picture.
I do feel a bit bad for what I said, I just wish she could support me. I wish she would be there for me. I kept reiterating that I needed to be with her the day AFTERRRR her family leaves. I’m hurt. She wasn’t even TRYING to plan at all. I spoke in the heat of the moment, lashed out, but honestly I was grieving and hurt and I didn’t think clearly. I’m just really fucking hurt, man. I feel like nobody supports me and constantly when I try to vent to someone I’m always told to consider how THEY feel and it’s never ever about me, never never never
I honestly want to kill myself I’m not even kidding. I’m exhausted from this.

My little cousin was my reason to live, the reason I’m still alive, but she’s gone. She’s the only semblance of purity and innocence I have left. I have nothing else, no other form of innocence left.
I feel so much rage at the world, trying to vent about this only to have people booing at me and being fucking hostile and rude. Maybe I should’ve given more context as well. Still.

Shit keeps happening to me one after another, one traumatic event after another. You think I want to live like this? You think I’m in the mood to go through this? I don’t want to live. I’m so tired.",1755203384.0,4,1,SuicideWatch,suicide

Im beginning to realize I dont have it in me to make it through another round of seasonal depression this winter on top of all the loss i've gone through already in life

I recently got in an argument with parents I just wanted to do family therapy together and ive been trying to explain to them how badly things have gotten in our relationship but i feel like they dont understand the mortality of it all and how serious this is and im just having some type of sadness that will pass.

It’s been almost a decade and I still feel a draw to suicide, like it’s meant to happened, Maybe it is, im not sure, I never believed in destiny or fate none of that really means anything to me.

1mqggf9,Mental deterioration,"I am terribly unwell. I usually post on this subreddit regularly trying to get my thoughts out, but the past few days I seem to have lost the ability to articulate a coherent post. I tried to type one this morning and found myself typing a huge rambling post about nothing for nearly 45 minutes. I am going to try again to keep it shorter and to the point. 

I have lost my mind. Last year I was diagnosed bipolar. I was having insane religious delusions about God and Jesus. The decisions I made in this time completely ruined my life. I will never be able to rebuild. I am struggling to accept that I will likely never be happy again. I’ve had some issues with depression in the past, and I worked my ass off to build a life that I really loved. I had purpose and passion. I loved my job. I never dreaded going to sleep and never snoozed my alarm cause I loved what I did. I worked with my best friends. I lost the jobs and the friends. Nobody wants anything to do with me anymore. I’ve always been a bit troubled but people always liked me. I was a nice personable guy and I generally did well socially. For me it was a comeback story. I overcame some
Major setbacks and then I put myself in an even worse position than I ever was. I feel my mind cannot comprehend what has happened and where my life has ended up. 

I am severely suicidal. To rate my passive suicidal ideations I would say 10/10. I wish I was dead all day every day. I’ll be eating lunch with my dad and consistently thinking “I wish I was dead” periodically. I have a plan and a method that I believe will be quite reliable, but the thought of suicide terrifies me. I don’t realistically see myself going through with it anytime soon. I’m happy to have a method in case one day I get super impulsive and get over my fear, but I don’t see that happening. 

I have not abandoned my religion, however I don’t think it is healthy. When I pray I pray for two things. First I try to praise God and Jesus. I want them to know that I do not blame them or anybody other than myself for what has become of me. The second thing I pray for is death. This is the obsessive part. First I have begun to believe that praying does not make much difference in your life circumstances. Perhaps a healthier mind can get relief and find peace through prayer, but not mine. I beg God to take my life. The crazy part is I actually believe he will do it. Like I said I have come to be taught that prayer does not make much difference in our life circumstances, and everyone says that there is no way in Hell God will take my life simply through prayer. There are many people more righteous than I who are probably in a much worse situation who deserve it much more than I do. I continue to pray for it nearly constantly. It is definitely a symptom of mental illness because I know it achieves nothing yet I do it constantly. It’s the last thing I do at night and the first thing I do in the morning. I do it quite a bit throughout the day as well. 

I have been thinking a lot about death. I have no fear of being dead anymore. I am not sure what happens when we die, but whatever it is it will be better than this. I am sure many people have meaning in their lives and this experience on earth is important for them, but if are alive only for a time and we are dead for all eternity after, then what we do on this planet is infinitely smaller than the afterlife. I used to be afraid of being dead. Not anymore, but I am afraid of the process. I realize I am not making a whole lot of sense anymore. This post took me nearly 30
Minutes. I used to be a great writer and had no issue articulating my thoughts. It’s very tragic to watch myself deteriorate the way that I have. 

I used to be something man. I wasn’t perfect, but I had a good life. I was in the process of making something of myself. I had friends. I could’ve eventually gotten a girlfriend and gotten married and had kids and hung out with my family and friends and have bbq’s and birthday parties and beach trips and vacations. I feel like a lot of these things to wish I could have are not even that reasonable, but now such simple things are out of my grasp. I’m coming to terms with the fact that I will likely have to get a miserable job that barely pays me any money and I’ll just work and then go home and be a recluse. I pray to God I can find a job with some sort of insurance because as a mentally ill type 1 diabetic I’ll die without insurance. 

Oh well. I never got to live, and now I’m working on accepting that I never will. I am unwell and have been for coming up on a year now with no positive progress. In fact I have continuously gotten worse and worse. It is obvious when people interact with me that I have something wrong with me. I wasn’t always like this. ",1755212960.0,2,0,SuicideWatch,suicide

1mqkoqb,I Am Going to End My Life. Even Though I Don’t Want To.,"I use illegal drugs regularly. I am not proud of it but it’s what seems to work for me, keeps me out of my head and it just keeps me moving foward. Before the drugs I struggled with everything. I could never do literally anything with any kind of confidence and even worse I either had trouble finding and maintaining interest in anything, whether an activity or even people, nothing ever made me feel like it was something worth pursuing.  Even if I did garner some kind of interest in something, the lack of confidence and low self esteem buried any chance it had.  The drugs were the cure.

Fast foward through many years of trials and struggles. Issues with law enforcement and addiction. An arrest here and there but nothing I wasn’t able to bounce back from. Except now…
I work for a company that has a shoreline railroad that involves working on a locomotive moving railcars. Not all day everyday but when certain shops need a train car moved we do it. The Federal Rail Administration about a month or so ago suddenly has taken an interest in us and last week was given a notice for a random drug test.  Took one for the job 8 years ago but that was it.  Apparently the FRA is hounding them on getting up to par with their policies.  I think it’s bullshit what I do outside of work is none of their business.  On top of that t they only seem to be concerned with that. They haven’t brought up things like our switches being way off point, tracks are horrible like derail any day.  The idiot locomotive operator who is clueless and dangerous has no certificate or license nor the HS diploma/GED and neither does my boss.  I was nearly killed the other day when a chain snapped trying to open a rail car door or when I was riding grain car and it picked the switch and came of the track almost laid over on top of me.  No mention or concern of those things and I could name 100s of dangerous accidents waiting to happen or employees who are in wrong jobs.  So I got clean piss from friend and took test, temp checked out, nurse seals and I sign off and I am thinking I’m good.  Nope. 
Get home take shower and afterward I see StLukes UHN called me(testing place).  It’s like 8 pm so like 10 hours after I took piss test.  See a voicemail asking me to call them 1st thing in morning.  Fuck.  I’m fucked. 
I’m pretty sure it’s not going to be good and I just can’t go through another set back like this.  Things were in the up and up the last few years and I can see how it is all going to crash and I don’t want to rebuil my life again I just don’t. 

So I’m done. I’ll be up all night tonight getting completely blasted on the rest of my stash deciding how I want to do this.  I don’t know if I want it to look like a suicide I’m thinking about driving into a wall or off a bridge but I don’t want to hurt anyone. I guess it’s not important how it looks I just need to get it done.  I feel bad for my parents and my brother and my niece I don’t want to do this but I can’t go through the starting over again and I hope they will understand.  I love them. 

At least I’m single and no kids, I still feel like a piece of shit.  Don’t do drugs kids.  Seriously, good luck everyone.  I hope maybe I will see a few people in the afterlife if it’s there. That’s all I can hope for I guess",1755224064.0,1,5,SuicideWatch,suicide

1mqeh8z,"Hey, bros. I need some help with some suicidal thoughts rn","idk what to say rn, but I just wanna have some good reason to keep going other than the pain of doing it, and the pain of failing to do it. hi, everyone who cares enough to read this. my name is Christian, and I am 15. I’m not going to say where I live, or my last name for personal reasons, but I seriously can’t find a good reason to live, and I wanna find out if there’s anything good coming my way, or if it‘s already as good as over. here’s my reason for suicide. First, my mom knows I’m suicidal, but hasn’t ever cared to act like she wants me to stay alive, and she basically seems like she’s cool with it. Don’t argue that fact, because I know it for sure. It takes a single google to find out how not to treat a suicidal person, and she has done nothing of the sort. one day when I was suicidal, she chased me around the house after I tried to go downstairs, and punch a punching bag to get out my anger. She called my dad, and made me talk with him, and so I hung up on him, and then went upstairs to my room, and she unlocked the door to make me talk with him again. He got angry that I hung up on him, and then we talked for a bit, while my mom just sat there, not even seeming like she knew what she did, so I mouthed to her that she was the worst, and that she knows I hate my dad, and that he won’t comfort me, and she looked super upset, and almost like she was disgusted by me acting that way, and after the cal, ended I forced her to leave my room, and then cried for at least 30 minutes, and that’s the end of all relevant parts of that story. For extra info, my dad has been suicidal, and he’s shot a gun in our house, broken down the door to both the house, and my mom’s room, and he’s an all around terrible person, and he still didn’t understand me, and for my whole life my sister Ava has been his favorite, no matter what, if she touches me, it goes Ava, don’t touch him, Christian don’t touch her. And like, okay, makes sense, just in case I hit her too, but if I was to touch her, she acts like I hit her, and theennnnnnn it goes “Ava, don’t antagonize him, Christian don’t you ever touch her again, or I will knock you’re head off you’re neck.” And that’s like… okay, wtf? Clear favoritism. It’s been like that my whole life. I need to hear a good reason not to commit suicide, or I might just do it, bro.

I was raped shortly after leaving HS. I'm permanently physically disabled to where finding fulltime work enough to cover my medical expenses after I'm 26 is like climbing Everest... while physically disabled. Every time my illness acts up it reminds me of how I'll never be as healthy as a normal person.

I have constant anxiety during the day and panic attacks too. And tbh it's now progressed to hallucinating my phone is talking to me in a scary deep voice.

I'm not in therapy currently because my past few failed me so bad (one of them comparing my extremely traumatic surgery experience to a vasectomy). I'm self harming again after 3 years, when it sent me to the hospital.

To be honest I'm on the verge of committing suicide. All I need is a date. Every day, minute, hour is bought, delaying what I feel is inevitable.

Plus the emotional neglect from my childhood makes it very hard to determine when I should seek such help. And my parents already being emotionally/mentally strung out does not help whatsoever.

But life is so fucking difficult, there's no support systems around me, I don't trust anyone, I've been on my own for so long trying to survive, and I've recently unearthed a lot of violent childhood trauma including possible csa and I feel like all I see, when I look in the mirror, is layers upon layers of ugliness and all the horrible parts of everyone who's abused me injected into me and left there to rot. 

That's all I see. A shell with a rotting inside. I hate the core of who I am and it poisons the way I see the outside and so I start to hate all of it. 
I stick around because there are people who I can't leave yet, because they've gone through their own share of trauma and me leaving might destabilised them reaching a place that's stable and comfortable in life. 
So truthfully I am just hanging on until they're safe and then I can go, and try and be here for them as long as I can whilst I am. But every day I wake up and I want to die. Every issue I'm faced with bc of my identity, my life and my health just rots me even more, and I can't see a way out.

My mental health has now improved a great deal, but try as I might I cannot convince my wife that I was not responsible for my actions.

Like what do I do when my whole life and entire being at every single moment I’m stuck in ‘the ocean’. I’m so tired of doing all the things so I can “get through this moment” but the moment doesn’t end!!! I genuinely don’t know how else to explain it and how many more time I can try to do so. Like it’s not a bad feeling that will pass in 20 mins, I’m not suicidal because of an impulsive and emotional moment that will pass. Im actively wanting to die, but it’s not some impulsive moment I that will settle. It’s my entire existence and if I was to set a timer and breath, or journal, etc. for however long until the moment passes’ I would be stuck sitting here for every single minute, hour, day, week, month, year until my body physically shuts down. And I practically am! Yes I give in sometimes and do the bad coping skills but it’s because I literally just sit here and waste away doing nothing. Like I’d love to do that because maybe then the moment like myself would have what a week or two and we’d both be gone. But unfortunately I’m unable to do that. Like every second I’m doing some coping skill or distraction, and then because I’m alive I have to do things go to work, eat, exist for other people, and even then I’m still things like breathing techniques and stuff but there comes a point where you can’t fucking take it. So yes in those moments I binge eat, or in the past have self-harmed, used drugs, drink, so that I could continue to COPE with existing. But I don’t understand how you keep this shit up. Like I’ve been doing this for 20+ years and I can’t fucking take it but ending it ‘is wrong’ and even if that weren’t the case I don’t know how to escape! If I had an actual way out I would, but every attempt by my own hand or others has been so unsuccessful that I genuinely feel like I’m trapped here and this is my own fucking hell.

I give up. I have given up long ago. I don't know what is wrong with me anymore. I am at my breaking point again, maybe have been since the last time, just sedated on pills.

I don't ask for help, nor tips, or ways out. I'd say I'm not dumb, I know my way around it. I know how ""fine"" should be and could fool myself into it until I decided to die, and I also know, with enough determination, suicide is almost guaranteed if I do as I think I should.

It's something I've known since I was little. It is me who is going to decide when and how to go, I just still have some affairs to take care of and physical pain is always a concern.

I am diagnosed with dysthymia, I've had it for the better part of my life now. I think some traits of mine also match with a melancholic brain structure. But my life on paper is ""good"", my parents love me, I go to a nice school where I have ""friends"", and I have food and shelter.

I just mentally can't be okay, nor want to. 2 days ago I ended up on the ER because I cut my wrist until I felt electrical shocks and as if it were about to ""explode"". It ended up being nothing much. Now I'm on suicide watch again and my therapist who I love is asking me if therapy with him is any good at all. I'm going to see my psychiatrist today and open up, just to end up in the mental hospital again.

I don't even know if it bothers me anymore. I kind of want it, even. It doesn't help, there is no help for me. I guess I'll wait another 3 years until this happens again, while im sedated and automatized in weirdly named chemicals. It'll happen over and over, until I decide to end it.

Even with the pills, I act okay on the outside but I feel like a machine, and I'm conscious of whatever is being hidden in them. I still want to die. I still hate it all. When I don't take them, this is what happens. This all happened these days because I stopped taking them without anyone knowing. Quite easy, lemme tell ya. I know my way around the acts. I was tired of being a robot. So tired, that I became a zombie once more.

I am sick of this. I will end up in the mental hospital, and once I come out it'll be the same. It's always the same for tiny ol' me. My childhood has been rough and my teenage years are not much better. 

I feel helpless and stuck, time goes by slowly and I wait for the next day, only for nothing to happen ever. I have not a strand of hair that knows ambition, not a cell that can perform any hobbies, and no passion about anything. Whatever quiets down my head and whatever brings me physical pleasure I dig. I eat, I sleep and I smoke. I listen to music.

1mqd8nr,I regret not ending myself years ago,"I don’t have an official diagnosis, since i truly distrust and somewhat despise therapists/anyone working in MH as a specialist as a whole due to a really unpleasant experience back in early middle school. Long story short, my school psychologist locked me and a couple of other girls up in a room and didn’t let us out until all of us have shared our deepest troubles with others (this wasn’t initiated by school based on some psych evaluation, it was a random encounter). Ever since then I somewhat get uncomfortable in presence of a psych specialist, which is why I don’t seek professional help, although I know it’s probably dumb. However, despite that, I have a really high suspicion that I might be depressed since I was 13 (I’m 20 as of now). I genuinely don’t know how to express what I’ve been feeling for the past 7 years, so I’ll try to explain it in bits. I was brought up in a household where we don’t verbally express our love towards each other, we rarely do so, every single time my parents hug and tell me that they love me, although quite rare, I try to get away asap so I won’t break down crying in front of them (not because I dislike them, but because I love them that much and simply can’t express my emotions well). I’m not sure why, but I grew up thinking I can’t express much emotions, especially those of sadness or especially tears, which is weird because all of my other siblings(I’m 2nd oldest)  have no trouble at all with expressing any emotions nor are they self isolating like I am since I was 13. I’ve just sitting in my room most of the time, skipping family dinners because I feel like they’re having a much happier time without me, the mood breaker there. I was doing SH in the timeframe of me being 13 till about 16-17 y.o., going through the trouble of meticulously hiding it even during hot 45°C summers. In the same timeframe, I was thinking of attempting on a regular occasion, actually ended up trying 2 times. Both unsuccessful, fortunately or not. However, the second attempt is something I feel guilty for. I still remember the look on my dad’s face, someone who never looks dumbfounded or visibly sad, when he was pulling me away from the knife. Jokingly sounding remembrance of my mom of that situation with obvious hurting in her voice.

Hi, I’m 21F from India. I’ve been carrying this pain since I was a child and I feel like I’m reaching my limit. I’m posting here because I don’t know where else to turn.

I was sexually abused by my brother for 10 years, mostly while I was asleep. When I finally spoke up, my parents blamed me. My father insulted me with abusive language. My mother never stood up for me. I’ve been trying to heal, but the emotional damage has been enormous.

I also have severe migraines every single day, nightmares about dying, and constant stress. I’ve tried to study, to live, to breathe, but it feels impossible. I even went to the police, but they refused to register my case because it is “family.”

Every day feels like a battle I cannot win. I cry daily, I feel completely alone, and I just want peace from all of this pain. I wanted to live a beautiful life and do so much, but I feel robbed of that chance.

I’m not looking for pity, I just need someone to hear me and maybe tell me how they found a way to keep going when everything felt hopeless. How do you survive when the people who should protect you are the ones who hurt you? How do you stop feeling like the only escape is to stop existing?

If you have been through something similar, please tell me what helped you. Even if it is a small step. I don’t want to feel like this forever.",1755161806.0,7,9,SuicideWatch,suicide

I do laugh watching reels, crazy videos and funny memes but its temporary and the depression continues. Some nights are sleepless while the other nights goes 12-14 hours sleep for me. There’s a clear irregular pattern. I am not able to focus on things. I run away from important shit in my life. I run away from responsibilities. I run away from taking important decisions. I am not able to put pressure or stress on my head. There’s a constant regret, guilt or disappointment on myself. I want everything in this world yet I dont wanna work for it. I am trying my best to love money and work more but all of it is going in opposite directions. There’s no motivation in me to go earn money. I dont know why I dont love wealth which is so useful for a peaceful life. I am finding it hard to have a reason for this life!? 

I have a post grad degree and I know there’s plenty of good jobs out there but still I am not following the pathway to it even after knowing about it. I can have an awesome future but im not working for it. I am stuck with my part time job which is paying my bills and instalments. Im not able to get out of it. 

While writing all this millions of thoughts crossing my mind and I am just typing whatever crosses my mind first. 

I am a failure when it comes to love. I have always chased people who weren’t interested in me or not even my friends to show their love to me. I never gave a chance to girls around me looking for a better option. I have been in few relationships but nothing worked. There was one girl I truly loved and did everything i could but she was never interested in me. Out of desperation, I have definitely done some stupid shit which spoiled everything we had. Now the thing is, I have a person in my thoughts who has similar attributes, personality, traits, face, body, odor but its not her. I see her in my dreams. I see her while driving. I see her while doing my everyday tasks. She doesn’t exist in reality. She’s a 11/10 perfect girl for me which is created by my mind and has everything i wished for. The primary source for this girl of my dreams is the one who i loved but this is not her. Someone else who I haven’t met in my life ever or simply she doesn’t exist on this planet. My head is totally fucked and for this reason I am not able to love anybody else. 

I am a loner on the journey to become an introvert. My female interaction is zero in my life and that makes me think I dont even have a partner to have a reason for this life. If money is the answer so that would mean a girl is coming into my life for money reasons and not to love me!? I do understand that its vital to have wealth which can give you a comfortable life. At the same time, what if one day you lose it all and she decides to go away because now you cant take care of her? I am not the man who would tell her to go out and earn because one day she might make me count her contribution she has made financially. 

Its a whole fucked up world guys. I was better as a kid. The whole world is fucking running towards something without a reason and end goal. No one knows why they are running.

I have nothing going for me bc instead of going to college when I was younger, I stupidly was more focused on self medicating on drugs and alcohol to deal with SA and the bad choices I made from being traumatized from it and now im stuck in a dead end accounting position.

And thing is, i barely have any friends left. I talk to nobody other than him. I don't have anybody else. So during these ""alone days"", where we are apart, i just fucking rot in my room. It sucks, it really does, and i hate it.

I watched my grandpa take his final breath ten years ago when I was just 17 years old. After my phone called me to tell me what was going on I went down stairs to my ex girlfriend's apartment(she lives in the unit directly below me) and instantly broke down. I fell to my hands and knees and just started crying. I just needed her to hold me in her arms but she doesn't want to do that anymore. I started telling her how I don't care if it's bad or good that I will do anything to be with her again. She didn't like that. I just felt like a burden to her.

1mpu62w,Story that's worth your time,"Hi everyone, I am a Canadian high schooler with parents moved to the prefecture of Osaka, Japan.

There was this girl in my class who always used to sit next to me in every class, she never spoke to me and was always doing nature based drawings during class. Right before class ended  I complimented a butterfly drawing she had made, she smiled then went home. Every day after that I always complimented her drawings right before she went home but never said anything back, only smiled. However, about a week after receiving compliments about her drawings she finally spoke to me as soon as the class started asking about flowers I like, animals and so on... I then said I liked the cherry blossoms because of their bright pink that always catches my eye. She took my hand and drew a beautiful cherry blossom on it, after seeing it I thanked her and said it was beautiful. She smiled as always and went home. As I enter the classroom the day after, I see that the seat next to me she always sat in was empty, she hadn't showed up. I was honestly a little worried when I did not see her because I started to appreciate her for being so sweet and innocent. I then started asking around and was told that she had taken her own life the night before. I'm in shock and I still havent washed the hand she drew the cherry blossom on, I dont want it to go it's the only thing left I have of her. Why would she do that? How can I ever recover from this gut wrenching experience ? It's pushing me to do it at this point.

Cons:

As a complication of chemotherapy and cancer I was diagnosed with two pain syndromes, APMS and CRPS, both have the nickname of the “suicide disease” because they are so painful.
Lately my pain syndromes have been getting worse even though I have a high pain tolerance.
 I used to be on pain medications including oxycondone, morphine, tramadol and marninol, but because of the opioid crisis and since I was done with chemo, they took them away and now I’m left with Motrin and celebrex.

I don’t really wanna d*e so I probably won’t attempt again.

everything was manageable despite all this, up until i injured myself in the gym 2 months ago, i was doing a tricep extension movememnt, and the rope snapped and pulled me back, it pulled me to the left and i did a snappy movement. 

  
i thought it was fine at first, but 2 months later im still having a headache, and pain in my left arm, ive got no numbness, but just pain. i had 7 sessions of physiotherapy with no improvement. i went to 3 different doctors, all gave me muscle relaxants and massage gels, nothing worked. I cant do an MRI because of my braces.

  
and now im considering suicide as the last resort. but the fear of being crippled for life keeps me from jumping, but i dont know for how much longer this will prevent me from doing it.

  
ive got no anchor, noone to live for, not my family, not friends, everyone has betrayed me in some way, some used my pain to tell me how god is punishing me for being non religious, some just called me a retard and betrayed me and gave me no reason, some were just sexist. 

  
i dont really see the point in living, the point of studying, if my own body is failing me. im only considering suicide because i dont see any other options, yet i dont even have a method of doing it yet. ive heard stories of people surviving dangerous falls, 10 stories even, i dont have a ""guaranteed"" way to die and that scares me. Overdosing will lead to kidney failure, jumping will lead to spine injuries and being crippled for life, cutting will prbably do nothing because im sure my body wont let me cut myself, and it may be painful. 

  
ive recently started to battle my own mind in some way, im scared of it constantly telling me to end myself, i clearly dont want to die, yet i clearly see no other option to end this pain.

  
say i survive this, what next? this world treats non useful people like trash, if im disabled, cant work, no one will do anything for me. i live in a third world country with unreliable adults. my mom and dad are divorced, ii dont live with either of them. i wish i had a mom all to my own, but they remarried and have other kids of their own. they never gave me their attention. 

  
i dont see a point, to anything. yes my mom told me we will search for a doctor together tomorrow at 1pm, but since physiotherapy ddint work what will i do next? why will i force myself to live with this type of chronic pain?

  
its not fair, i tried to be careful in so many ways, i ate healthy, studied a lot, exercised, yet i still end up with this.

  
i find the world disgusting, i find people disgusting, i never feel in the moment, i always feel like im in third person, i cant have fun i cant do anuthing. my family disgusts me. 

  
i wish i had an answer to all this pain, i wish it would all end. ive got no dreams or aspirations, all of them were just to escape the pain, but if the pain is now in my body, the only solution now is to die.

edit: i also dont really see the point in talking to a “trusted” friend to vent or ask for emotional support when all my pain is from the physical side and they arent doctors. i am searching for solutions and other doctors but i dont know what i will do when i find nothing in this mess.

  I’ve been dealing with controlling and abusive narcissists for 20 years that now that I’m free I don’t know what to do.

But I haven’t been able to find a job because I guess I’m not qualified enough, and I don’t want him to be homeless but I know he can support himself, and that me being unemployed is dragging him down. This wouldn’t be the first time either. It was so bad to the point where even my father had told my brother to be careful with me that I don’t drag him down with me.

I don’t have many friends and I avoid them all the time. I can’t bond with them like they do with each other. I’m only friends with them to begin with because of my cousin, and I don’t even feel close to him anymore. The only friend that I was truly close with, my best friend, died of an OD. I was close to him and his gf and all three of us went through substance abuse. To be honest, that time period was the most fun I’ve had in my life. 

My last hope was my girlfriend and I ruined that too. I became such a horrible person and I brought her down with me. She was uncomfortable with how close I was with my friend’s girlfriend and we talked about it so many times and I lied over and over again. I never wanted her or anything like that, I just didn’t want to lose that connection because of everything we went through together. I didn’t realize until now, how much I didn’t need her, I only needed my girlfriend. 

We broke up two weeks ago and I really don’t know how I can keep going. We were so sure we could make it but I ruined it like everything in my life. After my last OD, I told my girlfriend I blocked her but I lied and kept talking to her. I finally blocked her and cut contact two months after that. These last few months were amazing. My girlfriend and I were at our best. We were literally best friends. She found out that I lied last year and she broke up with me. She couldn’t do it anymore. After so many times of the same situation, this finally did it. Even if this year I was honest with her and I tried so hard to be better, but I hurt her too much. 

Now I just keep playing it over and over in my head. How I much hurt I caused her, how good we could’ve been right now, and if only I realized things sooner, things would’ve been different right now. We’re still talking but I don’t think I’ll convince her to stay. She still loves me and doesn’t want us to be over and that hurts so much. Talking to her hurts so much. We’re fine one moment but then we realize how we’re not together. Then she gets mad and starts blowing up on me. I hate it and it hurts but I just take it because i’m sure it’s not even close to the damage I did. 

Everything in my life is back to shit. I worked so hard to beat my addiction, but it was one of the only times I felt good. The other time was the time I had with my girlfriend and now that’s gone.

Here's the highlights, first 7 years of his life he experienced extreme food security, physical abuse, sexual abuse, pimped out by his mother to feed a habit. His preteen/teen years weren't awesome, raised by grandparents that loved him but did nothing to adress his you, he was violent, shot 3 separate times, stabbed twice, ran over intentionally and lost 23 friends mostly to violence before 18.

He's been married around 20yrs, 22yr old son and a 15 yr old daughter from an affair (little contact). His wife is awesome, son is a typical 22yr old. Guy's been unemployed for nearly a year and struggling to gain employment. Says not working has him sitting around having visual, audible, physical physical hallucinations. Say even smells their breath. 

 The dude has always been a hustler and told me recently the work keeps his mind busy. He's had 3 failed attempts and is ready to finish. Compared it to being at a bad movie and the only way to mute it is leave the theater. 

He set a time table, that if he isn't employed by a set date. He's either hunting sex offenders a child abusers before ending his life in his mother's driveway, or skip the hunt and off himself at his mom's.

1mp1qzv,about 14,"hi all, this is just a kind of suicide note-type letter to myself. im about to overdose on like 5 different kind of pills. just a 14 year old girl with nothing to her name and no achievements to speak of. to say i lived a rather unsatisfactory  life would be an understatement. this is very long winded be warned.

life has been tough. i failed a different overdose attempt earlier this year.  
on the day i took a fatal dose, i caved in and told my teacher about my life. my attempt. fine, they could call police, get an ambulance. as long as they made me feel better.  
everybody said that telling somebody your trusted would make everything feel better. how badly i craved  that was honestly pathetic.  
  
i didn’t really want to die anyway. i think i just wanted a contrived escape from this pitiful excuse of a ‘life’. i wanted solace, and comfort. everybody said tell a trusted teacher. but damn, it’s like she spat in my hand and told me that’s my meal for the day.

forget anything about comfort, i cried and broke down, all she said was ""it gets better honey"". really? do i look stupid. how many times do you think Ives gotten that exact phrase regurgitated at me in twenty different fonts? i felt stupid for trying to even get anybody to understand. 

I told her. “my mother won’t care if I live or die, as long as it doesn’t affect her.” “I’m a mother, I would hate if my daughter was struggling like this.“ she said.  How many times do you think other people have said that to me? its stupid. but what’s even more stupid, is I tried to believe her. I deluded myself into thinking my mother would care. but that made the harsh reality even harsher.

after I got discharged, my mother said she i could kill myself, she couldnt give less a fuck. just keep it away from her, and do it successfully next time. i heard them (the staff) gossip about my suicide attempt the day after, which I attempted school right after. forget a break, they could care less. fuck all those who said tell a teacher. never do. they don’t care. they are paid to listen. 

to get all my grievances out, i hate my face. I hate my body. I hate the fact that im a girl. I hate the fact that my male classmates talked about my privates in my face, disgusting, I hate the fact that they look down on me. I hate that my body is sexualized just because a guy wants to like me. I hate that I have no friends. I hate that I have a bad personality. I hate that I’m obese. I hate that I have an eating disorder. I hate that the way I look. I hate my voice. I hate my life.

I like sweets. I like manga. I like books. I like web novels. I like talking to people. I like hanging out. I like the winter chill of snow that lingers on your ears. I like the feeling of laughing. I like my sister a lot. I like people.  I like the rain.

I believe in those cool reincarnation fantasy books. I would like to believe I’ll get sent to a cool world with magic powers like what I watch on television occasionally. I hope I become a beautiful princess who lives in those European magical worlds. I hope I get born with a golden finger in my next life.

The actions are what define a person as bad which is why I think I’m a bad person. Anyone who could see my past actions would think the same. Am I feeling bad of the actions because of fear of consequences or am I feeling bad because I think they’re bad. I don’t know anymore. I can’t answer those questions because I don’t know who I am. ,1755124957.0,4,6,SuicideWatch,suicide

1monqdk,Why do so many young people from first world countries want to commit suicide?,"Hello! I noticed that many teens (14–18 years old) from first-world countries want to commit suicide, and that got me thinking: what is happening there?

  
I’m from Rio, Brazil, and even though there is the touristic side of Rio, about 80% of the city lives in favelas, with illnesses caused by the lack of sewage (toilets flush directly into the streets), adults and children being killed by drug gangs in wars with the police, families living with 6 to 10 people in improvised houses, and many with absent or drug-addicted fathers.  
Even so, it's so so extremely rare hear about teenagers in those favelas commit suicide.

  
But I see many comments from teenagers in Sweden, the USA, Denmark, Canada, etc., who have good homes, schools, parents, and no gang wars, yet want to end their lives.

I was mistreated growing up because I wasn’t normal so I started pretending to have emotions I didn’t have by copying everyone else around me. But im just a husk at this point. I tried to devote myself to making other people happy in my place but instead I just get used and taken advantage of before I get thrown away. I’m so tired. I’m so tired of this, I joined the navy for some type of structure and foundation but nothing has changed people are still evil and I still am a tool. I tried to call the people “close to me” and no one answered Ive been to therapy and it doesn’t work, I’ve been on so many pills and meds and all they do is break me down physically. I can barely walk outside without getting overwhelmed and anxious just walking past people. I hate this life so much all I try to do is good and everyone is so evil and mean. I never had any grand wishes I just wanted to have someone who loved me the way I love and a home I can pour my energy into. I have nothing to look forward to in life. I can’t relate to people because I’m too autistic to relate but not the useful autistic I physically can’t exist without reading into every little action or motion. I used sex as a substitute for love because people can never care for me as a person but they like the way I fuck. I only trained my body so that someone might desire me. I only got tattoos to be more attractive so someone would see me. I am nothing I’ll never matter or be loved. All I wanted was to be loved. I have no one and nothing and through my 22 years of living I’ve never had a day of peace I’m tired. I couldn’t buy a gun because im on the risk list or whatever and the navy has me on the do not arm list so im gonna take the rest of my prozac and if i wake up ill go to the shooting range and do it there.

i don’t like to go on about my family because my problems aren’t as bad as some but it’s all i know. isn’t it normal for me to feel bad? when i talk about being stressed because of school, adults are always telling me it doesn’t get any better as if that makes me happy to hear.

i fear the future because i know that even if i do get through the best i can im simply living to get by. i’ll laugh when im happy, smile around my friends all that but as soon as i stop, as soon as i go home its as if nothing happened.

Everyone assumed it was for attention ect for years. Iv had so many head injuries and been so close to dying as Iv had bad seizures that wouldn’t stop. They diagnosed with epilepsy from 21 and I got treated like a human at hospital not like I was a psycho. Now all of a sudden The diagnosed me with non epileptic seizures and I can’t cope. The treatment I get is disgusting I’m just left to deal with it when I know something isn’t right. I stopped breathing during them, oxygen levels go down to 80s and my heart rate goes to 200. 

I’m now 23 living in my own flat I have no friends, family don’t understand or help I’m hopeless.

1mpn06w,Is there a way to get people to pay attention to me without putting myself in imminent danger,"I've pretty much developed this habit from childhood. While I was never entirely ignored, compared to my siblings I was always ""off to the side"", not really the focus. I was the ""easy child"". 

Among friends if I could call them that, I was typically the punching bag for fair reasons I guess. And every time I had learned if I wanted to recieve kindness and attention, to just feel like someone actually even cared I existed, was to do something ""drastic"" or ""shocking"". 

Of course it eventually fades, it wears off and people eventually get sick of it. But there's nothing about me worth caring about otherwise. I can TRY to be more interesting. But it's always just an act. I'm just forcing myself. It makes the feelings that I was never meant to be cared about even stronger. So I go back to the usual and abuse people's empathy all over again. I make harshly self-deprecating comments for validation, I express how much I want to kill myself if it wasn't the fact I can't overcome the fear that comes with it (which genuinely is true at least), and I self harm just hoping someone can see the scars (or bruises) and care about me. 

I know I'm a terrible person. But it gets old. Especially with social media. I have to stand out even more in a sea of people doing the same things. I have to make my suicidal ideations seem more intense than the last 50 people who tried just to hope someone will care. I have to amplify and over-exaggerate things I have gone through, just to get someone to care. And I guess this post is just another cry for help, because I don't know how to handle it. These things I feel ARE real, but instead of keeping them inside like I should, I use these feelings to abuse empathy. It's the only thing that have ever worked for someone to actually care.

1mpbesj,How do I cope with suicidal thoughts after a breakup?,"My girlfriend broke up with me at the start of the year. I have been struggling with depression since I was a teenager. I miss her so much, but everytime I think about her I realize how far she‘s gone emotionally and I‘m stuck in this mental tarpit trying to make sense of things. I am not in contact with her anymore but I see a little into her life after the breakup through social media posts by her friends. 

Since then my suicidal thoughts which I had under control for quite some time returned. I have a loving family and friends, but there‘s still so much emptiness she left behind, which I cannot distract myself from anymore. I‘m just so done with therapies and meds. They do help in the sense that I can sleep through the night and live through the day, but internally I‘m so unhappy. I miss this woman so much but I‘m sure I don‘t cross her mind at all anymore. 
I‘d hate to do this to my parents and my brother since I had a grandfather and other relatives who already committedor tried, but I just don‘t see any improvements, only up phases which eventually all break down again. I‘ve been dealing with this for 10 years now which is almost half my life. I just want out.

I‘m on a waitlist for „professional“ help, but I got a bachelorsdegree in Businesspsychology, which yes „real“ psychologists also covers psychological issues. There‘s a real chance I won‘t get this help for a few months and even if, I‘m pretty sure theres not many new things they can teach me.

I knew her for a couple years and recently got back into contact with her again and we basically became friends with benefits. I have a really close bond with her like with nobody I’ve ever had with before. I’ve never felt so strongly about someone in my life at all. 

Now I feel like she’s drifting away and it’s destroying me right now. I think I have abandonment issues. My mom left me so I went to go live with my dad and he kicked me out a week before my 18th. My closest family betrayed me and it’s put such a deep scar on me that when something good like this comes it actually makes me happy for once. Like life’s worth living again. 

Now that it feels like she’s going her own way I seriously am starting to get strong feelings of abandonment and betrayal. I think in my head with emotions from all sides of anger and sadness then I reel back because I love her and crave her again. It’s not fun. 

I’m just so lonely now idk what I have to live for. All I want in life is to have my own family, my own people. And it’s just getting ripped away.

Now it's just back to unbearable loneliness and suffering. I don't enjoy anything, I never have enjoyed doing anything. And trying to make actual meaningful connections with anyone anymore feels so useless and fake. The moment you talk about how you really feel about anything people run away or change the topic.

All I ever wanted was to die ever since I can fucking remember and all the world keeps doing is proving me right because it's just trauma after trauma and betrayal after betrayal every time. Even if it wasn't, this place doesn't make me happy. People say that if everyone else around you is the problem then the problem must be yourself, but it really is every single person I've ever known. It feels like the world is rigged against me and no matter what I do it leads to cruelty, suffering and tragedy.

And it feels like a prison too because the whole world is just designed for people to try and convince you into staying alive as if dying is bad by default.

1mpm8ih,23.5m no skill can't fit started thinking deeply and my reason is trash,"I've been really thinking about life lately, contemplating about myself which I know I'm the cause. I need an escape for my situation. I'll just list it down my reasons without sequence.

I've been introverted person since I was a kid, I don't like to communicate. I always can't connect to people.

4th grade I was operated for appendicitis, which makes me think I was misdiagnosed because I heard the the convo between my parents and doc they didn't find anything unusual in the operation. The stitch from my stomach left hip to right hip always make me think about that time.

I have a pet tarantula, i got it trying to fit with my classmate that time (I tried to connect whereas I'll like what they like). I started to love the pet. But when I was in my 1st year college where I'm starting awol, I became depressed (I don't know if it is), that it got caught with my misery. It died because of my lack of sense of responsibility. I buried it, I stared at it. Made me think, damn I'm so trashy. 

I'm in college taking the course that I though would fit me, but isn't. I'm already at my 6 years going 7, due to my poor decision making. I went awol in my 1st years 2nd sem because every time I think about it it burns me. I bounced back promised myself to do better, but still not enough I'm just a dumb boi. Now I'm even in the verge of stopping again because I always fail my subject. I have 3 siblings and I always imagine the cost. 
The worst part is everytime when my father asked how was school I replied it was okay, it squished my heart so much lying in front of him. 

My parents thought I'm a good child because I'm always quiet. They didn't know that I just don't have interest in things. 

I don't like to receive things because I feel guilty if I became happy whereas I know I'm on the verge of falling my life. I'm never happy about my life, even though I'm privileged that I have a loving parents. 

I'm definitely wasting my parents resources on me, and I know it. 

I always think of the sacrifices of my parents, when I start thinking about, it started to pull me down even more. 
Now the splash of reality starting to hit me even more, I'm too weak for this world. I can't even do a conversation to other person how can I survive. I don't have friends, No lovelife, Losing interest to my hobby(gaming) I don't have the grit to survive to find work.

I really cant see myself living in this world. I'm too weak.
I became so trashy person that I found comfort on other peoples delimma, I hate myself thinking about it. I even think that getting cancer or illnesses or accident lucky. If only I could swap life of that dying person I would.

I just can't imagine myself in the future, no skill no grit to acquire skill, poor health can't do labor, can't get accepted even labor work, too dumb for office work. Want to go to military but can't bcs of medical records. I scared what other people will say which they are already are so I distanced myself but they still find me haha. I got the feeling that my parents are starting to lose hope for me. I just don't fit.

Im too weak in this reality, I really want that escape, I know it's so selfish of me knowing the impact it would make to my healthy family, but that will be the last time I'll be selfish. I'd like it to be accidental or maybe a sickness. Tell me your methods.

1mpm0rg,Can someone give me a reason to stay?,"please give me a reason to stay

I don’t even know where to start. I just feel done. Like I’ve been holding on so long with bloody hands and nobody even sees it. Every day feels heavier than the last, and I’m at the point where I’m begging the universe for a reason, just one reason, to keep going. I’ve been trying to be strong for so long, trying to carry myself through all of this, but I’m worn down to nothing.

I give so much to people. I love hard, I stay loyal, I stick around even when it hurts. But in the end, I’m always the one left standing there wondering what I did wrong, why I wasn’t enough, why everyone I’d go to war for just disappears when I need them most. I’m tired of giving all of me to people who can’t or won’t give back. I’m tired of feeling invisible to the people who matter the most to me. I’m tired of caring so deeply and getting silence in return.

It’s a lonely feeling when the person you’d drop everything for can go days, weeks, or even months without talking to you. It’s like I’m screaming underwater, and everyone just keeps walking by. I’ve prayed, I’ve begged, I’ve pleaded, both to God and to the people I love, but all I get back is this crushing emptiness. And I’m starting to wonder if maybe that’s my answer, maybe this is just what life has for me.

I’m not asking for much. I’m not asking for grand gestures or perfect words. I just want someone to make me feel like I matter. Like I’m worth staying for. Like I’m worth loving. I want someone to fight for me the way I’ve fought for them. I want to stop feeling like I’m replaceable, like the second someone gets bored or overwhelmed, I’m just gone from their life.

I’ve been trying to convince myself it’s going to get better, that I just have to wait, that maybe tomorrow will be the day something changes. But tomorrow keeps coming, and it keeps being the same. I don’t know how many more tomorrows I have left in me without something real to hold onto. I just need a reason, any reason, to believe I’m not wasting my time, my energy, my love.

I’m so tired of being the one who stays while everyone else leaves. I’m so tired of wondering why I’m not worth it. I just want someone to show me I am. I need that reason to stay. I need something to grab onto when it feels like I’m slipping away. Because right now, I feel like I’m disappearing piece by piece, and nobody even notices. And the scariest part is that if I’m gone one day, I’m starting to believe it wouldn’t change a thing for anyone. I don’t want to feel that way anymore. I just need someone, anyone, to prove me wrong.

Please bring it back as an option to report someone when reporting via their profile page. Currently my only option is to report their username and there is nowhere to paste the link to the reddit cares message because notifications can’t be linked to even if you can copy it via the notification itself.

1mp7llx,How to deal with extreme social anxiety (meds and therapy didn’t help) - due to neurological disorders,"Tried many different meds and seen some good, some bad psychiatrists. Anyway, they are not the problem. I am 30 btw.


I have several genetic and neurological disorders (some of them very rare) that made me badly facially deformed. Not just a part of my face but my whole face and head are bad. I have treatment resistant insomnia, also due to one of these disorders. My muscles are disappearing slowly due to one of these neurological conditions and partly a side effect of a med I HAVE to take or risk seizures. Yes I’m in physio. 


Due to these disorders, I am not treated well by most in society. Most people treat me unkindly - strangers mostly. And back when I was in school and in person college. Mostly not directly but they did joke about me and looked at me with hate.

Anyway. I live at home with my mother, she buys me food and clothes, and is sad about my situation. She takes me shopping sometimes as exposure therapy. But it backfires mostly as I realise how most people react to me.

I’ve applied to various jobs but no luck yet. I have my distance learning degree to finish in September, and I’m behind on my dissertation. I have no more slack that could be cut for me. 

When my mom will pass, so will I. Probably by drowning. Then it will look like an accident and my sister will get my life insurance. Also no trauma due to suicide for her or for any third party.


Every day is either stress, sadness, fear or anger or a mix of these. I do not know any other emotion. 
Objectively, I have little reason to live. Except for my mother.

Day in and day out I just do the same mundane painful things. I am in so much emotional pain it hurts. My husband doesn’t care about my feelings. He only cares about my abilities and my „performance“. How I can be a pleasant human being to him. He is what matters. Maybe I am the problem. But I can’t live like this. I want someone to love me for me. To see the light in me. I constantly have to prove myself to be valuable and loveable. I am STUCK. I have no where to go. I have no one I can be. In the words of my husband and mother I am pathetic. There’s good moments too. But then the bad come. I am not here for someone to tell me to leave my husband or cut contact with my mom. It’s far far from simple. I guess I am just seeking humanity. I haven’t felt it in a while. Just a person seeking to understand me. Just some love. I sometimes really want to end it but I can’t leave my children. And I am scared to die. All I want is some love. And not having  to earn it. I always have to earn it first. I just… I don’t know.

1mpimlm,I'm 19 and I've completely fucked my life.,"I'm a 19 year old F uni student (ha). I completely failed first year, I'm going to lose my accommodation for the next year (my scholarship is only valid for progression not retaking) because I was too fucking lazy to get up and go to class or submit the bare minimum. I don't know what I was thinking, doing less than the bare minimum and expecting to pass anyway. I went to uni, got a boyfriend that I'm now completely reliant on, work once a week because I'm too unreliable to be given shifts, abused weed, mdma and ket for months by myself or with idiots just so I didn't feel so fucking miserable all the time. I wish I was at least an addict then I'd have a reason to be fucked up. University was my dream since I was a kid, I thought it would be like fucking Hogwarts or something and I'd magically find my people (spoiler alert I only have 3 genuine friends (at home), everyone else I'm too fucking awkward and adhd to act normal around) but most of the people I've met are just awful and my morals are too strong to put up with it. How can people be friends with people who believe immigrants need to be sent to camps? I don't understand anything and cannot function as an adult. I irritate the people around me constantly with non-stop faux pas and my need to prove myself as intelligent, funny etc. I know I'm worthless but I'm obsessed with making people think I'm not. I hate university but it's my only option and I don't even know if I'm going to be able to continue with it. The cherry on fucking top is my fosterparents are moving abroad and selling their house in three years right as I finish uni, so I'm going to be homeless anyway. The only people I've ever called family are leaving me. My only options are to move in with my boyfriend (which would be a burden to his large family) or my biological dad (he has a new family and made it clear me moving in was a last resort). My biological mother lives with my eldest brother who sexually abused me, so that's not an option. My other brother, my only biological family I love, is schizophrenic and is a shell of who he used to be. Day to day life is already so fucking hard. I can't eat, I have no energy to exercise, I just lie around all day. My life is completely meaningless and my future is fucking bleak to put it bluntly. Everyone keeps telling me I'm smart and a good person and it'll work out blah blah but every time I take a step in the right direction I go ten steps back. My boyfriend is the light of my life and him, my best friend and my fosterparents are my only reasons to keep going, but I hate myself so much and I just suffer every day in order to stop the people around me from grieving. I am not the person I thought I would be at 19. I'm half the person I was a few years ago. How can I be so young and shit suck this much?

1moztp5,Really getting close…,"33yr old male. Aussie. Been suicidal/near suicidal for I’d say at least the last 20yrs.

I really don’t know what’s kept me here. Hope that things’ll somehow get better? Fear of death? 

But things have steadily just gotten worse and worse, both inside my life and in general.

I don’t I need to mention all the shit going wrong with the world. Poor people getting squeezed more and more, rich getting richer, the cruel and evil getting lives of affluence while everyone else struggles from day to day.

And me personally, I’ve had and dealt with anxiety, depression and ADHD/Autism severely and chronically for most of my life. Been on multiple medications. Spoken to psychiatrists/psychologists/etc over and over.

I’ve also had Crohn’s disease for over 14yrs now; which for those who don’t know, it’s a disgusting, crippling and limiting disease that’s also all internal, so of course people always assume you’re overplaying how much you’re struggling because of it. 
Or having to go to the toilet regularly at work it’s assumed you’re skipping out on duties etc when you’re spending 20-30mins in there - so of course that means struggling to hold onto work.

In my 14yrs of working, I’ve almost always been in warehousing, and have barely been able hold a position at a place for more than a couple months before they had enough of me and fired me - or the stress at the place was so bad I either offed myself on the spot or left; so I left. 

I also had cancer a few years back, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma - which I feel seems to have some sorta residual effects as well.

I’m just tired all the time. I don’t have the energy or the will to go to a doctor, handle household chores, do anything constructive etc. 

Yet even in Australia, with our fabulous healthcare, I am unable to get the help I need. I don’t qualify for disability, I don’t qualify for government assistance. But I don’t have the health or the energy to keep up work.

My Crohn’s has been treated by several different medications over the years - usually I’m on it for several months, it does nothing then I wait a few months - usually on steroids to tide me over - then they move onto something else.

Right now I’ve been almost a month off my latest medication - Rinvoq - cause the PBS aka the government hasn’t decided whether they’re gonna continue to fund me for the medication - something that seemed to be working and that I can’t afford on my own. 

Meanwhile my entire body is going to shit. My joints are aching and crumbling from the Crohn’s and immunosuppressants (which are the only treatment for Crohn’s btw), I’m slowly gaining more and more weight whilst being too tired or anxiety/depression ridden to work out. 

I’ve got at least $20,000 worth of dental work I need to get done that keeps getting worse.

Meanwhile I don’t even know what tf I’m saving my money up for considering I’m never gonna be able buy a house or anything, let alone retire or some such.
And don’t know how much longer I can keep working, especially where I am, at a medical supplies company that overcharges the elderly and enfeebled people they supply to whilst underpaying and under protecting their employees.
FairWork and SafeWork aren’t doing shit, there’s no chance of getting a union in cause no-one cares. 

And I expect I’ll be dead by 60-65 anyway. Just spend the next ~30yrs suffering before I die anyway. 

I feel closer and closer to offing myself every day. And I dunno what to do. It’s all real-world shit that I can’t fix, that talking about won’t solve…",1755077609.0,6,10,SuicideWatch,suicide

My kid won’t listen to me, their dad died in November last year because he decided to get drunk and go swimming in the river, the love of my life passed away unexpectedly on my brother’s 17th birthday in 2021 due to pancreatic cancer, my mom is sick with stage 4 lung cancer, I’m constantly on the verge of being homeless/having to live in my car, I just had to place my daughter for adoption after she was born because I have no support system and one child is already too much. I can’t even get it together and find a decent daycare so I can work full time and take care of us. 



Just this past month my mom finally told me that the abusive, piece of shit monster I grew up thinking was my father actually wasn’t. My real father is unable to be located and doesn’t even know I exist. My mom and brother gifted me a Labubu plushie to comfort me about giving my baby up for adoption and my only “friend” convinced me that it was evil and had me throw it away, and now she’s being a total c**t to me and I don’t even think she’s my friend anymore. 



Nobody even likes me, why am I even here still? My own child doesn’t like me. My mom is the only person who loves me other than Jesus and she is sick and I can’t cope with it. 



I fucking hate my life, and I’m tired of suffering and dealing with PTSD from my spouse dying. It’s been since 2021, no I will not fucking just “get over it,” nobody even fucking cared. Nobody sent flowers or a card except my fucking job recruiter.

Who cares, that’s over with now and has been for quite some time.

1mp2e4x,Grasping at straws here,"Honestly idk what to do, where to go, or who to talk to. I have professional help. I’ve been seeing a therapist for the past year and just finally got a psychiatrist who, just like all the rest, won’t keep my appointments and just reschedules them. I’ve been seeing various therapists and psychiatrists since I was 12 and I’m 22 now. I’m pretty sure I’m worse off now than I ever was but that’s probably just to do with being an adult now. No one is required to care about me lmao. Slipped right through all the cracks in school. So many times I wish they called cps to get me away from my family. But all of my mandated reporters forgor I guess. 

I just want to die. Life is fucking pain. I try to get help and people say “don’t you know everyone is in pain??” Like great that solves it. If that’s really the answer then why don’t I kill myself. If there’s nothing that can be done and I am the problem then why do I bother. If the only person who can help me is me, and I fucking hate me, then why should I keep trying when clearly I am not capable of fixing this damage. 

My parents and older brothers fucking HATED me growing up. From preschool to probably 4th grade my brother got to watch me after school, so every afternoon I got off the bus with him, I’d grab as many snacks as I could and run to the upstairs bathroom to lock the door so he couldn’t hurt me. When I was in kindergarten he was in 8th grade so that’s the age difference. If he caught me out of the bathroom, he would hit me, or sit on me while watching tv while I cry and can’t breathe, or hold me in place to burn me with a magnifying glass, or pull my pants off and shoot my legs/ass with his air soft rifle at close range, or whatever the fuck else he felt like since I was half his age, a quarter of his size, and our parents drank so much they didn’t give a shit unless they were hitting both of us for it. My mom woke me up for school every morning hung over, screaming at me, and slapping me when I talk back. I had to get major dental work done as an adult because apparently she broke the root of one of my adult teeth while it was growing in, so it split into two teeth and one went straight up into my head causing excruciating pain that I had no explanation for since she took me to the dentist a total of one time in my life. It ended up causing a marble sized abscess in my gum and that was when I took myself to the dentist, then a specialist, then an endodontic specialist, to get a very fancy root canal that cost me literally fucking everything. I’ve been fucking broke ever since then and that was two years ago it was my whole savings and I haven’t been able to work consistently enough since then to make it back while still surviving. 

With shit like this, it makes me think the world is so endlessly fucked up, there’s nothing I can do about it, I will always be seen as the problem and I don’t have a solution. I really tried working hard. I was working 40-60 hour weeks for half a year taking care of adults with disabilities and then my car broke down and I had to spend all of my savings again to fix it, only for it to break down AGAIN six months after a whole fucking engine swap. It’s just been sitting and rusting because I don’t have money for that either. 

I haven’t been working for the past two years because my boyfriend told me it wasn’t good for me. It wasn’t so I quit. Since then we’ve gotten an apartment together and he pays for everything except my food since I have food stamps. I’ve been seeing my therapist and trying fucking everything they offer at that clinic. I haven’t a case manager there who doesn’t manage Jack shit because I always end up needing my boyfriend to help me, a psychiatrist who doesn’t keep appointments unless they’re 20minute or less, a talk therapist who is amazing but can only do so much, and I’m doing tms which I’m pretty sure might just be hacky bullshit because here I am as suicidal as ever two months in. I tried their community support where they try to have a person help you with like grocery shopping and going to the gym and that was just awful and anxiety riddling. I’m trying their dbt group but I genuinely don’t think it’ll help me seeing as how I’m extremely familiar with all the content and it hasn’t helped me yet. 

Now I’m pretty sure my boyfriend is sick of me after two years. He won’t admit it, he just bottles up all his anger and then explodes on me and says the most vile shit to me and then apologizes after and does it again. I’m seeing pretty much the same thing from him that I’ve seen from all my other abusers, he’s just not abusing me yet is all. The other night we got into a fight and I don’t even know why. We were working on my moped engine together and we were having a great time and then all of a sudden he just starts snapping at me and getting pissed and there’s no way for me to de escalate so I walked away. So he followed me. He said shit like he doesn’t even know if my mental issues are real or if I’m just coercing him into taking care of me, that I’m a massive bitch (my mom loved using that one OOF), that I’m mean and evil, that all of my problems are my fault, that I ruined his life, that I take all of his happiness and make it impossible for him to be happy, and much much more. I don’t think I responded for the most part because I’m used to being emotionally barraged, I just shut down. He didn’t like that so he kept escalating. At one point I freaked out and started smashing my metal water bottle against my head and he had to tackle me to restrain me which definitely didn’t help the overwhelming panic. That’s how that goes though for me. I can take things up until a point and then I start acting like a methed up rat in a too small cage. I think that’s the suicidal urges bubbling through because all I really wanted in that moment was any lack of consciousness to stop what was happening since I didn’t have any other way to make it stop. I ended up walking two hours to our apartment from his parents house, and then I hid in the closet because that’s what I do when I’m scared. He just kept opening the closet door to say mean shit and closing it to get the last word but it’s not like I was responding anyways. Eventually I couldn’t take that anymore and I just walked almost to the next state in the night. He picked me up eventually and cried and apologized and all that and we talked it over but this just keeps happening and it gets so much worse every time. I don’t know what to do. I’m just making him hate me like I make everyone hate me because I am evil. I am just an incorrect type of human and I really think the world would be better off without me in it. The world is already shit it doesn’t need more people like me to keep living and draining resources and causing problems. 

I also have chronic unexplained pain in all of my joints and I’ve tried fucking everything to fix and or diagnose it but who knows it’s probably just because I’m lazy even though I spent years running for a job at one point and they hurt just the same. I’ve done all sorts of blood tests and X-rays and everything looks fine so the doctors tell me it’s all in my head and tell me to fucking exercise as though they didn’t hear me tell them about all the exercise I used to get until the pain got so bad that I just couldn’t anymore. But regardless, even when my head is okay, my body fucking hurts and no one has an answer for it so WHY. why is everyone so dead set on convincing me I have reasons to live and things to be happy about. I can’t enjoy anything and I make everyone’s lives worse around me. I need to die. It feels like something I need to do. If not for me then for everyone else. 

Part of me wants people to see this and offer kind words, and the other part of me hopes that everyone says “yeah you’re right just do it” so idk say what you will nothing has helped yet and maybe I’ll even be able to pluck up the courage to take myself out. ",1755086193.0,3,15,SuicideWatch,suicide

Coworkers ask me if I’m going to have kids. No, they’re too much responsibility. I’ve never had that motherly instinct to drive me to grow old and reproduce. They ask what I’ll do when I’m old and need help. I say I’ll die when I can’t do the things I want and laugh. 

I used to dream of living in a small town, riding my bike around, and just helping people in their daily lives. I don’t care for money. I don’t care for pop culture. I don’t care about social media really. I just wanted to live my life in a cute, pedestrian-friendly town, and help people. Maybe write a book. I also wanted to do something that helped nature flourish and sent me on adventures through the wilderness where I could stand in awe and be present. 

I still dream of that in some vague sense. I desperately want to travel and see the world before climate change severely impacts the places I want to see, but it’s already happening. I don’t care to put my money into a retirement fund… I don’t think I’ll have one to use anyways.

1mohri5,I WISH I HAD SUCCEEDED BRO,"Three months ago, I attempted suicide after getting rejected by a girl, but failed. Today, I did something I really shouldn’t have, I checked her social media. She’d blocked me, but I used a throwaway account. She’s living her life just like before. From the outside, you’d never guess what happened three months ago. Meanwhile, I’m left with deep, visible scars on both wrists and permanent muscle loss in my left one. I’ve been on a pile of medication for the past three months and will have to keep taking it for a long time.

I wish the only problem had been her, so I could at least tell myself, “there are still other things worth living for.” Working in a corporate job has turned me into a complete misanthrope. I go the whole day at work without saying a word to anyone, then go home. I don’t have a single person I talk to regularly. I can’t fake being happy and energetic anywhere, so people don’t care about me or even want to meet me. Even the ones who told me after my attempt “you can talk to me anytime” were just acting, none of them are here now. My wrists might heal someday, but the damage in my head never will.

1mp7kwu,"My best friend is broken, and I'm worried for him. What could I do to help him?","Let's call him Dan, he'll be 25 in a few days. We've been friends since kindergarten. He was bullied in school and abused at home, which as he says, turned him into a ""very huggable marshmallow"". Generally he's a happy guy, always cheerful, always cheering others, helping in any way he can. He was always there for me when I was on my lowest, and I was there for him too.

The last couple weeks were impossible for him. We talked almost everyday as usual, but this was different. He said work got tough, and that I shouldn't worry, but a few days later I found out they're taking a break with his girlfriend of 5 years. I'm still not 100% clear on what happened exactly, but from what I got out of them both was, she needs a break because they got distant, and when he wanted to fix things (stop depressing over work and stuff), he went from 0% to 100%, which overwhelmed her, and just pushed them apart more.

Problem is, I know one thing that his gf doesn't know: he wanted to propose to her during his birthday. He got the ring a month ago (I went with him to shield it as ""shopping for tech stuff with me""), and he got a beautiful ring. He has his speech ready too, he read it to me because he felt nervous about it, and I literally couldn't stop crying for a day it was so beautiful.

Now that they're distant, he just doesn't text, doesn't really respond to anything, or just cuts everything short like ""I'm fine"" or ""nothing's up"".

I was with him yesterday and I talked to him, and it was like seeing a ghost. From that 1 month, he lost like 3 or 4 kgs, his eyes are just the most tired things I've ever seen, even his voice is broken. He stopped talking several times because his voice literally just broke/cracked.

I know I shouldn't have, but I checked into his laptop while he was out. He wrote goodbye letters to his GF, and it has stuff in it like ""I don't want to die but living in a world without my other half is just pointless"", and he also mentioned his sister wanting to suicide because of stress, which totally knocked him out (he didn't even tell me that).

I'm worried about him, idk what to do, and at this point, he won't even open up for me like he used to open up for more than 20 years.

I talked to his GF, and she said she doesn't want to break up with him, she just needs time, because for months he just locked himself into a depressive state, and suddenly he went from 0 to 100 at the thought of losing her. She also said she loves him, but she's a ""lone wolf type of person"", so she needs time to recharge alone, in quiet, without anyone bothering her - which I understand, but he's the complete opposite of this, he needs his partner to be on his side, that's how he recharges, with love and affection and feeling needed/wanted, and right now, he literally looks and feels like he's dying.

I don't know what to do. I'm on my way home from work, but this was ticking in my head all day long. I don't want him to kill himself, especially not for a girl for fucks sake...

What could I do? He's like a brother to me.

  
Edit, I took photos of some parts of the letter, and it has stuff like

""I don't want to die but living in a world without my other half is just pointless""  
""I know I fucked up, but I want to fix us, because I love you more than anything and anyone in my miserable little fucking life""  
""Please i just want to hear you say I love you again I just want to feel your hug feel that you care like you did for 5 years""  
""please don't break my heart, I know I'm easy to replace, worth less than a fucking plastic bag but I'm begging you, I'm nothing without you""  
""I'm just an empty lifeless shell without your love""

and lots of similar stuff.",1755098947.0,0,1,SuicideWatch,suicide
1mp21lj,Too much and no help,"hid my personality and thoughts so much didnt know what;'s real anymore

stopped feeling emotions everything became dull, health issues from repression

wanted to unalive after 30 or something but it would hurt relations and people along the way, yet I am not actually getting helped as much as I wanted to be. I feel like I can nurture others but society hates this and harasses and shames anyone into these things into oblivion, because others' lives are too easy or they are just plain sociopathic and don't care if something happens to themselves.  
There's people who understand someone can experience thisk ind of pain but not how ot support me, nor do I want to weigh on them. But there should be people who can understand me and suport me as I support others yet nowhere to be found.  
I admit maybe I wasted too much time trying to talk to people I don't fit in with because I had nowhere to go and most people need to socialise to not go insane.  
and I thought it may have been my fault I'm struggling anyway but years passed and I'm just rediscoveing I was right.  
It's stupid to watch others say express and believe some things I did years ago I was rejected for. Like I have to pretend we're friends now just because it's convenient for you.

Most don't have time because they want to waste it, not because they have something important to do. That's always the excuse. I had so many issues more than other people and yes I was interested in learning about others that's why I also wanted others to support me to support others, as I can't do everything and not get any help or help only with reluctance and payback, I know I'm not perfect either but this much discrepancy isn't right. And yeah you have to measure it eventually you can't be just goody two shoes like some people think it works in fairy tales, even Jesus wasn't exactly like that. He was good but not just a doormat.

Like I am endlessly punished for having forethought and trying to solve things. My fault for overthinking everything but of course if I end up slacking too much in one area it's my fault too and I should have known either way.

I've wasted years off my life. Other people are making memories, doing all and messing around. To top if off even if I get to do some fun things I could get shamed or looked down upon as I'm some stupid kid who doesn't want to grow up even tho I showed may more maturity when they were younger and I didn't get much recognition for it either.

If I say what I think I'm mean if I try to be nice I'm manipulative it's like that with everything and most are too myopic to try to see their own faults at the moment, then I get blamed for thinking too much, yet I was told to think a bit more, clearly it won't ever be enough. Normal people can't be spending this much time thinking about others and reconciling differences and perspectives, it's clear they aren't but their relationships and lives suffer because of it too, I don't need mine to get worse.

I'm afraid all the work I do can turn out to not be enough. All that and even if Jesus Christ helps me someone could still merc me later in life. Some people just have better lives and some never get the chance it is what it is but you could have at least been nice to the latter. No. You want to be a party animal and never care about anything and hut anyone who's upsetting your party.

I hate how I have no personal space. There's no where to cry for me without anyone hearing me.  It's none of their business. They won't support me when I need it but will come asking what's wrong when I want to be left alone, if they don't look at me with disgust and projections no one asked them for, that I know I won't be able to reconcile to them without getting myself tortured anyway.

There are times in my life where maybe I should have spoken up. I regret letting things go the way they did. E.g. people getting humiliated and shamed but I'd be an SJW if I spoke up. there were parts of the situation in my favor too I guess but I definitely wouldn't have gone through it without God helping me. Yet sometimes we get the wrong idea and hurt ourselves when trying to be brave. Then again my fault for not thinking enough or whatever.

The pain has built up over the years and gone through inside my body damaging it.

I was afraid if I succeeded at something good they would just think it was always easy for me and I made my issues up. Even tho they are obviously making theirs up to do just that because being successful makes them feel weird and they want to be ""normal""

You can have the most hurtful and vile thing happen to you and people will still look at you like ""who tf is this guy?"" and be concerned more about what service they can get out of you.

People are so spoiled. i didn't even hate them for it but they refuse to believe how bad things can go in someone's life and after you tell them they experience it as just intellectual information and forget about then they start pestering you about other nonsensical sh\*t. Like you tell them the most horrible thing, chronic health issues, literally no one I can connect to emotionally, I don't value only money and pleasure as I barely have either of them compared to them, authority figures and peers failed and epxloited me and they're like ""what about getting a job"" like are you stupid? You can't be that stupid. You offer me no things that take leverage of what I do have, you're just gonna force me to do something that won't work out just as it happenned repeatedly before you didn't even listen to me. All you can do is repeat.  I can't believe you're real people but this is what it is. How can I have all these issues and STILL have more empathy in me for someone in genuine need when you who have so much can't do that FOR A MINUTE FOR ME.  The truth is no one cares about you in society, almost no one. People just see each other as someone to gain pleasure from, not someone deeply connected with. There's barely any people like that and we get shamed into oblivion and non existence and have to pretend all the time that what's going no around us is normal.

I just want to leave this here for me to come back to later on, or perhaps hopefully look back on in years to come as a 'bad time'. And if this happens to resonate with other people, then that would be comforting too.

I (23M) am personally at the lowest point I have ever been in my entire life. I've struggled doing anything at all. From things as important as working to things as miniscule as brushing my own teeth. I wake up every morning and honestly wish I hadn't. I don't know exactly where my life dipped, and there are too many reasons racing around my brain every day to discern what the actual cause of it was. 

I sit here now as an overweight, lazy, lonely, bitter person, and I only have myself to blame for it. I don't commit to getting better in any capacity, and even when I tried I let trivial things get to me and bring me back down. I feel so far behind the people I respect and who used to respect me, and I've been alone with these thoughts for my entire life.

I feel as though I have let my family, my friends, my colleagues and peers, and even myself down. It feels embarrassing to even be in the same room as them, let alone answer pleas for advice. What right do I have to give advice to others when I can't even figure out a single thing I want to do in my life?   
  
I know I have plenty of life left to live yet, but at this present moment I don't want to go through another day of monotonous self-loathing and continous reminders of all my mistakes and failures. I don't really know what to do from here, and as tempting as the 'end it all' option is, I am not the kind of person who would want to hurt anyone I love regardless of the place I am in mentally. So I'm just going to leave this here, hopefully as an acknowledgement of where I am at now and as a plea to tomorrow's me to start trying to salvage what I can.

I don't want to die, death scares me. I just feel so desperate that this is what my brain defaults to. I don't want to make a mistake I'll regret. I don't want to end up surviving. day to day, sometimes even minute to minute, my stance on this changes so drastically for whatever reason. today, I woke up and it didn't take long for me to be panicked by how deep I've been in my depression. but at the same time, I also feel panicked and desperate about my situation so I'm just in this limbo.

so with that said, genuinely, if I should live, then how do I actually do that? how can I actually press on? please help.

""My brother (18) died 8 weeks ago. He commited suicide. I spoke to him on the phone 9 hours before. My mother told me about him talking about only living for 2 more days, and I completely brushed it off, because he was talking things like that for years. After that I spoke with my brother on the telephone and he sounded sad, I think he was crying a little bit. I was asking him questions about how he feels, he told me he is feeling like he doesn't want to do anything and that nothing makes him happy. I asked him if he was depressed and he sad no. I than asked him to go to holidays with me, which he refused. I asked if there is anything I could do for him. But besides that I didnt offer any comfort, I didnt feel his pain. It was like I was for some reason mad at him. I ended the conversation after 11 minutes, because I didnt feel like talking to him. I was distant and cold. He had an doctors appointment a couple of hours later and I told him to tell the doctor about his feelings (that nothing makes him happy). I wasn't really concerned. For me it was just one of the many problems he had, we talked about them and it was later OK. I had a feeling that he might be depressed, I thought that this is something we still have a lot of time to solve. It didn't accour to me, that he might be suicidal for one second. I couldn't imagine that something like what happend, could happen in a million years. Later in the afternoon I was thinking that I have to call him and ask him how did the doctors appointment go, but when I remembered in the evening, it was already to late.

I feel guilty about not taking him talking about 2 more days, seriously. I feel guilty about thinking that everything will be alright and that it didnt occour to me that he might me suicidal. I feel guility that I was a bitch in the conversation. And I feel guilty about forgetting to call him.

He probably felt lonely his last days, and than even I dissapointed him. I feel like I humilieted him. I cant imagine his pain.""",1755091685.0,1,6,SuicideWatch,suicide

I have a plan beyond just walking into the wilderness but I'm not going to share it here. I simply don't want to be found ever and where I'm going it's unlikely I will be. Wildlife will likely dispose of me long before anyone shows up. 

It's been a wild ride but now I'm ready to get off, maybe the next time around I will be stronger, I will be smarter and I will make it through to the end of the game.  No matter what I doubt I will remember this time around and with luck I will simply slip away into nothingness.

The world I lived in is what drove me here. The people I've encountered is what gave this final ride fuel. It's a sad world we live in, the evil that lives in people. 

I can only assume that I am the problem, as it doesn't matter where I go or what I do this evil finds me.  It hunts me like no other and it feeds off the pain it causes. Making the most logical answer stop it, to remove the problem.

My dream has always been to go to med school to be a surgeon but with how I shut down any time a job is mentioned I'll never even get close. I'm taking time off between undergrad and med school to work a job and get clinical experience and truly honestly it feels like I'm never ever going to get to where I want to. And even when I get there I'm so so scared it's not going to be what I want. I'm so exhausted, I'm so useless, I don't have the energy to do anything but get out of bed and lay around on the couch in my parent's house all day before just going to sleep again, I'm so worthless and it really feels like nobody would care if I died. At least...not after a few months...but still everyone would get over it. I'm so tired, I'm so done, I'm so...nothing. Why does it matter if I kill myself?? I wish there was a way to eliminate my debt and then just die. Military maybe? Then at least I won't get pinned as a suicide and my parents are left with no debt.

God why am I even considering this I really genuinely desperately want to end it all. I'll never be able to make it in the medical field. I'll never be able to do anything.

1moz5qx,Losing the love of my life,"Hi, I am F25 living in Europe and i am starting to think of suicide again. I come from a very unstable family, controlling father that could never get his shit straight, controlling through fear but absent and in spite of this a very respected member in society because he is a caring and skilled doctor. A mom with mental issues(probably a post natal depression that was never addressed ) that instead of getting help or my father, a physician, helping her was left for me to take care of and manage ( if you ask her she will never admit it). 
At 15 i started getting sick, not the kind of sick that you will die from, the kind of sick that makes you wake up with all your joints on fire and cant get out of bed, 10 years later i still don’t have a diagnosis. My father the doctor? Oh he would order a blood test for me,confirm to me oh yeah they don’t look good and then… nothing.  And on top of everything i was depressed, i don’t ever remember i time i wasnt even in childhood
With all of the issues a could manage living and i did a pretty good job i think. Then senior year of high-school came, i was bullied before but it got worse, i had my final exam, trying to get my drivers license and the cherry on top pass entrance exam for med school. The thing is seeing my dad being  a doctor made me want it less. 
Passed my final high school exam with good grades, failed my license aaaand didn’t get into med school. You would think you didnt get in so you found a new path. Wrong, i was not allowed to. Stayed one year home with tutoring failed, tried to pass the exam at a uni that was easier to get into failed, enrolled into a biochemistry degree because the subjects thought in first year were what i needed for my med school exam. Did a good job at uni but in didnt study for my exam so i failed again. You are probably thinking surely now you looked for something else, i tried but my dad had other plans for me. 
He enrolled me without my knowledge in a med school in a foreign country. I was a good daughter and went. Managed to pass the first year but my depression got worse and with my pains and probably a new found anxiety i got stuck in bed for 3 months in my second year and got expelled. Told my father when he came to visit i cant do this i want to go home. That is the last time i saw him, 3 years ago. 
I go home to my moms, they have been separated but together with no divorce since i was 12, and i look for what i want to do in life, i want to help people so I chose psychology without telling my father. He was still supporting me at this point. Did a year of uni, i was finally happy, i found my people and outside of uni found the most amazing man, a blessing. 
Then my dad stopped paying rent for me and my mom, stoped sending me money for food. But he didnt tell me he wont be paying rent, one day i have the owner at my door ready to kick me out because my dad didn’t pay rent for the past 2 mo and couldn’t be reached. I couldn’t reach him either, for months now. I get a work from home job and let him know about it and that i am ok, he goes ahead and cancels the internet service to where i live so i cant go to work. I try to reach him again but never heard from him since. 
It has been a year, failed my second year at uni because i had classes during my work hours. Moved in with my boyfriend and because he owns his apartment i could I could work just part time so I could focus on my dream. We had plans for a life together, we love and understand each other. I felt like i could do this for the first time in my life. But then he tells me last night he will most probably leave. But not because he doesn’t love me or that things are not working. His job makes his life a living hell, he works 12h a day only 8 paid and no overtime pay, 6 days a week, didn’t take a sick day in 3years. That would be bearable if his boss wouldn’t be a jerk that drives all good employees out. 
So he is going back to his home town,there is a job crisis nothing for him here. I will have to go back to my moms. 
I can’t a cant go back to being an object to fulfil other people’s dreams, i am tired of struggling, tired if not feeling wanted, tired of being scared, controlled. I am planing to let him leave and kill myself. I cant go backwards and be miserable again at this point in my life i cant survive again that environment, I probably won’t finish uni, losing the man i love, there is nothing here for me left. Thank you if you read my saga, probably not an easy one to go through. I wanted to give as much context as possible but there is still a lot i left out. I just cant get up anymore, struggle and push through just for the ground under my feet to disappear. Most probably i will go through with this, he is leaving in two weeks. Again thank you for reading my struggle and hope you are well.

1mosjcm,I won't kill myself.,"i'll probably delete this soon but i grew up in a life full of trauma whatever the whole shabang. sexual abuse physical abuse emotional abuse it doesnt matter.

i wasnt always a high functioning indiviual, i got diagnosed with schizophrenia in early middle school (genetics, thanks mom!) and throughout my whole middle school career to early freshman i was severely depressed and struggling with awful mental health lol and a shitty boyfriend. whatever. i got ""better"" i guess. physically my health got worse, i had to quit track and tennis and be on the sidelines for my favorite sport karate. i was so miserable despite graduating valedictorian, i had the perfect life and yet all i wanted to do was end it. 

near the end of that year, i guess maybe may? june? someone really close to me said something that really affected me, id had been emotionally stable, or doing better for a long time and i just broke, i was so tired. i didnt expect that from this person and i was so heartbroken, really, really heartbroken. id had lost a few friends at that time, sexually assaulted by one even. i broke into pieces, i stopped eating completely and hyperfixated on the number on the scale. i probably cut myself more than 100 times in that one summer alone. shortly after in october of this year, i would take my meds inconsistently because i was so depressed and i was so lost and losing time. i went to college last year at a really good school. i wasnt really happy. i mean, i was. i made amazing friends, but it felt like bad experiences kept following me. i was drinking and cutting and i hated myself so bad.

i attempted suicide and it physically and emotionally debilitated me, im really proud of myself for being on the up. really, im a lot better. theres no universe where i slack off my meds or be so self destructive again. i woke up and id draw people who kept me alive as one of my exercises. now all i need to do is look in the mirror. i know the most important person in my life now is me and she deserves so much better than me slicing her silly and calling her rude names. its so hard for me to believe people would even cry at my funeral. i hurt so many people. i scared them. and now im starting at a new school, i lost half my freshman year of college to the hospital and im terrified, i passed, but i know i couldve done so much better. i feel like such a disappointment of a friend, sister, girlfriend. it takes everything in me, all the willpower in the world to not throw up my meals and bed rot but i dont, i go to therapy and i take my meds and i eat whole meals.

im so worried people are gonna know think im a freak. some girl so sad she fantasizes about dying, i always wanted to be a normal girl and i feel so robbed of that. its not fair, its not fair at all because im in so much pain and i have to keep going. i want too, even, its just, really, really hard. i try to smile at the reflection insread of cower. i want to be better, i want to be okay, and im going to work really hard for it. im going to prove everyone wrong. im gonna prove ME wrong and keep going.",1755052274.0,3,3,SuicideWatch,suicide

1mojlm4,"[Not Urgent] I won't live forever, so I'd rather choose my time","So I'm not ACTIVELY suicidal right now, but it seems like the way to go. 


My mother has early-onset dementia (at 46), and it's really heightened my thoughts on this. She saved for retirement and planned her life to still be working for another 20 years, to just get told ""well that's over"" and now (2 years later at 48) she's on disability, can't hold anything above basic conversations, has a hard time eating, and can't do a lot of fun things like traveling without forgetting where she is and having a really hard time


What I'm ""supposed to do"": save money my whole working life (18-65) to then retire at 65 when I'm too old/in pain to actually enjoy lots of things. Then die like from some painful old-age condition

OR I end up getting an illness/disease etc. that kills me/effectively ends my life early and now I can't do fun while young/healthy OR retire

My thought process instead: live/spend how I want until I don't feel like it anymore. I get to enjoy life on my terms, still saving for emergencies, but not acting like I need to have $2M for old age


I'm asexual/aromantic and don't want kids, which get rid of a lot of the ""long-term"" things people want out of life. I don't have any friends either, just hanging out with my family, coworkers, and clubs I'm in. I think I'll enjoy a couple decades (maybe) and then I'll end it eventually. The rules of life change so much and, at some point, I anticipate I may not want to learn/adapt anymore. I could also get bored I guess


I guess, has anyone else thought like this? Like, I'm not going to kill myself now or soon, but I probably will eventually. Life has to end at some point, so I'd rather do it myself on my terms while I'm still truly living. I shouldn't have to want to do this forever/until it gets ripped from me by happenstance.",1755029613.0,10,12,SuicideWatch,suicide

1mowf05,I think I’m experiencing ego death while going through depression,"I feel like I’m going through ego death while going through my current worst stage of depression. This will sound dumb, but let me explain. I play a game called Marvel Rivals and I thought this was the online multiplayer game I was finally good at. Well as the game goes on I feel I’m getting worse. I want to blame teammates for not winning very much, but I’m also told that I just need to get better so I can get out of my placement rank in the game. But no matter what I try and do differently, I’m not rising in rank. So here comes what I think is ego death. I thought I finally found a game I was good at and now I’m learning I’m just not good at any games. And yes it sounds silly, but to be honest I feel this way about everything! I can’t seem to find something I enjoy anymore or be good at anything. I feel like a loser. I don’t have a job, a drivers license, or really any goals. I can make excuses all I want with stuff like having bad feet, anxiety and autism, but there are other people with these problems and working and driving. I also used to think I was decently smart. Up until earlier yesterday, I was typing a message and I meant to say fill, but typed feel instead. And I do this kind of often.

And he said he won't bring her here while I'm home. That's all he can offer. I have to die to get away from her presence in his life.

She can't walk one mile; she makes him drive out there to drive her a mile down the road and then sends him home.

If I don't distract myself even for a slight moment not only do I get visions and thoughts suicide but I also think about certain things and it makes my body react in various way and I end up crying. Please I don't know what to do.

1mocd6f,Alone in the world,"Every time I come to this subreddit, I feel so sad. How can there be a world where someone is right next to you, suffering, sad, and moaning, and no one can hear them because they're preoccupied with some triviality? No one asks for a ten-hour conversation. Sometimes people just want to be noticed and heard. But that's not what happens; people pass by you like a stray dog. What people don't know or don't want to know is that a two-minute conversation or a phone call can save a life. But they don't matter. The worst part is that not only do your friends not care, but your family does. Being ignored by your family is the worst thing. Everyone walks past you at home day and night, eats at the same table, and no one cares. For example, when I became depressed and locked myself in my room, no friend called to ask if I was okay. Most people just want something from you. My best friend, even knowing I was depressed, asked me to borrow money. I did. I took what was left of my money and gave it to him. He never called me again. After he stopped contacting me, I searched his social media. I checked his Facebook. He was there, using drugs and drinking beer. He wasn't just a friend, but almost a brother. We grew up together, since we were little. He played video games at my house, had lunch at my house, etc. People just want to benefit, take advantage, and drain you until you have nothing left. Few people will help us. Most don't care or don't see anything.



The reality is this: No one cares until the worst happens. At the end of the movie (spoiler alert) Tenet, a character says: ""No one cares about the bomb that didn't explode."" People only care when the worst happens.



I confess I'm about to give up. I want to not give up, I ask everyone not to give up either. But I'm already out of strength to continue. I don't know what will happen from now on.

I’m 28 now, and I just… don’t know if all this fight was worth it. I’m still traumatised, still depressed, still anxious. A decade of therapy, and eh, I’ve just more come to terms with going through the motions of life.

I have a partner, and pets, and friends (although they all are only friends with me due to my partner), a house, a job. I know this should all help, but it just… doesnt. I’ve accomplished a lot, but life feels hollow. 

Medication all had awful side effects, and even then all I really felt was that the constant “please I want to die” monologue got quieter - I never actually got to a point of wanting to live. I’ve never been all that averse to being run over. 

I’m just tired, and I wish euthanasia was both legal and socially accepted. I’m only alive because it would inconvenience others, and because if I wake up from an attempt I would be labelled crazy and lose everything (partner would for sure leave, I don’t blame him, and with him would go most of my social network).

Was was mock fighting with my younger nephew, it was hot as fuck like 44°c and one led to another but I almost drowned due to my weakness and had to get cpr from my granddad (this was in a public Pool btw.) But the reason why we talked about it is because my mom fucking posted this to Facebook at the time with my name on it, so grandma and I continued to talk as she said ""Well when my neighbours asked me why I didn't do some things like driving a screw, I knew that you were wekker then me."" And she didn't mean it bad ofcourse. But it made me think, that even when I was 15 my grandma who was battling cancer and was 79 years old was stronger then I am. 

It made me realise that I'm a waste of seed, I'm a weak guy way weaker then the average guy is, I'm weak in mind, I'm not capable of much and I fucked up my post-highschool studies. I was taken away by CPS at 13 and I'm even to dumb to do my finances and to make good life decisions.

1mo8ud0,Chronic pain and lack of purpose,"Background: Female, 55, partnered but not married (5 years), no children, we share a dog. I have multiple (non cancerous) brain tumours and have had major surgeries and radiation that's caused me to suffer 12 years of chronic migraines. I also have major child abuse in my background which makes brain resilience more challenging. It's unclear at this time if my major depression is caused in by the physical realities of my brain.

After a 30 year career in marketing, I haven't worked in almost 2 years. Fired from my last job due to lateness (I usually have my migraines upon waking). I've lost most of my friendships over the years as people get tired of me cancelling on them.

Between the lack of income and lack of something to do, I feel useless. What do I contribute, really?

That's pretty much it. I'm in pain most days, can't work, and don't really know what is the point of a life like this. My partner tells me I'm not a burden, but of course that can't really be true. I can't help but think his life would be better in the long run. I would do all I could to minimize the trauma he'd experience. He could replace me with someone healthy, and the life insurance would clear his mortgage.

1moc66d,Why am I even living. Just to suffer,"I already tried everything to off myself. Hanging, almost drinking chlorine, I even mutilated my mom's dumbcane plant to extract its juice to inflame my throat so that I can finally die. I did all my research on how, but why does my body respond differently?

Like from the time I almost drank bleach, I could still remember the horrid, sour, and burning taste of the chemical entering my mouth. But there's a part in my throat (probably my esophagus) that's blocked and made me cough since I can no longer handle the taste. My parents were away at that time so they didn't know what happened to me and my severe suicidal thoughts.

Why am I still alive though? It's as if my body doesn't have the balls to do it and finally end my eternal suffering that I've endured for 18 years. I feel empty while writing this post and I hope that there is someone out there suffering the same fate as mine.

I never really wanted to be born, to be honest, but our parents always said these words to us as if it was our fault that we even existed in the first place. These past years have been traumatizing and I could only lean on playing online games to keep myself sane. It gives me that particular 'high' that I want to achieve temporary happiness.

I told my parents about this problem 7 months ago, and my dad listened to me, but my mom's reaction was the opposite. She told me that I am just overreacting and it would be a waste of money if she takes me to a psychologist and gets help. She also said that people who come to a psychological clinic or hospital are those who are suffering from schizophrenia and other mental illnesses and need to be admitted to the hospital.

She told me that I am just faking my illness just to get more attention than my two younger siblings.

And it feels hurt being told that way by the person who gave birth to me. The same person who once looked at me with a smile on her face, calling me by my nickname.

Fast forward, weeks later when she said that, I left home. I told my dad that I'm going somewhere to work but I did not specify where it is. He thought that it was just a simple summer job since I mentioned once before that there was a job that I'm applying for in the city near my home. But to be honest? I went a thousand miles away from home. Like, from Davao del Norte to Davao del Sur is kind of far.

Today I live with my aunt and am currently working on a 9-5 BPO job. This is the first time I have finally tasted temporary freedom. But I am still plagued by the memories of my past. I wanna contemplate on whether to use my money to finally seek help from a professional, but I decided that it's no use and I might as well use this money to buy everything I wanted and live my life just in case truck-kun wants to isekai me and free me once and for all.",1755013295.0,2,1,SuicideWatch,suicide

1mo1j68,Suicidal GF,"Hey,

32m 29F

When I met her, while she had some mental health issues she seemed like it wasn’t all a big deal. 

We now live together and when things get rough or we have a fight she casually mentions how she wants to die. 

When she feels better she no longer holds that stance. 

Her life is not in a good place right now, she’s quite dependant on me financially, and her mental health has declined. 

She doesn’t seem to be making any meaningful effort toward improving herself rather she just distracts herself mostly. 

At the same time she’s got high standards for my behaviour and will reprimand me if I step out of line. 

I don’t think she’s a lost cause would love for her to seek help but she refuses. Ending the relationship might cause her to become homeless due to her crippling mental health issues. She mentioned she would refuse any financial aid if we end things. 

I am afraid if we break up that she will commit suicide. I am also afraid of talking about these issues openly with her because when she got depressed, she also mentioned wanting to end the relationship with me on account that she’s burdening me with her problems. 

She told me not to contact her parents about this as she would hate me and never talk to me again if I did. 

Therefore I feel alone, and lacking the courage to standup for what I believe is right due to my fear of her suicidal nature, I also love her. 

I wish I could tell her that if she doesn’t go to therapy atleast that I would end the relationship but I am afraid this could send her on a suicidal spiral. 

On top of all this I am emotional, anxious and have a stressful life and a demanding job.

I don’t believe it’s gotten so bad that she’s beyond help, I think that while it has gotten bad, it’s not there yet, please advise me regarding how I should move forward.

After 5 days I got watery stools for 1.5days. after that I taken medicine and it go away. I was very paranoid and started panicking and watching google and was panicking that I had HIV. After that my immunity gone and I am getting sweats and was panicking mouth sores not fever. I cannot tell my parents as I am 25 years old. I was very ashamed of what I had done. I don't want to go to testing as I am getting anxiety attacks daily. I am very fearful of getting positive.My soles and palms is getting sweats. I am getting night sweats and mouth sores as my symptoms. Plz help me anyone tell that I had HiV or not plzpzlzplz
Edit- yesterday I started getting burning sensation my penis and my panick starts again .It's been 1.5 months my update I had asked my partner he said that he had done with many person from last 10 years. I had fatigue and my immunity is also very low night sweats are there, ear and nose congestion, I had one or two swollen lymph nodes one in my armpit and one in my throat. I don't have fever but I had inflammation all in my body when I slept at night. I also had hyper inflammation in my body. I think I also had CKD as I am having dehydration and my urine is getting cloudy and the colour is yellow. My full body has pimple like blisters and my skin is gotten softer suppose if I go out in sun I will be drenched and my skin will get some white patches also . I also think I had diabites I mistakenly had cut from my nail in mouth and the wound is not healing. I also had bad itching when I sleep in night.I will get tested after another 1.5 months something 90 days. I don't know what will happen but if I get positive I think I will suicide because i cannot watch my parents as they had brought me up by so much pain and I don't want to give them pain anymore. I am from that place where this hiv and all still means dead. If my society people would know that I had hiv my parents will be thrown out of my society. They will think that I am gay. It will easy for me to suicide then tell my parents that I have HIV.i know it is manageable but in America there has been no discrimination in hospital for HIV positive or negetive but here in my country 90-95% doctors will deny and also same with hospitals also. If I sue them then they will expose my identity in public and then everyone knows. Same goes in office. I have 1.5 months more in my life enjoying life with my parents with this disease. I cannot lie with my parents. If I had hiv no one will marry me. In my country we generally have arranged marriage system and I cannot lie from my wife also if in future I get married. If my future wife know me I had hiv she will sue me and I will go to jail for I don't know how many years for forgery. I know someone will told me that I can marry an hiv positive woman.

Could jump of a building, but what if I change my mind? 

could jump in front of a train, but what if I survive. 

at this point I just think why not to medevial and find the most poisonous Berry or flower or plant in my country and toxic mixture.

There's no guns in my country 

I'm slowly starving myself to death for the past 2 years as my only way out. 


Why:
4 years ago someone lied to me, took everything i had, hurt me and my family and destroyed our lives and disfigured me and made me very sick, took all our money including what I needed for live saving quality of life surgery, and left me for dead. 

lost my career, ability to wash, watch TV, read, listen to anything, got brain damage, couldn't sleep for years, slept sitting up. 

edit: by ""not being able to sleep for years"" I mean 2-3 hours a night for years, sitting only too
Which didn't help heal the initial brain injury, or the later concussions. I don't even know how I can still think but I know that it all feels wrong to exist now and my perception for reality is now horrifying, and has felt ""wrong"" since. 

I trusted them because I'm autistic. 
I only just started living (got out of an abusive enviroment) 
I'm over 30 so there's no ""it gets better"", it was getting better, now it's been and is hell. I've had therapy. I used to find joy in the most mundane. I grew up without a home so even having a bath or vacuuming the floor I was grateful and happy, my autism helped me find joy in every tiny thing. 

so it's not like I don't know the joy of life, the problem is damaging my brain and health and body the way hhe did took that from m, and my loved ones, my family, everything. 

I haven't had a good day in 3 and a half years

I worked manual labor outside, jobs in factories, and eventually went back to school. I was working, living in my car, and attending class the the local community college at the same time. I ran out of money for school, swallowed my pride, and went back to working in a steel factory for $10/hour. 

Eventually, COVID gave me the financial means to finish my degree at a pretty good R1 university. I love urban planning and architecture but went into applied math (which I also do love) because it seemed safer. Graduated with honors in 3.5 years, did an internship in machine learning at a major national lab, thought I was going to finally have a life I could be comfortable in.

2.5 years later, and the only job offer I've had was for a government position (an amazing one, no less) that I for some nebulous reason didn't pass the clearance for. After about a year I got desperate and have been applying to things way below software engineering/machine learning, data science, etc. I've applied to jobs managing accounts, as a technical writer, in IT, bartending, wind turbine maintenance. Nothing. Even to start an electrician apprenticeship here is over half a year wait. 

I've made some mistakes, trusted people I shouldn't have, and certainly not been perfect. But goddamn do I feel like I've been above average.

1mof7ef,No reason to back down,"So hear me out, I'll try to make it short. Knowing myself I probably won't but if you manage to take the time to read it all it will mean a lot. I jus twant to share my weird POV.

&nbsp;

I've had a shitty childhood and was an absolute cunt myself. I do blame my parents but I also feel absolutely awful as to how terrible I was myself, and is a great source of anxiety.

I have not gone any better growing up and have alienated myself from absolutely everyone. I have no-one in my life. Last time I was intimate with someone was 8 years ago, and I have no friendly relationship with anyone including family or work.

To counter that, I've thrown myself hopelessly into work. I'm not a workaholic however I have worked more 15h shifts than a med school student, up to 7 days weeks for 3 month straight. I just wanted to accomplish something. Yet I could hardly last more than a year at each job due to being insufferable. 

I was sacked by text as I was passing security in an airport as I just moved in and bought a car there. At the 7days week job where I stopped counting weekly hours after I reached 100, my boss threw down a fist fight accusing me of stealing (I wasn't). Anywho, details.

Latest in date is my current job that I fell in love with, I have been there for 7 years. The dream job. As usual, I worked harder than anyone in the building and had zero work life balance. None. I never asked for a raise or anything. I built a team and fought for them every day, yet the second I have one single problem in 7 years, I was not even given a 5 min chat. A 1 minute chat. I was in fact avoided and ghosted. I had enough and took a medical leave without notice, and the first day I didn't turn up I received only one message: ""are you off today?"". That's it. Not ""are you okay"". This was the one and only message I got from my supervisor after me not coming to work from 7 years of zero sick leave.

So here's my point, what's the point in keeping going? I have been thinking about for many years actually but now I don't see any point in keeping going. At all. 

Looking ahead, whether it be personally, regarding family, or society in general, all 3 really have nauseating future prospects that I really don't want to be part of. I just don't give a shit anymore, about anything. I have no reason to. And I think that's fine.

I  heard Bill Burr say recently that you spend the first 40 years collecting people, and the 2nd losing them. Well I'm turning 39, and have achieved absolutely nothing at all. No job gives a shit about me, and no human either. I've just reached the end of my rope, the end of my purpose on this planet. And I'm at peace with it. Sure it sucks, but I've given it my all, and reached nowhere. I'm done. I'm ready.

&nbsp;

If you've made it that far, thank you very much. Feel free to tell me how wrong I am/downvote/report me if you feel like it. However if you want to tell me that I was wrong for working so much for free without asking for raises or whatever, you can save your time as it will otherwise be wasted.",1755019977.0,1,6,SuicideWatch,suicide
1mo44q0,I'm going to kill myself soon,"Every day is the same in this hell 

I'm losing track of the days, for me holidays, special dates, weekends are all the same. I just have to work.  On my birthday I have to celebrate alone, and what's the point? Eat a cake (about 30 minutes) and then empty... go back to work so you don't sit still, lying down

I'm living like a zombie, I wake up, train, eat, work, study and sleep

Other than that there's nothing else for me to do 

Weekend? I have to choose between staying home alone, going out alone and being bored, or working

And this excess productivity destroyed me, not because it was bad

But because outside of that there is nothing to sustain me

I can't connect with people, I always suffer rejection since childhood, yes, I have changed many aspects and that's not the case, it's my soul.

I no longer have dreams, faith, religion, hobbies, anything.
I rationalized everything, nothing is worth it to continue tomorrow 

And what makes everything worse is that despite wanting to die all the time, I still continue taking care of myself, taking care of my health, being productive, and this shit will only make me live longer in this cycle

Continuing now makes no sense

It's not like tomorrow I'm going to discover something I like and be happy with it, I already know it's temporary and it'll just be a distraction 

But on the other hand, I could have an accident at work and have to deal with more bad things.


What's the point of a life like this, where bad things come every day, daily stress, and nothing good remains or lasts even a little bit?

I have nothing else to do in this damn world

I have nothing left to build or follow, now it's just repetition and boredom.

If I could feel happy with a mediocre life, that would be great. 

But since even that doesn't do me any good, all I have left is this limbo of being different, I'm going to accept it and end this useless cycle once and for all.",1754991295.0,5,0,SuicideWatch,suicide
1mo0jap,I don’t enjoy living and don’t think I ever will,"This is my first ever Reddit post.  Just downloaded today.  Was hoping to find some people I could relate to.

Time for the trauma dumping!

I’m 18.  I’ve wanted to die for three years.  I’ve had anxiety and low self esteem for much longer.  For whatever reason, when I was almost 15, my mother became much more abusive.  She had never been gentle, but I considered it a rite of passage in our culture.  She is an immigrant.  (I know now this is wrong.  Culture or not, abuse is abuse.). My father and older sibling were rarely around when this happened.  I was trapped with her.  I started dissociating and fantasizing about killing myself.  I was very good in school and on track to graduate early and go to college, with my parents paying for it.  I never reported to CPS because I was scared of destroying my family and losing my future.  I withdrew from my friends.  The most present person was a sketchy dude I knew was trouble.  It was summer when this started.  The first and only remotely healthy relationship I’ve had ended towards the beginning of the summer.  Later, the sketchy guy and I were considering adding benefits to our friendship.  We never ended up doing anything.

The school year came around.  Being forced to be back with my good friends and spending less time with my mother, I felt better.  I tried to cut the guy out.  He guilt tripped me into hanging out with him and assaulted me on school grounds.  I didn’t tell anyone or even think about it for days.  He spread rumors that we slept together that reached administration.  They didn’t listen to me and we were both suspended.  My mother wouldn’t have that and hired an attorney.  I had to tell my story again and again, often in front of my parents.  My dad and my sister gave me space.  My mother shamed me when they weren’t around.  She continued to verbally and physically attack me, making up stories to my dad that I was violent and out of control.  Over time, she drove a wedge between my family and me.  I’m still disconnected from them.  They’re not the best people, anyway.

I survived until college.  I wanted to go into a field that would help the world.  It was the only reason I stayed alive.  I thought I could go be successful and happy.  I failed.  I can’t do it.  I’m working in food/customer service now.  It’s fun and I like my boss, but of course it isn’t fulfilling.  I’m not important to the world.  There is no reason for me to be here.  My family constantly reminds me what a freak and a failure I am.  My friends from school are happy and successful without me.  Not a soul on this planet needs me.  I could die without guilt.  I think about it every day.

I’ve had plenty of great experiences, achievements, and happy moments in the past few years.  None of it makes me glad I stayed alive.  There is nothing I look forward to more than death.

I haven’t been able to make new friends in years.  I’ve only had relationships that were toxic on both sides.  I hurt people, people hurt me.  I guess I want love, but nobody can give me the care I need and I know I’ll only ruin it.

Some part of me still hopes I can be important, do something with my life.  Maybe I can if I try hard enough, but I don’t really want to.

TLDR; I’m a failure and I want to die.  Wow.",1754977554.0,8,1,SuicideWatch,suicide

1mody0l,my life is a complete mess,"Hi, I'm hoping to find someone to talk to. The title sums up my life right now... a complete disaster... I'll be brief but what happened is that 2/3 years ago I started having a lot of chronic and very serious health problems for my age (19) which led me to suffer more and more and to choose tears as a way to vent. I also underwent a very expensive invasive surgery but nothing has changed. I spend a lot of money on my health problems and I can no longer study, eat, do anything. I have a boyfriend but he treats me really badly, I'm always afraid of being the wrong person and maybe I am, both for him and for my parents, who insult me whatever I do.  These days, my boyfriend has been ignoring the fact that I'm really sick. I often tell him I want to kill myself, that I can't live anymore, but he pretends nothing's happening. In fact, he usually isolates himself, and I start having fits and cry, I cry so much. The other day I attempted suicide. In an attempt to stop me, he knocked me down, and now I have a bruised knee. He refused to go out and buy me medicine. Furthermore, for a long time, my boyfriend offered to give me part of his salary to go for checkups and tests to try to get better. From today, he told me he no longer wants to give it to me and won't tell me why. My parents can't pay for it.  I don't think I'm a perfect person, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but now... I think the people around me are really punishing me more than they should be... and I really want to die... I wish someone cared about me, but both the people who ""created"" me and my boyfriend seem to treat me with contempt... I really don't know what to do anymore...

I don’t even know if anyone is going to care or give any sympathy, but here goes…

Recently my little cousin died and I’ve been a wreck over it. Everything hurts and I really want to kill myself.
She was hit in the abdomen by a metal fucking swing at a playground, her ribs shattered, her liver ruptured and she suffered internal bleeding. She was just 9 years old.
She was my reason on moving forward, to keep living. My only semblance of innocence and purity after I had been groomed by a disgusting pedophile in 2023 while I was 16. I was just about to view children normally again, but then she had to die. She’s gone. She’s fucking gone.
Everything hurts. It hurts so fucking bad.
I can only think of cutting myself, that’s my only way of coping. I don’t know how else to cope because whenever I vent I basically get punished, I don’t trust people, I don’t have enough friends and none of my friends are nearby right now.
I kind of really truly super want to die rn…
I lost my bsf of 15 years as well because she didn’t even want to comfort me. I understand her family that she barely sees was coming over, but I was legit asking her if she could meet me AFTERRRRRR and also she had to make it about herself as if I didn’t just lose my little cousin….

My dad has afib and has battled with heart issues his entire life, his side of the family also struggles, his little brother died due to a shit heart, his aunt dropped dead due to a shit heart during dinner... yet he fucking proceeded to pass this shit genes onto me.

You can hate me for saying that, whatever but when it's you being robbed of your youth, being robbed of everything you've ever wanted because you can't even fucking stand without testing such a vital organ, I bet you'd feel differently. I hate that I was born.

There's no such thing as it getting better for me, either I die now or I die later from some excruciating stroke, heart attack, or some other bullshit.

There should be a suicide button for someone like me.

If I don't figure out another way i'm going to overdose on all my medications, I hope that's not too bad.. if my heart is shit maybe i won't live long enough to experience all the bad side effects. I mean I can't even handle heat or standing. I never wanted this, ironically enough i wanted to be a doctor, i wanted to have kids but if my body seemingly wants to give up the second I do anything other than lay down and sometimes even walk how the fuck can my body somehow carry a child too? my realization that i wanted to become a mother has come just in time for my realization that i don't want to fucking live anymore, especially if i can't have children, especially if i try it'll probably kill us both. 

Plus, i won't have children regardless, my biggest love to them, my biggest mercy to them is that i won't pass these shit genes to them.

1mo0yiq,How do I get my therapist to help me?,"I know this sounds like a strange question, because a therapists job is to help their clients, but I just can’t seem to get the help I need and I am not sure what I am doing wrong.

I’ve been seeing my therapist for several months now. I started seeing her specifically because she is a trauma therapist who has experience working with those with suicidal ideation. I have been struggling a lot and I desperately need help.

In the past I have really struggled to open up to previous therapists and tell them what’s really going on, I have a hard time trusting and feeling safe. With this new therapist I promised myself I was going to open up to her and really share my thoughts and feelings and past trauma.

I feel like I tell her every week I am in crisis and feel like I am about to break. I tell her about my suicidal thoughts and feelings and she just sits there in silence. She never asks about plan or means or intent. She never asks me any questions. I just sit there and spill my heart, and it’s like I’m talking to a brick wall.

I’ve even gone as far as being very direct with her and telling her I need more support and I need her to help me keep myself safe. She always thanks me for being open and tells me she will offer more support, but she never follows through, she never offers any suggestions or guidance or feedback. It’s almost like she doesn’t believe I’m really in crisis or that the situation is not as serious as I say.

I just don’t know what to do. I live in a rural area and there aren’t really any other options for therapists who specialize in trauma so it’s not like I can just find someone else.

I don’t know what to do. I want to live but I know I need help. What can I say to her to get her to take me seriously?",1754979035.0,4,1,SuicideWatch,suicide

It’s so disturbing that my mind operates this way but I sometimes want to KMS just so they can feel bad for what they did to me. Is this because i have a victim mentality/victim complex? I grew up in a household where I was *never* able to be the victim in *any* situation. 

I grew up with really shitty parents. untreated BPD mom and narcissistic dad. Psychotic older brother. Me being the youngest in the family, i always felt so fucking hopeless, helpless and powerless being surrounded by these type of people.

They can verbally, emotionally and physically abuse me but the moment I cry or show *any* reaction/emotion, i’m the crazy bitch in their eyes. Me crying always made them even more angry, its like me being hurt by their abuse triggered them. 

Clearly everyone in my household is just fucked in the head and it only left me feeling desperate to be treated like the victim for once. 

“Are you okay?” “I’m sorry.” ….. is all i wanted to ever hear. Now i’m constantly in a state of mind where i’m just like “I bet they’ll only realize it once i KMS” “This is the only way they’ll feel bad for me.” I’m *that* desperate for sympathy. empathy. for someone to actually feel bad for me.

Throwaway. My wife cheated on me. What's frustrating about the whole thing is that the marriage ending was my fault but I've been actively trying to make up for it. She says that she can see that I'm trying and it hurts that I'm at this point but won't do anything to console me or reassure me that everything is not the end of the world. Instead she's found comfort in a man who she's known for 15 years and is actively being flirted with by this dude. 

Wanting to defend my wife even though I don't have any reason to anymore, he calls me childish, and my wife agrees with him. I just don't want to live anymore. Yes we have a son together and he's the light of my life but when I married my wife I signed up for the package deal, not being divorced at age 32 with nowhere to go. Then because where I live is not an at fault state I don't get say in custody and I'll have to go through the legal system which is unfortunately biased towards women and because I'm autistic they're probably never going to give me custody of my son. Part of me just wants to die now so that I can fulfil the vow I made. Till death do us part. That's what I signed up for.

Not this.

I'm genuinely considering flying to another country to get euthanasia done. At least they would be more willing for someone with a mental disorder that can never be cured and has suffered so much that he just wants to die and give him what he wants. I'm never going to grow old with her, my son will probably hear some sort of bullshit reason as to why we divorced and he'll hate me.

1mnwo2u,Up and down emotional roller coaster,"I’m struggling to find solid ground in my life right now. Every day feels like a relentless roller coaster that I can’t get off. Some moments I genuinely love life and appreciate the little things, and the people and other lives that I care about. But then the next moment I’m overwhelmed with crushing depression, ready to give up, and i become impulsive to the point of harming myself. The shift is so fast and intense that I barely have time to process the emotions. This back and forth happens daily . It’s exhausting and confusing. It makes it almost impossible to trust my own feelings or decisions. To cope, ive been abusing depressants and trying to quiet the chaos and numb the pain. But it ends up trapping me deeper in confusion and hopelessness, and further making me emotionally unstable. I just want to feel normal for one day. I don’t know how to stop this cycle or even where to start asking for help. If anyone else has felt like this or has advice on how to hold on when your mind won’t let you, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

I still miss her so damn much and I can barely look at photos of her without either sobbing or forcing myself to be okay while feeling the emptiest I’ve ever felt.
I want to cut into my stomach and ribs. Selfharm is the only coping strategy I have and I really do want to cut into my fat and hit my fascia. 
Sometimes I cut for fun, maybe even for pleasure because it’s an addiction. I started when I was 9 years old and ever since then it’s only gotten more extreme. First being like a cat scratch, then I would his the second layer where it’s white and then I would go deep until I saw yellow fat which is all I do now because it’s the only thing that makes me feel better.
I want to cut where she got hit. I want to cut my genitals to forget where I was touched without my consent. I want to slice up my thighs to hide my groomer’s name.
There’s a lot I’m spewing out right now, but that’s just because the whole world is crashing down on me right now. I’ve been going through hell this year although I thought it would get better. I know this is stupid but posting on here (lol and Im posting again here) made me feel worse and it’s making me want to cut myself again.
I feel like I’m being pushed over the edge
I lost many friends last year because they thought I was too much. I was involved in a police case that had to do with my groomer that forced me to pee and vomit on cam, carve his online name on my thighs, and ageplay … there is more but I hate the carving the most.
I want to skin my upper thighs. Just get rid of it. No amount of laser therapy can ever help this. I had to show them the evidence which triggered me.
After that I got involved with some guy just for him to discard me after having sex and pushing his trauma onto me, stonewalling me like I’m nothing. People blatantly ignoring the fact that I’ve been suicidal and am actively attempting it. I slit my throat on my 18th birthday and had to spend it in a damn hospital. I felt so alone and I still do.
And now.. this. My cousin.
It feels like nothing is worth fighting for anymore. Not art. Not hobbies. Nothing. I dont feel like getting out of bed much and Im not excited to go back to school when I’m really going to just be an empty shell of myself dressed in pretty clothes to look aesthetically pleasing.

She’s tried to sustain her own business but it took a hit after COVID. Shes also doing Uber but she’s confessed to me that it’s only cause she knows she can’t kill other and when she’s driving alone waiting for her next ride, she thinks sbout driving off a cliff.

she came out to be as suicidal in January. Before then, she never told me but she’d given me glimpses into it like saying she had “something she wanted to tell my brother and i but couldn’t yet”

After she told me (not my brother cause he was still in high school and she wanted him focus on school without worrying him) i broke down to my uncle and he kind of helped, but he’s in Tennessee rn and can’t do much currently

Today my mom broke down to me again. She said she feels like she’s done her job of getting my brother and i to adulthood and that she’s tired. I could only really say “i know” and “what you’re saying is valid but please don’t be rash”

She told me she tried to commit suicide when she was in her twenties but it failed. And my dad made her feel isolated and was manipulative. He’s out of our lives but still haunts her cause she hasn’t changed her phone number 

She’s been seeing a therapist at 4 AM almost every Sunday for about six seven months now. But he isn’t always able to get back to her cause she’s in Spain

she cried to me how she feels pathetic and worthless for being broke at her age and having no real job, since she never got a college degree (I didn’t know this until today). apparently she dropped out a year before graduating because she was so stressed taking care of my dads three kids from his first marriage (my step siblings hate our dad too. I love them and they grateful to my mom). she was so stressed, she said. she’s been working nonstop since she was 14. she said she feels terrible for asking me for money constantly and hates how I brush off giving her my money with “it’s okay” and stuff like that, even though I am fine with it. I want my mom to be able to retire. I don’t want her to keep dipping into her meager savings. It hurts seeing her like this.

1mnvach,I am going to kill myself on my birthday. Please someone help me.,"(19 FTM)

I live in a never ending cycle. It feels like groundhog day. The only actions I take are thinking my stupid thoughts, going to work, rotting in bed, dreaming of a better life, talking with family, going out to get groceries. Like a hamster in a improper cage- living for nothing but to live more in a tiny cage with nothing to do, living for the will of my hypothetical owner, having no new experiences or anything to make live worth living.

But, even if I get my golden ticket, even if I'm given a chance, I know I'll fuck it up and- even if i don't- what if there is nothing better to wait for? Sure, I'm gonna go on testosterone, but what if it's not what I'm expecting or it's not enough to save me?? What if there is nothing special I'm waiting for? What if I just get moved to a slighter larger cage? 

I'm starting to feel that there is nothing to live for. I have nothing I love except for fictional characters, and I can never talk to them. My family cares about me in some sense, but I know that they don't care about me as a man. They are going to bury me in a dress, no matter what I say. I guess I won't be there to care.

But I don't want to be a statistic, as much as I can't stand living. I won't be there to care, but I don't want to hurt my sister or my community. I fear I have no choice.

If I don't feel better by august 13 (my birthday) I am going to end it all. I will try a lot of different things to make me hopefully see that life is worth living, but if none of them work, it's the end for me. I'm gonna really try, I promise.

I have a little brother whos twelve, a mother who's five months pregnant, an aunt who's like a sister to me. I have two best friends, i have online friends, and yet i don't feel the empathy i used to when i had these thoughts before. I dont feel empathy at the idea of my mother needing to dress me for my funeral.

Maybe one final selfish act and then everyone will feel peace. They won't hear me get mad over every small thing, they won't hear backtalk or an attitude. Maybe i wont be lonely anymore.

I’m too distraught to see rationally, and sometimes, I’m even genuinely convinced maybe it’s all because I don’t deserve to know what it is like to get better. But sometimes I’m just angry, like I am now. 

I can’t afford to go to a therapist. If I even could, I couldn’t afford to keep changing because one “didn’t work-out for me”. Seeing a counsellor irregularly who only speaks to be for half-an-hour is not enough to even START on my problems. I’m volatile. I can be feeling completely OK one-moment, and the next, I’m ready to just finally do something to leave me dead and gone. But I know all the reasons I won’t just spontaneously take my life, and yet, who am I supposed to reach-out to? I’ve witnessed it personally before — if you aren’t going to confess that you’re actively TRYING to kill yourself, they’ll do nothing for you. And if you DO suggest you’re at that point…? Everything is pulled from you and you’re placed in the hospital where the staff are overworked, and some don’t even care. 

And the thing is, I understand these resources may actually work for some-people, which makes me feel happy for them; all I want is for people to not have to suffer alone and unheard.

1mnzjgp,"i sexually assaulted someone and i believe it would be better to end it, than live on with guilt","TW: Sexual Assault

back in november last year, me and my gf (now ex) went to her house and decided to use a stick for penetration (for context, we’ve been doing this since around april-may), we were completely fine with it right before we were about to do it. this is when it happened: she told me to stop and i didn’t, after like 10ish seconds i did stop but i didn’t know the damage i did to her (and i don’t even know why i didn’t stop, i could do it before but at that time i didn’t) she told me afterwards that she was crying when i didn’t stop and told me it was rape and i basically raped her, i was pretty much distraught after this event and scared too, because i just realised that i was a really horrible person. i begged for forgiveness and felt remorse for my gf (now ex). for some reason, she stayed with me until february where she told her parents and forced us to break up, pretty understandable, right? 

at the end of april, start of may, she reported me to the police and we had interviews for our side of the story and eventually might be going to court. i hated myself for that so much because firstly, again i didn’t even know why i did it, secondly i had no one to lean on as everyone left after hearing about it and thirdly, i fully isolated myself from the public because i know how much i can hurt people and i just don’t want someone like me who hurt an innocent soul to be around people who can live their lives so carefree. i fully believed that i could bring justice to the wrongdoings i did by simply killing myself and this thought kept rattling my mind ever since may. i was scared of everything because i felt guilty, i couldn’t bring myself out of it, every distraction, every laugh, every smile i put, at some point, those feelings of guilt and wanting to die started to pile up. and it’s slowly getting to me. i felt that maybe that if my freedom or life ends, theirs can finally begin (which is reasonable in many aspects) its just my stupid brain that doesn’t want me to end myself. i can’t live with this guilt anymore and i’ve been holding it in for so long. she finally lives a happy life with someone else that i wished it was me. all because i couldn’t stop myself, that i will never know the reason why i didn’t decide to stop at that moment of time. i can write so much more but i just can’t, the more i think about it, the more i just don’t want to live due to my actions. and it’s not like i want sympathy either, because i know what i did is wrong and i believe i should be imprisoned due to it, but it’s the fact that i could be living a life with her that keeps me up at night, the guilt is getting to me

TL;DR: i sexually assaulted someone and felt really horrible afterwards, they reported me and now ive been living with the guilt ever since

1mnttka,I'm a disappointment,"Hi... this isn't the first time i've posted here, but its the first time in several years. I'd stopped using reddit for a while, but now i'm back on it.

I'm a 23yo afab american struggling with depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and ocd. I'm unable to hold a job for long because I get sick often (chronic migraines, weakened immune system), and just... mental health reasons.

Today I had to leave work because of a migraine/sickness and... this is the third time i've gotten sick and I started this job three weeks ago. My parents (still live at home, due to said issues) are... Disappointed in me.

I want to make them proud, i want to be *normal*, but I'm not. I'm a disappointment. I can't hold a job, I can't get disability because i'm ""not disabled enough"". i have weekly therapy, but it doesn't help when I'm actually out and about, because I... I just. Everything is overwhelming and I just *can't*. I try so hard, but I can't handle feeling sick or pain, it just... It gets overwhelming and I can't function.

I just want to be *normal*. Maybe then I'd have a stable job, a good income, and my parents would be proud of me. Not... Disappointed and upset that I'm ""not trying hard enough"". I *am*, i swear I am. I just... I can't express to them how I feel, the words just don't come to me... And even if they did, they think i'm lying or exaggerating because doctors find nothing wrong with me

I'm passively suicidal generally, but on days like this, where I just feel like shit... I actually think of ways. And I know I could do them. I'm... So tired of feeling like a burden and a disappointment.",1754957703.0,4,0,SuicideWatch,suicide

I need plastic surgeries that is tooo mentally draining, expensive and risky

I need a better face but too bad i was. Raised in this broke family that gave me some good trauma too!

1mnlsb2,Not sure why to go on anymore.,"I'm 40. I've been alone all my life. I've battled anxiety, depression, and a few other fun ones. I'm intelligent and highly empathetic, but those traits don't matter to anyone. Also, as a man, once you decide to stop putting effort in, everything goes away - no one is going to reach out to you. If you can't provide anything (""safety"" in the biological sense, money, etc) or you aren't attractive, you are disposable as a man.

I have friends that are all married and live far away. Whenever I try to make new ones people distance themselves from me. I just don't fit in. I'm too anxious or too depressed. I mask very well, but I'm also not attractive and I'm short, so people don't really have any reason to be friends with me.

**On ""good"" people and self improvement:**

For the longest time I thought being a good person, caring, empathetic, volunteering, helping those who don't fit in - would mean I'd eventually find happiness and/or that people would reciprocate the effort into me. I was wrong.

I even tried self improvement - to go to the gym and be stronger, healthier, more fit. Still, no one cares.

**Conclusion:**

Oh well. What I can say is, for all those who relate - **it doesn't get any better**. I wish it did. People are awful. They will exclude you for being different, and then make you out to be the bad person when you finally let your anger out. ""What's your problem?"" - My problem is that no one is changing and everyone is being driven by their biology and not by empathy or love or decency or inclusion.
