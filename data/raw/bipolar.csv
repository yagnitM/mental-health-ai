kr9uh4,Welcome to BipolarReddit! A Message from the Community,"Welcome! This is a community focused on supporting people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. If you are bipolar, we‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here. We are a judgement-free community that wants to see all people diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve enduring health and balance. 

As you explore the discussions, here is a primer on how this community works.

* Most people who post and comment on r/BipolarReddit have already received a medical diagnosis, including bipolar type 1, type 2, schizoaffective or cyclothymia. If you have not yet sought a diagnosis, we encourage you to meet with a doctor, discuss your concerns and solicit their diagnosis. However, you are welcome to read and ask general questions in your pursuit of health.  
* A medical diagnosis can only be given by a medical professional. If you are concerned enough about your mental health to ask if you are bipolar, that is sufficient reason for you to seek a medical opinion. None of us participate here in a medical capacity, and no one here can or will tell you if you are bipolar. Those kinds of questions are not for this subreddit.
* We like to be precise. Terms like mania, hypomania and major depression have specific definitions, and we ask you to familiarize yourself with the medical terminology. We have created a wiki for (and authored by) people with bipolar disorder, based on the DSM-V. Please [review the definitions](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index/definitions). **Important Note:** The terms mania and hypomania are often conflated, inaccurately. Please be exact in your use of these terms when posting and commenting because it helps the community understand the severity of what you are experiencing, which helps us give you the best support. Mania is a medical emergency that typically requires hospitalization. We understand that it can be hard to know exactly what is going on in the moment. Just do your best so we can better understand you. 
* We invite you to [explore the rest of our subreddit‚Äôs wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index), which has valuable information and resources this community has compiled. There are some common questions for people with bipolar disorder. Before posting a question, please look through the wiki to see if your question has already been answered.  
* Harassment is not tolerated, and this subreddit is actively moderated. Do not post anything that is hateful or hurtful to others‚Äô path to health. Robust discussion and strong opinions are most welcome, but keep it kind. If you see harassment, report the post or comment and use the ‚ÄúMessage the Mods‚Äù button with any background information, if you have it. Please do not engage. We will get to it as quickly as we can. 
* If you are not bipolar, you may want to visit r/BipolarSOs or related subreddits. This is not a place to discuss bipolar on behalf of someone else or seek opinions on whether someone else is bipolar. The one exception is if you have an urgent help question and need a fast answer (e.g., ‚ÄúMy SO is diagnosed bipolar and is currently psychotic, what do I do?‚Äù). 
* We don‚Äôt do memes, art or other popular media. Such posts will be removed. We are purely focused on support through discussion.",1609886701.0,357,0,BipolarReddit,bipolar
1dtn1k7,Free peer support groups in-person and online,"Peer support is when people use their own firsthand experiences to help others dealing with similar challenges. [Research underscores](https://www.madinamerica.com/2012/06/13316/) the profound impact of peer support on mental well-being, including increasing sense of hope, happiness, control, self-esteem, and community, and decreasing levels of depression and psychosis.

Peer support among people living with mood disorders [has been shown to](https://www.mhanational.org/sites/default/files/Evidence%20for%20Peer%20Support%20May%202019.pdf):

* Reduce hospitalizations
* Reduce days in inpatient care
* Reduce overall cost of mental health services
* Increase use of outpatient services
* Increase quality of life
* Increase whole health

Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) is a national peer advocacy organization focused on peer support. DBSA peer support groups are always free, open to anyone with depression or bipolar disorder (and their friends, family, and caregivers), and are available in-person and online.

DBSA support groups are always run by peers--not a clinician, psychologist, or therapist, but someone who also lives with bipolar disorder or depression, who has received training to facilitate, and who understands what you're facing.

1mqmya7,The Power of the Right Meds AKA Don‚Äôt Settle for Baseline Depression,"So when I was struggling with finding the right medication, dealing with horrible side effects, feeling so flat and utterly hopeless, I would come to this sub and see people saying ‚Äúoh you just need to find the right med combo!‚Äù

But that felt like such a distant fantasy, in the midst of meds that worked ok in terms of keeping mania away, but didn‚Äôt really give me a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù quality of life, let alone a life I liked. My baseline was the constant drudgery of depression. 

So, naturally, I would convince myself I didn‚Äôt need meds, go off them, blow up my life, and land in the hospital, jail, rehab etc. This routine repeated for four years.

But now‚Ä¶ I am on the right med combo. I am the happiest and healthiest I have been since I was a young child, no joke. And I gotta say, it‚Äôs really worth it to find a doctor to work with to find the right meds. 

A lot of doctors (I feel like they all tend to be male too but maybe that‚Äôs just me) will settle if you‚Äôre not manic when you have a BD diagnosis.  

Finding a med combo that works is life changing. Don‚Äôt settle for baseline depression!!

First miracle drug: Seroquel XR
The missing piece: Lamictal

1mqiyqu,I am having trouble getting the help I need + I genuinely cannot do all these things.,"I am 19F, Bipolar 1 with psychotic features.

I was diagnosed In june, just a couple days after my birthday. I told my dad and it didnt go well so i didnt bother telling my mom. he said i was just 'anxious', I should see his friend who is a therapist instead, and that psychiatrists (which i went to) will diagnose everyone who comes to them.

He told me to get a second opinion and I am still working on it. I have to pay everything out of pocket since I havent reached my insurance deducible. I make minimum wage and all of this is draining my money. 

Last week i was going to have a meeting with my psychiatrist and my dad to speak of my diagnosis and get a second opinion but i cancelled it the day before. I am in an episode now--depressed (mixed episode) which is why i have some insight. I cancelled the appointment the day before--made the appointment again--then cancelled it.

I also have to go to my primary (havent set up yet) and get tests done before seeing it lithium is a good idea for me. I am unmedicated right now--no therapy. But all of this is under my control and I cant keep up with it. I just bought a car, I only have like $400 now which may be a stretch. My parents wont help me. one of the first things my dad told me when i told him about my diagnosis was 'Do you know how much thats going to cost? dont take any meds they tell you to take'

im not too sure what to do. I cant hold myself accountable to follow through with these things. I'm still trying to get myself to work everyday. plus classes are starting back up in 2 weeks.

All seemingly much more extreme than the average person.

And then right after the adrenaline wears off‚Ä¶crashing hard. Feeling sick and nauseous. The entire world feels dull. And many more negative symptoms.

I have these up and downs all throughout each day, sometimes minute to minute. I assume this is just a general neurodivergent trait, not fitting a specific category. Probably a mix of things versus just dopamine disregulation. Wondering if anyone else deals with this, and if so I assume the only advice you get is take a med and diet/exercise/sleep improvements?

1mqacgn,Feeling lost and unsure of how to move forward‚Ä¶,"I feel lost and I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôve been recently diagnosed since April of this year, and leading up to this point has been a complete shit show for a lack of better words. Cycling in and out of therapy, pushing loved ones and relationships away and feeling a deep sense of pain/loss as a result. This time last year, I went on a rapid blocking spree on my social media due to the paranoia and delusions from the mania itself. I know I‚Äôve been rapid cycling between my depression and my mania as of late. The last therapeutic services that I was enrolled in prescribed me Seroquel but due to being discharged from their services (time conflicts/group attendance policy) I haven‚Äôt been on any medication since. I‚Äôve been trying to cope with the symptoms by smoking weed but even that has been difficult because while it helps me sleep somewhat better, I think it makes my manic symptoms feel more heightened. 


There‚Äôs been some several other external factors apart from the weed usage that have made my mania and depression very difficult to control. The previous days prior, I trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è took a large handful of some acid reflux meds. So in the coming days it‚Äôs definitely looking like I‚Äôm going to be heading to the hospital to have an intake preformed and to go from there. I don‚Äôt know what all its going to take for me to get better. It‚Äôs been therapist after therapist, appointment after appointment. I feel so alone being in my head all of the time. I feel really stupid and ashamed of my behavior when I reach a point where I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôm in control of my mood and temper anymore.

1mq6fiq,My story with meds-hoping to help somebody,"Before you read: This is not a recommendation to go off or cut down on your meds!!! I just wanted to share what worked for me after trying different meds for 8 yrs. 

TDLR: after trying everything from lithium to lamotrigine to rTMS, the thing that finally helped get me out of a 7 yr cycle of depression and SI was 10 mgs of Escitalopram(Lexapro, Cipralex) and just 50 mgs of Lamotrigine. This has given me my energy back and I feel stable for the first time since my diagnosis 9 yrs ago. I am type 2, suffer from long, deep depressions and almost no hypomania. 

I was diagnosed at 36, pregnant with my second child. After he was born I was put on Lamotrigine. 10 months later I had a breakdown, was severely depressed and suicidal. I had a full dose of Lamatrogine. An antidepressant was added. I slooooowly recovered but kept on getting serious depressive episodes despite being super-compliant and taking good care of myself. The meds made me tired and gave me brainfog and I still didn‚Äôt feel better. I get rTMS, doesn‚Äôt help. We switch to lithium, helped for about 6 months, the back to business again. This spring I told my doctor I wanted to come off the lithium because it wasn‚Äôt helping. Despite being on the right dose I was having severe SI. 

The doctor said she wanted to try something different. Since I am type 2 and have loooong depressions and almost none existent hypomania, she would put me on a low dose of antidepressants and a low dose of mood stabilizers. It worked! 5 months in with 10 mg Escitalopram and 50 mg of Lamotrigine and I feel like a new person. I have to be careful of course and I do not do anything risky and take very good care of myself. But so far I‚Äôm more stable and more energetic than I have been since my diagnosis. Me and my husband are getting divorced(amicably) and it didn‚Äôt cause an episode.

I dont--I usually get the delusional kind. but anyway here was the dream:

i am awake and that is bad news but just listen: i had a dream ( because i took a nap after work and just now woke up at 10:10 pm. I was very sleepy. I was happily going through my life‚Äîmeeting new people, going to classes, etc. this womans name was  ros√® and I know this because it was the password to my garage. Anyway after all of my social things began to quiet down thats when I noticed her.



every time i would leave and open the garage she would be standing outside, smiling. she wa very happy and always wore a floral dress and cardigan. I also really hated her. but also she wasnt a looker. she wore a single camellia in her hair. Anyway when I would come out she would the off‚Äîskipping away. the first couple of time i was like‚Ä¶oh so i closed the garage to regroup for a couple of minutes. when I opened the garage again‚Äîthere she was again standing in front of it.



after a while i got very annoyed and paranoid. I couldnt catch her because she always ran. I thought she would go and bring someone back to hurt me. Anyway, I began chasing her as best as i could. She was always 16 feet ahead of me. she would stop all the way in the distance and stare if she had to.



anyway now im going to be up all night playing the paranoia game.



I feel like a fear that i had when I was 12 is evolving. I was afraid of the dark--this paranoia comes at night. I was afraid that someone would be looking through my windows--and now here we are. like is it possible to have a fucking bipolar dream?? i am not psychotic and I am not manic. in fact im in the downswing.

I‚Äôm privilege and because of that I‚Äôve achieved what I have. I‚Äôve gone to esteemed institutions because my father could afford it. So not really my hard work or contributions. 

I‚Äôm 25 and below average looking, embarrassing love life plus crania facial hyperhydrosis so low confidence too.

It‚Äôs been a little over 1 month in which I noticed changes in my sleep. It started as a few days on a row with insomnia each week (this happened for 2 weeks in a row, my mood was pretty ‚Äúmeh‚Äù during this time and no other symptoms, except for exhaustion and some body aches). I at first thought this was just stress because I had recently started a new job, and the insomnia would always come back on sunday nights and would go away after the middle of the week, I thought it was just stress and some anxiety and that‚Äôs it.

Until last week‚Äôs Sunday came (August 3rd). Insomnia started again, but this time it stayed. Now it‚Äôs become a daily struggle. Last week my psych upped my meds, of course still no changes. Im only on lamotrigine and I did great for a year on just that. He also prescribed some benzo idk the name that I should take as needed for sleep, but I didn‚Äôt because im scared of waking up hungover or something and not be able to perform at my job (im an english-spanish interpreter over the phone, i need to be constantly thinking in both languages, taking notes and retaining tons of information)

I also noticed, during the first days I had been having lower energy, then for a few days after that I was fine energy wise without that much sleep because of insomnia. And now I‚Äôm back into the low energy levels..

The thing is, ive only ever had those two episodes last year that I mentioned (plus some sort of subsyndromal depressions and instability since my late teens). Im extremely scared that I will fall back into depression again.

1moq7ph,What films are potentially destabilising for a person with bipolar disorder?,"I just watched the rare 1985 anime film ""Angel's Egg,"" for the first time and although I secretly loved the beautifully haunting, ambiguous, intricate and symbolic imagery, I found the film's overall mood and existential themes to be quite overwhelming and triggering in a way that they wouldn't have been before my most recent psychotic episode. 

I could feel myself getting into a cyclical feeling of existential dread and depressive rumination as the credits rolled. I heard the iconic piano music from the credits about a year ago on Spotify and instantly loved it but thought it was an art piece and not a soundtrack.

My mind is trying to make philosophical/spiritual connections to the movie that could spiral into another episode. Although the film suits my tastes exactly I find myself having to be more cautious with heavier art films like this since relapsing, which is a shame.

I lived a minimally functional year off of meds, marked by severe depression/disorganization/agitation/social isolation/obsessive compulsive behavior/etc. Nothing really made me happy or satisfied, things I enjoyed in the past would only heighten my own internal agitation. at 20 I was put on lithium and seroquel which have eliminated my suicidal thoughts, but didn‚Äôt do much to improve my functionality. Now at 21 I‚Äôve finally accepted the addition of Wellbutrin + vyvanse + Zoloft, and it feels like my life had changed. I can‚Äôt believe I lived like I did for so long‚Ä¶ but I was deathly afraid of developing permanent tardive dystonia again and that‚Äôs why I avoided trying out more meds :( Plus I had lived my entire adolescence without romantic feelings due to being medicated, and I was afraid I‚Äôd have to go back to that again. I‚Äôm having trouble coping with all of this and I want to cry and yell at my past self for letting things spiral out of control so badly. Nobody fucking gets it. The only reason I lived like that is because I was afraid I would literally have to give up my ability to walk.

1mp0tji,Are ADA accommodations and FMLA dependent on one another?,"I had to use all my yearly allotted FMLA last fall. Unfortunately I still have not found medications that work for me and I‚Äôm in a very long manic episode. I‚Äôm able to go to work and only use my PTO, but I‚Äôm really, really struggling, and not sleeping in order to keep up with this. I decided to apply for ADA accommodations, because I thought I could get a couple extra unpaid days off per month. My job denied me, saying I have enough PTO as it is, and that I can apply for FMLA again in September on the anniversary of my last year‚Äôs absence. 

Was I just straight up denied ADA accommodations, or do you need to have FMLA time available in order to get unpaid days off at all? Are they dependent on one another? Or can you take your full FMLA time and still get ADA accommodations that allow more unpaid time off?

1motlar,"New perspective on ""Angel's Egg.""","I realise that I was the girl. A person who believed in idealism, faith and spiritual teachings. When the underpinnings of my beliefs started to crack under the real weight of an unpredictable reality, the egg of my life revealed itself to me as having nothing in it. I wanted to believe that God had been talking to me, but clutching ever tighter to a broken empty egg is clutching at a reality that does not exist, and that's exactly what I was doing. I did not want to accept that my egg had gestated nothing and was in fact a symptom of psychosis, not spiritual attunement. Aghast at the shattering of my reality I gripped harder but felt like the broken egg myself, no longer having a spiritual purpose or reason. My faith was ironically so strong that anything that challenged it led to a level of despair so painful that it led me to attempt on my life. And in the midst of the shattered, broken world I had found myself in, I awoke, not as the innocent child, but as the tempered weary soldier.",1755055292.0,3,0,BipolarReddit,bipolar

I guess I‚Äôm wondering how much of the dumb shit i did was dumb teenager shit, vs hypomania. My most vivid memory of what was now in hindsight hypomania, is that i got prescribed Prozac for my depression/ocd, and it felt like crack to me. I would stop and start the meds for the rush it would give me. I‚Äôd start sleeping about 4-5 hours and waking up ready to go, doing so much shit every day. I think the antidepressants brought me up past normal. I locked in and ended up graduating in 3 years because, like i said, it felt like crack. But I‚Äôve said and done so much dumb shit. I have a stupid tattoo, said so much dumb shit that ruined my reputation, spent so much random money. Now it feels like i was living my life in a haze.

In this zoom session he would continuously take our conversation off the topic of medications and current symptoms, you know, all the stuff youre supposed to talk about with your psychiatrist.. he got us on the topic of my past as an exotic dancer of 7 years. I only mentioned that i used to be a dancer ONCE during my intake half a year ago because its part of my trauma history that i felt necessary to disclose for treatment.

After i explained my symptoms and stuff he proceeded to bring up another one of his patients that is currently a dancer and was talking down on her for not actively wanting to get out of the industry and ""get true help, but he admires that i got out and am actually taking treatment serioisly.""  I didnt know how to respond so I said ""umm thanks so anyway back to the medications..."" he them continued to interupt me mid sentence and started asking me stuff about exotic dancing then started talking about his dating life and the date he recently went on that went south once she found out he was a psychiatrist... right after i told him the meds he perscribed me were sending me into mania and bad suicidal ideation.... im.. very dissapointed and confused.

i was paranoid. went into a grocery store and kept seeing the same people and thought they were plain clothes employees tailing me because they thought i was shoplifting, and i would loudly say ‚Äúlooks like we got a floorwalker‚Äù in their earshot so that they knew i knew.  

every time id hear a car come by i thought it was the cops there for me and id check out the window. one time i saw my neighbors outside around 9pm and i convinced myself they were leaving from a sinister cult meeting and i was sick to my stomach about what they had done in there . zero basis for that btw besides the fact they were leaving from what looked like a gathering at 9pm. i was able to understand it wasn‚Äôt rational but i could just feel it and couldn‚Äôt really shake it.  i also started having really messed up paranoid thoughts about my family, accusing them of horrible things i can‚Äôt even get into  in my mind from very loose/circumstantial evidence but it made me distressed because i started to think it could be true. 



during this time, i had zero real responsibilities in life. no occupation. just at home 24/7/  with fellow crazy people/ in public but i absolutely know for CERTAIN this would‚Äôve caused marked impairment if i did have any responsibilities.  and i‚Äôve been hypomanic before, trust me this is something else. there were a few times i felt terrified that i was gonna lose my mind/ that i was losing control and only external factors could help ground me.  i remember id look in the mirror and feel terrified/unreal. but if i was alone i think i would‚Äôve lost my mind fully.  there were a lot of times during this where it turned dysphoric and i felt paralyzed , heart pounding, feeling disgusted and wanting to crawl out of my own skin, restless, agitated. only external factors could flip it back into euphoric mania. 

during this time my appetite tanked too and i was getting noticeably thinner and there were a lot of times i felt really sick from undereating /low sodium. 

during this time i was also very physically active aswell. like very much so  if i wasn‚Äôt doing something in public id be pacing back and forth. 

id also like to note that around a week after this episode i took myself to the ER for the onset of an episode that was even more intense than this, but they said because i took myself i still had insight so wasnt mania. ",1755009194.0,1,11,BipolarReddit,bipolar
1mnuecg,Can't get over manic shame from high school,"I'm 26 years old, and still struggle with enduring the shame from my first manic and psychotic episode when I was 16. Basically I had really bad social anxiety/panic attacks and tried my first AD, Lexapro, during the winter break of my junior year after throwing up in school all the time from my panic attacks. I quickly developed mania and psychosis that lasted 9 months straight, and I went from the quiet transfer student who didn't talk to anybody to a fucking annoying clown everyone was scared of. Ppl recorded my delusional rants and stupid stunts I made in school on snapchat and twitter and they went viral to other schools in my state, everyone made rumors I was on meth. This lasted until the beginning of my senior year when I fell into a deep depression and had to go to an adolescent IOP for half the year for suddenly crying uncontrollably during classses.

It's gotten a lil better over time, even did EMDR years back to help with the flashbacks I would constantly have of embarrassing shit I said and did when I was manic that caused me to self-harm. But a few days ago I saw a movie that took place in a high school with a friend and had to excuse myself as I started crying uncontrollably in the bathroom. Saw a kid I knew in high school at Barnes and Noble a month ago and when he said hi I immediately started apologizing for acting like an idiot when we were young (he claims he genuinely doesn't remember what I was talking about).

Idk ig I just still feel slighted over not having a high school experience (ik, there's a lot worse things in the world to cry and complain about lol). I was bullied at my previous all-boys school and so I found like I might've actually had a chance for acceptance as a transfer to my local public school, but I quickly fucked that up as I became a freak. 

It's been ten years, I should be over it by now but I just can't for some reason. And to think I've had wayyy worse manic/psychotic episodes following that but I can't even fully get over my first one. Idk ig I feel slighted out of not having had a real high school experience, I was bullied at my all-boys private school beforehand and felt like I might've had a chance to be accepted after transferring to my public school but I fucked that right up when the mania started. 

Shit I was so ill I didn't even apply to college at the time, despite working my ass off academically as a teenager thinking I had a shot at going to an Ivy League. Hated myself and my life but at least I had my grades at the time to hate myself less and convince myself I would ""make it"" in the long run. Now I'm a returning community college student still trying to get my life together, grades have been good (still got my 4.0 and got another 2 or so semesters left) and I'm trying my best to hold everything together despite being depressed 24/7 but idk watching this movie just reminded me of all I had lost to this illness. Ik everything has their own timeline but I can't help but compare myself all the time to the peers I grew up with and feeling ashamed seeing their success meanwhile I feel so stuck",1754959249.0,9,10,BipolarReddit,bipolar
1mnt6ip,Neglecting myself during depression,"Hello, I've never posted something on reddit. I have a problem and I was hoping to get some advice or knowing I'm not alone I guess. I'm 32 (f) and I've been battling bipolar disorder. This is causing me severe problems and there is a thing that I can't seem te deal with. I'm more prone to depression because lithium helps with not getting manic. Because I'm depressed most of the time I have a hard time taking care of myself and I tend to isolate. My teeth are becoming a big problem. It's hard to brush my teeth and because I'm mostly alone at home I brush very rarely. I do go to the dentist more often to get it cleaned. but the main reason I can't brush is because I feel panic and immense shame because I can't take care of myself. I feel like i or the disease has ruined my life. I'm really trying to have self compassion of to accept is but I can't do it. I can't seem to get back up and accept or care enough about myself to make things better. I just feel like a loser, I can't even brush my teeth or my hair etc. I hope my story makes sense and that I will get some replies.

1mny6z6,I'm in a catch-22 and don't know what to do.,"My paradox is this:

I have to be *emotionally stable* and *healthy enough* to get better to gain my independence, but I also have to *gain my independence* in order to be stable. 

I left my parents house 2 years ago (the second time I left after 4 years of independence) and moved 600 miles away to start a new life in an entirely different country. Went completely NC.

I worked in the male-dominated tech industry in a professional job. Funnily enough I would encounter the same type of narcissistic monsters in upper management as my parents had been. 

They were pathologically jealous of my professional success and previous success as a fashion model and genuinely sabotaged my career just before I got a promotion. I had saved the company millions.

The company left me without any severance or notice, and I was left to starve and unable to pay my rent. I thought quickly and strategically on the spot and successfully gained employment at a different company during the 3 weeks in which I had left to stay at my apartment. The salary was going to be twice what I was earning before. I signed the contract. I was going to be finally living the life that I wanted to live my whole life. 

My parents inevitably came back into the picture. I begged my father to help me move into my new apartment so that I could quickly acclimatize to my new job. I also told him that I was starving and had nothing to eat and required money in order to not starve. 

He promised me to pay a deposit for an apartment in the new location, but then quickly rescinded his promise when he saw that he needed to be a guarantor. 

Where I live it's pretty much unheard of to rent an apartment without having a guarantor. I also asked if I could borrow some money so that I could eat. 

I kept messaging him for a week without any response. I thought about going to a food bank but I was waiting on the financial security that my father promised to give me. Learned helplessness is a b*tch. I also have bipolar so that kind of creates a no-win situation. I was incredibly depressed and suicidal. My mother told me that I only need to eat two meals a day anyway and that I can go long periods without eating and still survive.

I ended up starving for 3 weeks and getting hallucinations because I was starving. My mother told me if I was really serious about suicide I would have gone and done it by now and I wouldn't be talking to her about it on the phone. The same day that she told me this I attempted on my life. I went to hospital but they neglected me as well and told me to go home despite having severe electrolyte imbalances. My bipolar illness also got much worse. My dad came down to pick me up while I was near-unconscious and literally dying of starvation. Instead of taking me to a local hospital, he took me to a psych ward back in the city I had tried to escape from and had me sectioned there.

I was not given any treatment for the starvation aside from physical meals. I have had to take a record level of antipsychotic medications in order for the hallucinations to go away, and I have almost fully recovered from the illness.

But I am concerned about the neurological effects, both of the starvation and the psychosis resulting from it. Despite trying to leave twice in my adult life; despite having a professional degree; despite having worked for one of the largest media companies in the world, I am back in my original abuser's house - my mother's. 

I have had a grand total of three episodes of severe psychosis because my brain could not handle the severe and multifaceted level of relational trauma and decided to create a new reality to escape the horror of my current one. 

I am now on the right meds and I'm eating well, but I can't help but think where I would have been had my parents not tried to sabotage my life. I was a famous artist who was finally seeing commercial success before my coworker sabotaged my career. 

I was seeing a therapist just before I was ill but ultimately, living on my own for a year and a half with just my coworkers to talk to and a couple of friends did not help me. I was left to process the trauma largely alone, which led to everything bubbling up under the surface, and rearing its head just before an incredibly positive development, you could say almost as an unconscious form of self-sabotage.

Now I have the unique paradox of worrying that I'll never reach my previous level of functioning (which was incredibly high) both because of the starvation and the psychosis which can include cognitive difficulties that take a long time to remit after the illness stops being more floridly symptomatic. I was on the cusp of fully realising my creative career and had gained quite a bit of fame in the town I had chosen to live in. The traction I was gaining has been lost and I've also lost about 9 months that I could have been spending releasing new material, but I've spent it trying to get better from this garbage situation. 

My sister has told me that she feels her life would be better if I died; she keeps calling me a drug addict because I take psych meds to stabilise my mood; she's called me a loser because of the situation I'm in. I've also been called a freak, a psycho, insane, stupid, idiot. My mother tells me to f*ck off on an almost daily basis. She is pathologically narcissistic and it's such an effort to even try to have a normal conversation with her. Everything that was valuable to me has been lost. I just hope I can find it again. 

I essentially have had to deal with this sh*t all my life. I just hope I can get out. My hometown is quite distant and all of my friends live 600 miles away, so I'm unsure what my future is going to be. I've never felt so scared and so trapped in my entire life.

I just got sick and slept the whole day and it started there. My meds must be taken after meals so getting sick messed with my eating schedule.

It sucks to feel like everything takes effort, and for others to not know about how that feels to live a life where your entire existence is essentially just self care day in and out.

Feels like you have to be on point every day, but then sometimes the floor comes out and I just can't do it anymore.

I take Abilify and I don't know if that's contributing to my morning grogginess, but perhaps taking it earlier in the day would help? I currently take it at like 7:30/8 p.m. after dinner, but would taking it at like 5 work?

Anyway, to my early risers: what has worked for you to get up and stay up, even if you're not really feeling it initially?

  
Edit: UPDATE! I got up at 5:45 this morning!

1mmq2v8,Questions for anyone who has experienced thyroid hormone shifts and new issues with meds,"Ok, this is a long explanation, so sorry about the length of this post.

I am wondering if anyone in here has experienced having to change their medications due to thyroid hormone shifts while in treatment for Graves Disease or hypothyroidism? I have been in treatment for Graves Disease since May of last year (when I was diagnosed). I was put on Methimazole, a thyroid hormone suppressant, and up until April of this year I was either in a hyperthyroid state or in a euthyroid state and was fine just living my normal life. I switched endocrinologists halfway through treatment and she jacked up my suppressant dose very high. It put me in an over suppressed, functionally hypothyroid state. Everything in my life became awful, both physical health and mental health wise. I became incredibly anxious, obsessive/intrusive thoughts, and have been experiencing a lot of neuro inflammation (maybe it‚Äôs migraines?), too high of a resting heart rate, and joint issues. 

I have been on 600mg gabapentin and 10mg amitriptyline for many years and they worked well for me. No side effects, good sleep, stable moods. I previously didn‚Äôt tolerate anything in the SSRI/SNRI families, they made me incredibly irritable and some even made me hypomanic. I am BP 2. Finding the right mix of meds took a long time (like 2 years) and for about a decade, I was stable. I also imbibed THC a lot, but now I can‚Äôt tolerate it since my hormones flipped. I think I have developed severe side effects to the Amitriptyline. My psychiatrist has had me start very low dose fluvoxamine (slow introduction before titrating up). I want to go off the amitriptyline. When I‚Äôve previously stopped ami, I didn‚Äôt experience any withdrawal. In April, I tried going off it again and experienced very severe withdrawal and had to go back on it. I am hoping that my psychiatrist can issue me mirtazipine to help with sleep and H1 antihistamine support (what the Amitriptyline was doing along with mild serotonin and norepinephrine support) and that the fluvoxamine will provide better/stronger serotonin support (and it has anti-inflammatory properties) so I can try and wean off the amitriptyline (very slowly).

1mmj2e5,I'm losing my psych and therapist and might have to stop my meds again.,"I recently got married and my new insurance policy doesn't cover providers outside of my state (I live close to the state line and my current providers are located there). The resources for mental health in my area are very limited and one of my few options seems like I'll have to find someone in the city located an hour away from me; I did speak to them about telehealth services though so I'd like to think I wouldn't have to travel to the office too often if I do get in. I hate it because I love my therapist and she's helped me so much. My psych is also changing at the end of the month and I may only get to have one appointment with her. 

My whole debacle with this though is my husband and I are talking about trying for another baby and I was going to bring that up with my psych appointment to see what I need to do about my meds. See, when we were trying the last time, my psych at the time took me off of everything despite some of the meds being slightly safer for pregnancy. I spent over two years unmedicated because it took us 15 months to conceive and during pregnancy, though the pregnancy hormones leveled me out and I was stable for the first time in my life while unmedicated. Those 15 months though were hell with episodes and boughts of the occasional paranoia and what I now believe to be psychosis. 

I can't go through that again unmedicated because there's no telling how long this time it'll take to get pregnant. Back then, it was okayish because we didn't have a child to care for, but now with me having a toddler, I fear being totally unmedicated will be a trainwreck waiting to happen. I know I'll have to stop some of my meds because I did my research to see what was safe and unsafe for pregnancy, but again, I'm on a few things that are classified as being safer, though there's that chance I won't need them while pregnant if I have the same results as my previous pregnancy. 

The whole thing has stressed me out a bit, but I do want another child. I want to be the best mother I can be to the little boy I already have, and I feel like I can't be that person while off my meds. My own mother has spent most of her life unmedicated and her actions that she took while fighting this illness has resulted in a lot of trauma and my siblings and I going no contact with her. I don't want to turn out like her because my son needs a mother who is mentally well. 

Again, I'm gonna talk to the psych about it and see if I can stay on some things that I'm already on, but I won't know my options until I see her at the end of the month and that has caused me some anxiety. 

I'm just hoping when I do find a new provider that things go smoothly as well. ",1754833764.0,5,1,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1mm3ijg,I just need some support,"I need someone who isn‚Äôt currently in a severe depressive episode to tell me it‚Äôll be OK. (Or those that have gotten through it.)



I don‚Äôt feel like myself. My own apartment feels foreign to me and I feel like it‚Äôs a prison. I feel dread / horrible body sensation / panic / fear/ the deepest depression I‚Äôve felt in a long time / out of body / randomly sobbing all day / thoughts of I don‚Äôt want to be here. 



I drove 70 miles one way to take a drive and try to clear my mind. I ended up in Panna Maria, TX to pray at a historical church. I cried walking up the aisle in silence to just feel like God would her me. 



I dread being in my apartment, which used to be my safe space. I even have The Office on, which is my comfort show. 



I feel profound sadness, dread, a horrible full body sensation that starts upon waking. I sobbed when I woke up this morning. The only ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù I find is when it‚Äôs dark outside and closer to bed time. I can go in my room and lie down and put on my TV and try to sleep. 



I also need some advice on men and their thoughts. Hear me out. Im not well right now and may not be rational. I have been seeing a man for the last year. It‚Äôs been going well and we just got back from a trip at the beginning of July. Suddenly, I felt him try to pull away. He told me it had nothing to do with me and he felt like he was drowning and breathing underwater. I should have just left it alone, but he hadn‚Äôt said anything to me in 2 weeks, when I gave him space. Unfortunately, we work for the same company so I heard what may be going on - his dad isn‚Äôt doing well. (He has dementia) In my episode, I texted him that I hoped what I heard wasn‚Äôt true and he blew up. (He said he was done talking to everyone.)  I ended up texting him that I wanted to be there for him and that I loved him and he needs to know he‚Äôs not alone. I also sent an email telling him how I felt and I thought it was really nice. It felt good to let him know how I feel and that he‚Äôs not alone. (I‚Äôm not making this about me and being selfish. I honestly got paranoid with him not talking to me for 2 weeks.) I feel a profound sense of loss and sadness from this. (My therapist said I cannot be upset about things that haven‚Äôt happened yet and with his silence, he‚Äôs telling me what he wants right now.) 



I feel like if I wasn‚Äôt in this depressive episode I could see more clearly and just step back and let him deal with family issues. I‚Äôve stayed quiet for the last 7 days now. 



I am not rational. 



My psychiatrist increased my Seroquel last week. I had been on Wellbutrin for about 6 weeks and I feel like that drug caused the severity of what‚Äôs happening now. I have taken pretty much everything and seem to be resisent to meds. The Seroquel increase is also making me feel tired and I can‚Äôt function feeling high like that. Maybe my body would adjust, I don‚Äôt know.

1mlwmya,Does one episode make you bipolar?,"Back in July of 2022, I had a single depressive episode followed immediately by psychotic mania for about 4 days before a 72hour pink-slip hold in a psych ward. When I got out I was on low dose antipsychotic, but I wasn‚Äôt taking it correctly (thought I was supposed to let it dissolve under my tongue because that was the stuff they gave me in the ward). As a result it was not effective and about 3-4 weeks later I was psychotic/manic again, resulting in a voluntary 9-day stay in a different, better quality psych ward to figure stuff out. From there I was put on a higher dosage of the antipsychotic and an antianxiety/antidepressant. I guess you could say this is 2 separate episodes, but in my opinion, I never went back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in between these two stays.

That was 3 years ago now. The only ‚Äúwarning signs‚Äù I had in my life prior was that my anxiety would keep me up for hours at night if there was something stressful on my mind. Maybe that I was extremely religious, but I feel like that was more how I was raised. I also lived a life that was constantly go go go and never any relaxation or down time with all I was involved in.

This psychotic break/manic episode happened when I was under an immense amount of stress (graduating college, starting a new relationship, planning my best friend‚Äôs wedding, running competitively, being a RA, and moving 7 hours away for a PhD program). 

I have been tapering off the antipsychotic ever since becoming stable. I will prolly stay on the antianxiety/antidepressant the rest of my life, and I‚Äôm fine with that.

On tuesday this week, day 4 of taking it twice a day, I started experiencing neck stiffness and pain. This continued and on thursday I woke up with red, burning hands and swollen fingers on both hands, as well as very swollen lymph nodes in  my neck. The neck pain continued getting worse and on saturday I had developed a fever as well as a rash on my face and chest, and my neck started to feel like it was pulsating.

Yesterday (saturday) I went to urgent care, but I was told they couldn't tell me what was wrong, so I don't know for sure if it was a reaction or not. The symptoms I was concerned about were neck pain and stiffness, rash on my face and neck, headache, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue and fever. Part of my neck was also swollen. Not much testing was done, but they pricked my finger to test for bacterial infection, which was negative.

Since I don't know for sure if it was a reaction or not, I just wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced something like this after taking lamictal? Obviously no one here can diagnose me through the screen, but I'm wondering if I should seek further medical attention since the doctor I saw was pretty dismissive and said that all he could tell me was that I either had a viral infection or I had a reaction to the medication, but he didn't say anything about what kind of reaction it could be.

The doctor also said that no one could tell me what was wrong, which in my non-professional opinion sounds like an odd thing to say when all they did was prick my finger.
 
I've stopped taking the meds for now until I can speak to a psychiatrist again. I still have some of the same symptoms, but mostly neck pain/stiffness and nausea, plus a general feeling of being sick. Oh, and I have a rash on my arm and neck still.

TL;DR: Might've had a bad reaction to lamictal, urgent care doctor said he couldn't tell me if it's a reaction or a virus but didn't do much testing. Wondering if I should see another doctor.

I'm not asking for actual medical advice, just want to know if I'm overreacting or if I should get a second opinion.",1754780459.0,6,16,BipolarReddit,bipolar
1mm2bqf,Recently divorced and have spent so long thinking it was all my fault‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶only to start having memories flood back of the times I was taken advantage of or let down by my ex. TW: SA, infidelity, clusterfuck of a relationship

I did some objectively shitty things during our relationship - early on there was emotional infidelity on my part and before I became better at regulating my emotions I‚Äôm sure it was a fuckin rollercoaster being married to me with some dramatic mood swings and walking on egg shells. But on the flip side of that, she would lie about everrrrrything, big or small, including about flunking out of her first two semesters of college. She also sexually assaulted me at least a couple of times (that I know of) by having sex with me while I was asleep. I caught her in the act one night but I have no idea to this day if it was something she regularly did or not. In addition to those, she was often cruel or careless with our pets and I basically had to teach her how to be a good pet parent. And I made so many excuses for her throughout this time and forgave her and tried to move forward but how do you move on fully from some of those things?

I‚Äôm just frustrated I guess that I‚Äôm of course the bad guy because I‚Äôm bipolar and have BPD and I‚Äôm the one who ultimately left her. But no one seems to care about what I was put through in the relationship. I lost most of my close friendships when I chose to leave her and I can‚Äôt help but think that it‚Äôs because I always gave off the vibe that we had an idealistic relationship when realistically it had been rocky for years and years and there was just a toxic chain linking us together.

Sigh‚Ä¶ maybe someday I‚Äôll stop feeling dead inside over this chapter of my life ending. Despite everything I just said, I still want her back and miss our relationship. Isn‚Äôt that fuckin stupid of me?",1754778961.0,4,5,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1mm5uen,I was Hospitalized for a week,"I had seen a psychiatrist 7/16 and was prescribed lamotrigine 25mg for unspecified mood disorder. A few days after the appointment, I felt myself coming out of a depressive state to feeling good. I felt happy but kind of was losing sleep and wanting to do a lot. I was lifting weights and still needed to do more to get the energy out.

Fast forward a week and I was feeling that ""high"" they talk about. I dont think I was super talkative or talking fast but I definitely felt the hypersexuality, agitation and racing thoughts. Then on Tuesday night, the 29th I cut my long hair all off with scissors and was staying up late watching porn and stuff. The next day I did a walk in to a barber to fix the hair. During this time I was feeling sad but also wired af. Then the suicidal/self harm thoughts came along. I mean real bad. I called my parents since I couldnt even concentrate on my work. We went to the ER and they highly recommend I be admitted to the IP psych ward after questionnaire by the resident and a counselor. 

I have adhd and a history of substance abuse and have been around 30 days clean at this time. During my first few days there, I definitely crashed and slept a lot and cried. They continued the lamotrigine. The drs were not sure of bipolar and kind of left it up to being major depression and anxiety. They even went to BPD as a cause. This was after my mom had given history so I felt kind of ignored since I explained how cyclical my moods were vs random (PAWS) and reactionary (BPD).

So they gave me zoloft and pretty immediately (a day or two) I reacted with agitation, anger, racing thoughts, pacing down the halls and some self harm thoughts again. The Dr team changed the next week and said with this change in my mood most likely due to zoloft (the other meds were just lamotrigine at 50mg) that it basically confirmed bipolar unspecified. So they gave me seroquel and that calmed me very quickly and I got sleep back. So I was released a few days ago and have 50mg of seroquel with some hydroxyzine for as needed anxiety. 

They filled out my FMLA paperwork and wrote bipolar unspecified. I see my therapist and the outpatient psych dr I saw before this next week. I know the meds I'm on need time to get to the therapeutic dose so I'm somewhat relieved that the ssri experiment gives me medical proof of this dx. Sucks it had to get so bad to finally get it and the seroquel but I hope both of these meds help me. I believe my experience up to the ER visit was a mixed episode.

1mlwb1j,I think they changed my meds,"I think they switched my 150 Lamictal. I got my receipt prescription from Costco, I have only picked up 25s 3 different times and they have all been white. I was switching over pharmacies from CVS which took time but I had a layover with my pills. I was giving 150s for 90 days. So I had me White 150s from CVS while Costco would give me 25s. When I ran out of CVS 150s I asked my doc to fill it at Costco. When I picked them up they were cream. I thought it was off, checked online to see if they made them cream, made sure the label was correct and everything. Everything pointed to it being the real thing.

 I feel like I have been less stable after taking the Creams, but from my understanding you don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre manic. Or atleast make it happen. So then I was piecing it together last night and relized that they changed my mads they are messing with me. Idk if it‚Äôs the Gov, Docs, or the Pharmacy but I‚Äôm leaning heavily into the Government. There‚Äôs just to many things adding up recently. I didn‚Äôt take the 150s I don‚Äôt trust them. I did take my 25s for a total of 75mg and I have a psych apt on Wednesday.

So this morning I called Costco and I tried to ask basically to give me a new prescription and of only the white ones but I had to explain it like I wasn‚Äôt crazy. So it got me nowhere with them just telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably a dif manufacturer.‚Äù So I tried to ask them why are my 25s White and not my 150s. Same thing ‚Äúmanufacturer or mg amount‚Äù. They both came from Taro company, Which it owned by Sun Pharma the same company. Going to each website. Sun Pharma takes you to Taro. Taro says they have 150s in cream. So how do I get my white ones back. 

I think the pills are making me crazy, but I need my pills to make me not crazy. The Cream ones are to keep me sedated so they can some take me away. I think they bugged my car awhile ago. I can‚Äôt tell the reason why the gov is after me, it‚Äôll tell to much information and they would be able to find me faster. ",1754763490.0,7,19,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1mm35e0,Getting back to meds: Mania with Depression,"I returned my medication just a week ago after 2 years of denial of my Bipolar 1 (I made myself believe that I have recovered) and suddenly I had the moment of awareness and acceptance for the permanence of the diagnose and realized I do need help so I booked myself an appointment with my previous doctor and started my meds, lithium 600 and lamictal 25 (for the first week, eventually it was to increase to 100/day). 

The adaptation process is going extremely difficult. I never could have imagine this. I‚Äôm so manic and so depressed at the same time. My head is full of horrible thoughts about myself, leaning towards the dark end. At the same time I am wide awake at nights, full of hard to control energy. I feel like I am experiencing two different person plus me in the same body, which leds me question whether I have BPD(?). It‚Äôs extremely frustrating considering I was in a really balanced state before starting the meds. 

I also experience an intense brain fog, extreme clumsiness, very heavy eyes and eyebrows, and bad dreams. 

I texted my psych today and they increased the dosage for both lithium and lamictal. I have really strong symptoms for both ends and I don‚Äôt remember experiencing such thing before. 

I‚Äôm at my family home and it‚Äôs my nightmare to cause any more damage to them as I did years back because of my episodes. And this fear makes me freak out and act weirder and very insecure. I feel miserable and even though I logically know that it will pass, it does not feel like that at all.

1mlhhhr,"AI ""friends""","Hello fellow bipolars!

I just wanted to make a statement for the young bipolar out there. 

Don't get invested in AI ""friends"". I have started seeing advertisements for AI ""friends"" and ""girlfriends"" more frequently and it makes me so upset for young mentally ill people who don't have access to good healthcare or treatment for their disorder. 

As human beings we NEED community, we need friendships, we need intimate relationships, we need this stuff and as mentally ill people we need it even more than nuetotypicals. 

Without my found family that I have built over my lifetime I would not be the fully rounded more or less healthy person that I am. 

Friendships, partnerships, and community help make us who we are and can teach us how to navigate this world. Finding people who share your interests and your values enabled you to grow as a person, help you avoid pitfalls in life, and further your emotional and mental development and your career development. 

If you are struggling to find community, and I imagine people are. Since the pandemic it seems people have become more and more isolated, I have seen many post of people asking ""did you all really party like that"". Partying being the example but just in general young people getting together and letting loose, talking about what excites you, and sharing time with other people is so, so, so important. 

To continue, if you are struggling to find community, figure out what you enjoy and what excites you whether it be music, art, dancing, drinking (in moderation and for the purpose of spending time with others), running (exercise in general), meditation, reading, poetry, whatever it is that gets you going and makes you excited GET OUT THERE AND DO THOSE THINGS. 

And if you can't find those things in your city, PUT THEM ON YOUR SELF. I spent my 20s throwing concerts pretty much where ever I lived, I slowly found a community of people who shared my values and whoI got a long with and slowly we ended up having as good a turn out for our concerts as a small venue can get. I also threw art parties where we would have a group art project that anyone of any talent could be apart of. These group activities gave me some of the best friends I have ever had who I am still really good friends with to this day. 

It gave me people I could turn to when my disorder got the best of me. It gave me people I could call when I was having trouble with drinking or drugs. And I developed as an artist in a musician in those spaces. 

I also developed as a human being in those spaces. I learned from other people's experiences and changed my behavior based on those learned experiences. I became more empathetic with people I didn't understand or people I did not grow up next to. And all around I became a better human being because of those experiences. 

All of this is possible right now. If you have a living room and some art supplies, or you have a friend with an audio setup for amplification. Or you even just have a book that you really like and you want to start a book club. 

The internet isn't just for talking to people on the internet. It's an excellent way to get the word out that you are doing this thing that really excites you and anyone near you who is also excited about those things can join you. 

And I won't lie to you they were plenty of times where only one or two people showed up. 

There were plenty of times where it was just me. 

But more often than not and the more I was consistent about the behavior the more my community always grew. And I ended up with friends for life. 

Don't get trapped in the allure of an easy AI friend, find some real human beings who love what you love and bring them together, or just join them if they're already there. ",1754716946.0,15,1,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1mlhel8,Wake Up Call,"An argument in which I had a disproportionate reaction lead to a much larger conversation about my current mental health state. 

While it was not explicitly said, I know from my own past, current situation, and what my partner said tonight, that if I do not address this sudden decline in my mental health, I will lose everything. I will lose my job opportunity, I will lose my partner, I will lose my friends, and I will certainly lose my sanity to the point where I will *definitely* attempt again. And that is something I thought I overcame back in 2020. 

I have a psychiatrist that I see regularly, but my therapist has been pretty unavailable except for 4-6 weeks between each appointment. My partner and I have been arguing lately about my therapist‚Äôs lack of availability. At my last appointment yesterday, even before tonight‚Äôs argument, I realized my therapist is no longer working for me and I need to switch to someone more available. 

It‚Äôs a certain kind of grief to find myself in a similar situation to nearly 7 years ago. I know healing is never linear but damn is it painful to know you circled back to being a fuck up.

1mkx5fd,Discontinuing Vraylar/Trileptal and ARFID-type symptoms?,"Hi moody fellas and broads,

Going to cross post this in the Vraylar sub too, but hoping someone might have some feedback or a similar situation they can help me troubleshoot with. 

I‚Äôve been dx BP1 since Feb 2020. Fortunately, therapy, medication, a subsequent ADHD diagnosis in 2022 and medication for it, neurofeedback, and lifestyle accommodations have improved my mood and behavioral symptoms to the point where I felt comfortable experimenting with discontinuing Vraylar (6mg/day) and Trileptal (300mg/day.) Admittedly, I did stop these cold turkey on June 5. I have felt pretty good by and large with the adjustment, improving on sleep (I used to really struggle with the sedation from those meds and was basically a full on hypersomniac), I lost 15 lbs without trying, I was able to taper my ADHD meds down to a better therapeutic dose, my sex drive is back‚Ä¶ no concerns with going back on either med. 

However, a weird side effect has emerged over the time I‚Äôve been off the meds. I will preface this with saying I have ALWAYS struggled with chronic nausea, a really strong gag reflex that is super easily triggered, problems regurgitating food, diarrhea and bowel urgency, and incomplete emptying (what I suspect to be a wonky gut-brain axis, I‚Äôm seeing a GI and dietitian separately for this.) I also do have a history with disordered restrictive eating because I was active on Tumblr in 2014. The most troubling symptom I‚Äôve seen that I have not had before seems to mimic ARFID symptoms. I already struggle with regular food intake (unless my evening cannabis treat of choice is taking effect muahahaha). Food textures that were formerly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and reliable staples for quickly fueling up (Soft, spongy carbs, e.g. a PB&J, a grilled cheese, english muffin w butter, bagel and cream cheese, muffins, soft pretzels or rolls, etc) have been REALLY unpleasant and triggering. This breaks my heart because I love all those foods :( they seem appetizing and trigger positive responses (my stomach growls, I salivate, it smells good) but when I‚Äôm actively masticating the food, I‚Äôm overwhelmed with disgust at the sensation in my mouth (particularly when it comes to getting it past my soft palate and down my throat) and I gag or have to spit out what I‚Äôm chewing. 

Is this temporary???? My dietitian advised me to see a SLP if it persists. I‚Äôm so tired of not having a normal relationship with food‚Ä¶. I just want to eat what I enjoy. I‚Äôm NOT even a picky eater. As a child I allegedly ate like a trucker. Anorexia (ok, technically orthorexia but she doesn‚Äôt have her DSM badge yet!) butted in briefly in my teens and connected the dots between my fucked up gut-brain-anxiety-dysfunction and my preference for ‚Äúpure‚Äù foods, so now I can only nibble cucumber slices with everything bagel seasoning without yakking.

Curious if anyone else has similar experiences with Ritalin.

Disclaimer: I've been taking Ritalin for months now, and the feeling I get that reminds me of hypomania isn't actually hypomania, it usually fades with the Ritalin.

1mjzv2q,zyprexa ruined me,"for anyone willing to read.

i‚Äôve been prescribed with so many different medications, none ever seemed to work but i never noticed bad side effects which is good i guess. UNTIL about three years ago when i had a very bad psychotic break, hospitalized for a month and was told i was experiencing drug induced psychosis. looking back, it was the scariest time in my life. anyways, my psychiatrist had me prescribed with zyprexa. she said it should help with any paranoid thoughts or hallucinations that i had been experiencing. admittedly, i didn‚Äôt do a lick of research before taking them despite my psychiatrist recommending to do so. fml. fast forward six months, no more hallucinations and no more paranoid thoughts, yay! but i gained 60 pounds‚Ä¶ 60. i know this is so ‚Äòwoe is me‚Äô but the thing is, i‚Äôve always struggled heavily with my body image and self harm despite being thin my entire life. i weighed in at 120 before zyprexa, ended up at 181 after six months. so anyways i quit cold turkey after i realized just how disgusting ive become. then i tried to end my life but ended up with 14 stitches and inpatient treatment instead. to this day don‚Äôt leave my house unless absolutely necessary. i quit my job. i can‚Äôt stand my reflection. my depression has gotten a million times worse. i don‚Äôt hangout with friends or family anymore and i feel as though my social skills have plummeted because of this. my memory is always foggy. i‚Äôm always having to rack my brain to get words out properly. everything is terrible and i have no idea how to cope. 

i‚Äôm now 150 pounds but i still feel like a disgusting mess. i tried the gym but i feel like i don‚Äôt belong. i walk in my neighbourhood at night to avoid being seen. i no longer recognize myself and this doesn‚Äôt feel like my body. am i lacking the drive to just exercise and stop bitching about it? am i being overdramatic? (yes) but the reason i‚Äôm posting this is because i‚Äôve been looking for others who potentially relate or have advice on how to cope with weight gain due to antipsychotics. especially those who‚Äôve been thin their whole lives and deal with an eating disorder. also, i apologize if this isn‚Äôt the appropriate sub to post in. i‚Äôm not sure if i should be posting in a weight gain subreddit instead. any and all advice is welcome, thank you",1754572674.0,19,23,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1mkd99s,Could i be bipolar,"Hi! I 22F started sertraline 8 days ago. It started working ‚Äúinstantly‚Äù, like the next day. I know this is not a placebo. Before, my brain was very LOUD, and i was having a million thoughts a minute that I couldn‚Äôt shake if I wanted to, i felt like i was going insane. I was in a very deep depression and getting increasingly more thoughts of wishing i was dead which led me to going in for meds. Also want to mention: this deep depression was intermittent for about a 6 months, with gaps (day(s) week(s) of no sadness at all. Now, on the meds I have so much energy, I cant stop doing things around the house, have no thoughts at all and if I do im able to stop them If they‚Äôre unwanted.

I‚Äôve suspected being bipolar before, and i have very high highs and very low lows (off meds). During highs I spend crazy amounts of money and feel like i am a whole different person (self destructive behaviors), and feel like no one can bring me down. I also feel a log of pride/self obsession. I get very attached to people/things. I start new hobbies full blown and lose interest. I get extremely excited about new jobs and love them until i absolutely hate them and feel miserable. During lows NOTHING could make me feel better, I am crying a lot, angry, short fused. Lose interest in everything and everyone, get very disconnected from my loving husband.

I also take small words, actions, etc from people (good of bad) extremely personal (good or bad) and sometimes completely out of context/ in delusion

So far I have been on a high while taking sertraline, not dealing with any self destructive behaviors or self obsession, but feel over the moon happy and had a spending frenzy. I am really scared to find im bipolar by having a big crash from this. Does this seem like a possibility?

1mjozei,Seeking Tips (Trigger warning.),"To keep this maintained, I'm going to share some brief back story on my situation. Iwas diagnosed with BPD type 2 in late 2023. 2024 was a whirlwind of trial and error of medications and a therapist that was absent, and it hit a very slippery slope. Eventually, the year of my demise (2024) after Christmas, it was heavily settled that my ex of 12 years was completely out of the picture. The entire year, we had been separated and living together. Turned into me figuring out a lot about myself, and realizing it was a toxic relationship. H didn't treat me in a way that a person should be treated. 

I find myself blaming myself frequently, but therapy did instill that it was a very bad relationship, and I had to cut contact entirely. On the 27th of December, I ended up spending a week in the psyche wing. I won't elaborate too much on why, because it's triggering. I don't have a problem discussing anything about it, but for the sake of keeping this post within the rules... When I got home from the hospital, my house was empty. There was never a discussion. I moved to my sister's house, which is horribly crowded, and I dislike it, but I'm trying to move forward. A week passes, and I get a phone call that my father passed away.

This all hit me in a very short amount of time. My father wasn't a good man, and I'll avoid detailing that one as well. I've had a pretty tough life. I've uncovered a lot through therapy. Gained back memories. Diagnosed with PTSD, bpd2, depression, insomnia. During all of this, I was unable to work. I took an LOA from a job that could have been a career. I was doing okay financially. Lost the job, have been struggling to get my head back above water after draining my bank account to cover my father's services. It all fell onto me to handle everything. 

I've been working at another job that is significantly less stressful on me, but the pay is not that great. I'm doing what I can while also being like 3-500$ short on bills towards the first of the month. I just play the catch-up game, and i float by. I've mentally drained myself to the point of what seems like no return. I can't get back into therapy until I can sort out getting new insurance. (Enrollment periods are fun.) So I'm unmedicated on top of it all, as of last month.

I guess the real reason I'm saying this or sharing this is just for some help? What are some good ways you can properly turn your brain off so you can actually sleep? I've tried mostly everything. I'm willing to continue to try. The therapy coping mechanisms I learned specifically from EDMR, TAPS, they just don't really help me very much. What are some good ways to catch yourself when you feel an episode coming? What are good ways to keep yourself not exactly happy but content? Anything helps, any advice. I'm willing to try anything I haven't already tried at this point. I'm turning 31 in October, I don't have very many friends that reach out to me unless they want me to babysit sit or do their hair. I don't have children, I don't want children. Not that it's important, but I am incapable of doing so.

1mjk02y,I built an app for tracking moods and more!,"# Building a Bridge Back to Daily Life: One Developer's Journey from Crisis to Code

Last year, my world turned upside down. After experiencing a severe manic episode with psychotic features, I found myself in the hospital with a life-changing diagnosis: Bipolar I. Like many of us in the DBSA community, the hardest part wasn't the diagnosis itself‚Äîit was figuring out how to rebuild my life afterward.

The hospital discharge papers were full of well-meaning advice: track your moods daily, maintain a routine, complete your activities of daily living (ADLs), monitor for warning signs. But when I got home, reality hit hard. How was I supposed to remember to brush my teeth when I couldn't even remember what day it was? How could I track my mood accurately when everything felt like a blur of medication adjustments and emotional whiplash?

I turned to the app store, hoping technology could be my lifeline back to stability. What I found were apps that seemed designed by people who had never experienced the fog of depression or the scattered energy of hypomania. They were either too clinical (feeling like medical charts) or too simplistic (reducing complex experiences to smiley faces). None of them understood that on my worst days, even opening an app could feel overwhelming, but on my better days, I wanted meaningful insights into my patterns.

So I did what felt natural to me as an amateur software developer‚ÄîI built my own solution.

# The App That Understands

My Steady Mind: Mental Support app grew from my lived experience of bipolar disorder. Every feature addresses a real challenge I faced during recovery:

**Gentle Task Management**: Instead of overwhelming to-do lists, the app helps you focus on essential daily activities. It suggests simple tasks like ""take a shower"" or ""make the bed""‚Äîthings that might seem trivial to others but feel monumental when you're struggling. The app celebrates these small victories because it knows they're actually huge wins.

**Comprehensive Mood Tracking**: Beyond basic mood ratings, the app tracks energy levels and anxiety on separate scales. This three-dimensional approach captures the complexity of bipolar experiences‚Äîthose days when your mood might be stable, but your energy is through the roof, or when you feel okay emotionally but anxiety is consuming you.

**Meaningful Insights**: The app creates visual trends over time, helping you spot patterns before they become crises. It shows you data in a way that makes sense, not just numbers in a spreadsheet.

**Private Journaling**: Sometimes you need to get thoughts out of your head and onto paper (or screen). The app provides writing prompts specifically designed for mental health reflection, creating a safe space for honest self-examination.

**Mindfulness Integration**: Built-in breathing exercises and meditation timers help ground you when the world feels chaotic.

# Beyond the Technical Features

What makes this app different isn't just its functionality‚Äîit's its heart. Every interface element is designed with empathy, recognizing that some days, just opening the app is an accomplishment. The app doesn't judge you for missing a day or logging a low mood; instead, it gently guides you back toward self-care.

The app also recognizes that mental health isn't just about managing symptoms‚Äîit's about building a life worth living. It encourages social connection, creative pursuits, and self-care activities alongside the clinical tracking elements.

# A Tool Born from Understanding

Building this app became part of my healing journey. Each line of code was written with the understanding that comes only from lived experience. I know what it feels like to stare at your phone, wanting to track your mood but feeling overwhelmed by complicated interfaces. I understand the importance of celebrating small wins because I've experienced how enormous they truly are.

The app isn't trying to replace therapy or medication‚Äîit's designed to be a supportive companion on the journey toward stability and wellness. It's the tool I wish I'd had during those early days after diagnosis when everything felt impossible.

# Sharing the Solution

Mental health apps should be built by and for people who understand the daily reality of living with mood disorders. This app represents what's possible when we center lived experience in technology design. It's not perfect, but it's real‚Äîborn from genuine need and shaped by authentic understanding.

For anyone in our community who struggles with existing mental health tools, know that you're not alone in that frustration. Your needs are valid, your experience matters, and technology can be better. Sometimes, the best solutions come from within our own community‚Äîfrom people who understand not just what we need, but why we need it.

Recovery isn't a destination; it's a daily practice. And sometimes, having the right tools can make that practice a little bit easier, one gentle reminder at a time.

1misfju,You Cannot Treat Bipolar Disorder ‚ÄúNaturally‚Äù,"Edit: I‚Äôve seen some confusion about my main point, so here‚Äôs a TLDR: I‚Äôm not saying everyone needs to take medication. I‚Äôm saying that natural methods for managing bipolar disorder and actual medical treatment are not the same and shouldn‚Äôt be treated as equally effective. It‚Äôs dangerous to suggest otherwise. Both can play a role, but they aren‚Äôt interchangeable

Og post:
I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts asking about how to manage bipolar without medication or medical help. While I understand the sentiment, I‚Äôve also seen a lot of misinformation under these posts.

To start, I want to say that this is specifically addressing people who are certain they are bipolar. Most of the time, this means a diagnosis or a provider specifically treating you for bipolar disorder.

While I think self-diagnosis can be a helpful tool and starting point, I‚Äôve seen many times where someone who self-diagnosed as bipolar was not actually bipolar. Bipolar is comorbid with a lot of other diagnoses, of course, but it‚Äôs also a very specific disorder that can be mistaken for other conditions if you‚Äôre not specifically trained to understand those nuances.

There are physical conditions that can mimic bipolar disorder, such as thyroid issues, so getting a diagnosis or talking to a doctor is not just for validation but also to make sure you‚Äôre getting treated properly for the symptoms you‚Äôre experiencing.

Just wanted to preface that before I move on.

A disorder is something that disrupts a person‚Äôs ability to live a normal life and complete daily activities. When that definition is applied to something like a thyroid disorder or an immune system disorder, I think most people visualize it as something wrong with the body. However, with mental disorders, it‚Äôs often not seen that way. It‚Äôs often seen as something ‚Äúin your head‚Äù‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs not physical.

I think this leads people to believe they can treat it without medication if they just ‚Äúpower through.‚Äù There‚Äôs also often a misunderstanding about how medication works in the first place. Super simply: antidepressants don‚Äôt make you happy. They help correct the chemical imbalance that‚Äôs physically happening inside you so that you‚Äôre able to feel happiness.

Bipolar disorder is a neurological disorder. Disorders, to be properly treated, need medical treatment.

I WANT TO SPECIFY: It is possible‚Äîand actually recommended‚Äîthat you also do things like eat well, exercise, and get proper sleep. Of course these help non‚Äìmentally ill people as well, but these things affect the chemicals in your body, and therefore having routine and proper nourishment is very important to help manage your disorder.

Think of it this way: you wouldn‚Äôt tell someone with type 1 diabetes to just stop taking their insulin. Even if this person was eating great, very fit, and got 8 hours of sleep‚Äîall of which would help with managing the illness‚Äîif they stopped taking insulin, that would not be good.

This post isn‚Äôt meant to shame anyone, but with a lot of the misinformation and fear around healthcare that‚Äôs happening in the world right now‚Äîand also with how dangerous bipolar disorder can be‚ÄîI felt I needed to say something.

If you‚Äôre interested in how medication works or how we can literally see a physical difference between people with bipolar brains and people without, I‚Äôve linked a few resources here.

Be safe!

(Also, medication is a hard balance. Something that doesn‚Äôt work for someone else might work for you. Don‚Äôt give up, and don‚Äôt write off medication as a whole. I‚Äôve had very bad side effects and reactions to some drugs, and the meds I‚Äôm on now‚ÄîI really had to tough through the first few months. But now, I‚Äôve honestly never been more stable. I‚Äôm in my first year of getting my master‚Äôs and able to manage having a job! Don‚Äôt give up, and make sure you find a psych you like and who will listen to you! I went through five different psychs before I found the one I‚Äôve been with for years now.)

1miyx6j,Warning regarding Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) for folks with bipolar.,"Hello, lovelies. 

I hope you're well. 

I just wanted to put this out for anyone here who may have any autoimmune comorbidities because I was prescribed hydroxychloroquine for my psoriatic arthritis and after reading the side effects, I expressed concerns twice with rheumatology but they didn't help and sort of just brushed me off saying that everything has side effects (no shit, lol) and that most of their patients react well to it. 
I mentioned being concerned about the unstable mood side effects and I was basically dismissed. 

Long story short: I took one dose two nights ago and I woke up the next morning in hypomania and my condition (I realised this when instead of hanging up on scam calls like I usually do, I started yelling at the guy on the phone which is simply out of character for me when baseline‚Äîwhen manic, I yell all the time, haha) had been in remission for a very long time until I took this dose. 
But it says on the sheet that it can affect your mood and cause hallucinations, so not really surprising! 

It may not happen to you, but I think everyone should be careful with new drugs that aren't prescribed by psychiatry when you already have a mental health condition and really advocate for yourself. ",1754468179.0,33,36,BipolarReddit,bipolar

Before this job I was unemployed for a year after being attacked by a customer at my last (retail) job. This resulted in a mental health crisis- 6 month long depression and 6 month long manic episode- that lead to 2 hospitalizations in 6 months and a bipolar 1 diagnosis.

Well I couldn‚Äôt help but get emotional when she said that because what I heard and felt was ‚Äúit is easier for you to succeed than it is for her.‚Äù I started crying. She gave me space and when I collected myself I told her what had happened (I left out the bipolar part) and explained how it isn‚Äôt easy to come to work and put on a brave face every day. She was so compassionate and apologetic for what she said. Then we moved on! It was so easy! No shame!

The next day I lost fine motor control in my left hand and felt faint so I went to urgent care. The Nurse Practitioner there was previously a Psych NP and said it sounded like my nervous system had been fried by a brief psychotic episode. She still ran labs, which came back normal.

Have any of you had this?? I've never heard of a ""brief psychotic episode"" lasting only three hours. I used to have these type of episodes as a preteen/teen before I started on Abilify.

Less bothered by depression or anxiety. It still hurts, but not as bad. But it's so fragile. It feels like depression or anxiety is still right behind me about to pull me back. It's so strange. I had the strangest anxiety attack, I cried my eyes out to the point where it felt like my eyes would fall out of its sockets, chest was tight, but it lasted maybe less than five minutes.

In grade 9 I also think I had a couple 'happy' episodes as I called them. I've always had problems with anger but during these, people just irritated me for no reason so I would snap and then be fine again. My head races more than normal I think. I was more crazy, I would get in trouble for running around the house at night or singing and dancing making too much noise. I stumble over my words and speak fast with barely any gaps. I can still do my work despite racing. I wasn't overly confident but I was confident which I never normally am. One time I played in the back yard for hours until around 10 or 11pm. I also occasionally started things like deciding I would do all my school work and graduate a couple years early or signing up to a bunch of online courses. 

A lot the time the 'happy' ones seemed mixed in to depression. The depression has lasted anywhere from maybe 3 days to a month or three but the other ones only last like a day or three. I also find that whenever I have the 'happy' ones and seem to be doing a bit too well I always get depressed after.

The past two weeks I was depressed again and it got really bad on the weekend. On Sunday night I was suddenly really happy and singing and dancing around to songs. I've been isolating myself all year but I hang out with people at school, I talked a lot more, I talked more fast, I even walk faster, my head is racing, I'm happy and I've been running/jumping around but I have also snapped because people irritated me by doing nothing, I have been doing my work but can't listen and I have been going to bed at 12am which normally makes me tired all day but I've been energetic. I can't even believe that I could ever be depressed. The last time I told my psychiatrist about this mainly the low moods she said it's just because I'm autistic.

1mizdpx,Doubting my diagnosis,"Hello, 

I understand that only my psychiatrist can reevaluate this diagnosis professionally, but I also want to have some support and clarity from this sub.

The first time I‚Äôve experienced mania was after months of daily and heavy weed use and one alcohol binge towards the beginning of the mania. I ended up in the psychiatric hospital for a week. 

A year later around the same time the first episode happened I had my second manic episode, this was after a few months of being off meds and quitting weed around the same time. 
The reason why I doubt is because I think the weed use seems to be causing the mania and psychosis, or at least correlated to it. 

As of now I‚Äôm just over a month clean of THC use which is a miracle for me, I am back on an antidepressant but I‚Äôm hesitant taking my antipsychotic and mood stabilizer.

I was too young to understand difficult family situations. Today I am 31 years old. And in all these years, always wrong diagnoses, wrong treatments.

In these years of clarity he has managed to make me end relationships, impulses of anger, distance myself so as not to suffer and yet I have an enormous fear of being abandoned. When he wakes up he destroys everything, stability, relationships and as a result I have self-destructive behaviors that throw me into the abyss. They don't let me get out of bed for four days I don't eat. And then I have feelings of guilt that devour me, I have the judge inside me who gives sentences and I can't look him in the face..

1mivz8y,cant figure out if this shit is bipolar or hormones,"***TW BRIEF MENTION OF ED'S, PEDOPHILIA/GROOMING. DRUG USEAGE, SELF-HARM***

*ps, i might've used the wrong flair, im sorry if i did!*

So I (f, 13) do a lot of research on mental disorders, its a huge interest of mine, (i love different perspectives!) So I am aware on this most likely being mainly teenage hormones, but I do wonder how much I can get away with fucking up my mental health till someone says this is serious?

Back in April, I had like this full on crashout. I randomly developed an eating disorder for a month and ran a cult-ish eating disorder groupchat, where I absolutely shit-talked everyone into losing weight and following my insane habits, (I dont understand how i walked/paced 20k steps indoors for a week straight running off of 500 calories.) Eventually, I got kind of bored and tired of that and magically fixed my eating disorder in a week (I still track my calories but I dont really give a fuck about them anymore.)

June (I think, my months started to get blurry around this time), I got bored of my dad's absence and decided to set myself to get (technically) groomed on tumblr, for the plot..? I guess...????I had some roster of really old guys who encouraged me to do dumb shit and spent money on my interest in film logging (letterboxd i love you.) I completely decided I wasn't Christian anymore, I instead got into Hellenic Polytheism and started half-assed worshipping Aphrodite. Some guy I had an obsession with from tumblr (35, prob 36 now i dont remember) told me exactly how to take the drugs I had a fixation on, so again, ""for the plot"" i snorted my moms percs, had a panic attack, went to bed, got high again various more times. Had a religous crisis! I'd stay up until 3am worrying about religon and what happens after death, he'd relate to me and share his theories, which kinda made it worse. That guy then left me because I apparently had an addiction, and ""acted too unstable"" for him..! 

Again, memory loss, here's a few random things I did in between this time:  

1. I sent various photo's to strange really fucking old men, telling them every detail of my life (I had a lot of issues regarding physical/verbal/mental abuse from my mom, not actually towards me but towards someone I'll just be referring to as a ""roommate"" who overstayed her welcome by my.. entire life!) 

2. Snorted tradozone..? That i stole from my dog??? 

3. stole more pills from my mom, shes down like almost 10 in one bottle lol

4. picked up age regression from the 35yo that was really into it for some reason, I literally don't even care about that shit anymore but I was passionate before.

After all of that, I got with this other dude from tumblr (34, hes 35 now), he was diagnosed with BPD, ADHD, and CPSTD (i think). Despite it like being horrible in hindsight, dude was actually pretty helpful for my mental health, didnt really care what I got high on as long as I was safe, idk was kinda chill despite being like a literal predator..! Anyway, he ghosted me, I cried and woke up one day realizing I needed to get my life together, ghosted my friends for the entire month of July, and picked up journaling and some... fake peace, kinda? Thats where I am now..!

  
Before ending this, I figured I'd mention a few things I've actually displayed for my entire life, including before puberty, if that matters.

1. Anger issues. My mom put me in therapy for stabbing a life sized bear my dad got me with a huge kitchen knife, and displaying violent behaviors while playing, I also wanted to murder my dad, and wrote out a detailed plan on how to, when i was like 7.

2. Hypersexuality. I used to get off to random shit on youtube when I was like 4, lowkey had an addiction before I even knew what it was. I also really wanted a sugar daddy at 8 and wrote about it obsessively in my journal..?? I also used to lie about my age from 8-12 to do dumb shit with teenagers online.

3. Self-Harm. I was chopping it up when i was 11, till my mom found my cuts, screamed at me, went through my phone, blamed it on my friends, and constantly wrist checked me and made me put witch hazel on my scars. I also wrote a suicide note (which she found in my phone) and she ranted about how my discord friend got a longer paragraph than hers, the note wasnt finished.

4. Constantly-Changing Perception Of.. Life..? I converted myself to witchcraft and atheism when I was 8 and even went as far as cutting up my fingers for some dumb vampire spell i found online, despite being raised as Christian my entire life. I briefly changed my pronouns and went by a different name, though I dont exactly feel safe exploring that with my mom being lowkey transphobic and homophobic. 

With all of this being said, I'm not looking for someone to give me some online diagnosis, but I find it hard to believe that all of this is ""teenage hormones"" when people have perfectly normal teenage experiences, just a bit more emotional. I dont really know what the fuck is wrong with me, but I've detached myself from the entire experience to evaluate it!",1754457168.0,1,31,BipolarReddit,bipolar

I was taking depakote, latuda, lamictal, and prazosin. I am type 1 but my last manic episode was years ago due to medication.

It's my first day back at work after a long weekend and I am struggling. I feel like that whining sound that old TV's make is going through every nerve and I'm agitated. I feel like everyone is shouting and I'm a little shaky and I can't think straight. I don't know if it's withdrawal from the medications or if it could be the start of an episode so quickly? I'm not one to stop medications because I feel like they dull me, I'm fully aware I need them. So this is very uncomfortable for me and I can't reach out to the prescribing doctor.

I'm not looking for medical advice really, just...

Just awake . It sucks when this happens. Cause this is annoying and it‚Äôs never fun. LOL (not that it should be)  I‚Äôm kinda of at a lost of what to do. I do have a my therapy and psychiatrist appointments this week (on the same day ) It just feels like I‚Äôm slipping slowly into an episode which I don‚Äôt want. Cause I actually have things I want and need to do next week. Which is shooting my first documentary short film. I‚Äôm excited for it. But as I‚Äôve gotten closer to it.

The Depakote will be used for acute stabilization and then the Lamictal will be used for long term. Depakote will be kept as a PRN med from there. My goal for Lamictal is 300mg and Depakote 500mg.

My last full-time job was two and a half years ago, before I was laid off as tech imploded and the job market went to shit. I had some contract work here and there and started teaching a university design course part-time, but it‚Äôs been almost three years of survival mode.

A few weeks ago, I was told the course was being put on hold due to low enrollment. Freelance has been all but non-existent lately.

I could be making six figures a month from now, and I just got back from DoorDashing to afford groceries this week.

That‚Äôs been most of my life.

My family was ‚Äúlow income.‚Äù I remember a teacher in high school calling my neighborhood a ghetto, apparently not realizing I took a 30-minute bus ride to school.

I spent my early 20s going from gas station punching bag to cleaning toilets as a janitor at a manufacturing plant. Yeah, factory toilets. Use your imagination.

After a few years of that, I landed a software development job. It was a two-hour commute, but I jumped on it. As underpaid as it was, it was exponentially more than I‚Äôd ever made.

I was laid off after six months.

Back to struggling.

A year later, I was working full-time as an in-house designer.

This time, I was fired after requesting accommodations while adjusting to new meds. I disclosed my diagnosis and was let go the same week.

Struggling again.

I had a good run for a while. I moved to the coast, found a nice little apartment, actually started to build a life. Then that job started cutting hours, and I spiraled.

My apartment quickly turned into a pit, and I ended up moving back and staying with my parents until I was a functional human being again.

I‚Äôve been with my fianc√©e for three years. She met me when I had my life together, but she didn‚Äôt really get to know that version of me.

I need this interview to go well, but I‚Äôm also not entirely sure what it means if it does. We can pay our bills. We can stop struggling. We can start to build a life instead of just surviving one.

But, man, climbing out of the hole is the hard part. Suddenly having the mental bandwidth to realize how many people you‚Äôve lost contact with and how much time you‚Äôve let slip by while you sat in limbo. There‚Äôs a real comfort in being at the bottom.

1mgt6tu,Psychedelic experiences work,"

While availability/legality has only recently shifted, modern culture has now used psychedelics as a wellness treatment for decades now, so we should be seeing results.

I went nearly 30 years from initial onset of symptoms in my teens without a disruptive event, not even a speeding ticket, while being in stable longterm relationships and continuously employed, even developing mastery (I would humbly argue) in my vocation, before such an event occurred.

Admitting that correlation isn‚Äôt causation, I‚Äôm confident to say the therapeutical psychedelic experiences that I undertook with intent during a specific timeframe in early adulthood helped to heal and develop some of the methods I have successfully used to manage the disorder, even without a diagnosis, for decades before I formally received one.

A few years ago, I reached the limits of my ability to manage the disorder without prescribed medicine and formal therapy (I attribute the worsening of my bipolar to the events of the last decade hotboxing the disorder). I voluntarily admitted myself during a manic episode and was finally formally diagnosed Bipolar 1 Mixed (w/o psychotic features).

I tried a half dozen meds and as often is the case, the side effects were such that the disorder actually became harder to manage.

After trial and error with multiple meds, I‚Äôve found lasting success with a typical pharmaceutical and an atypical medicine as part my regimen in addition to rigorous adherence to a healthy lifestyle.

The benefits have lasted now decades since I last consumed psychedelics in decades. Anyone else out there years ago read McKenna, Leary, et al, and successfully do the protocols for lasting, transformative treatment?

Since more and more of us are turning to psychedelics for treatment, does anyone  have, albeit anecdotal and not scientific, longitudinal success stories with psychedelics?

I ended up stopping the medication and emailed my psychiatrist who is out of the office for the next 2 weeks. I was told I could see the other person in the office, but I‚Äôve been to them before and they were horrible. I am feeling intense pain. I feel bodily sensations of pain/dread/panic/severe depression. I cannot physically get off the couch or bed. I do work from home on a hybrid schedule and it is excruciating to get through my shift. (In tech support for banking and I absolutely hate having to talk to people all day. When your energy is depleted- having to take calls is the worst.)

I randomly start sobbing and pray for God to end my misery. The second I wake up, the horrific sensations and feelings start. It‚Äôs 10am and I‚Äôve been lying in bed since 8 in a lot of pain and anguish. I feel like Wellbutrin and its withdrawal has caused a lot of this. I am also struggling because the man I‚Äôve been with for a year has been silent, due to him having something going on he won‚Äôt share with me.

TW- SH, Suicidal Thoughts 

I (26F) was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 8 years ago. I have had two to three psychiatrists confirm the diagnosis and i myself know that something is messed up inside my head. While i dont advertise it, i dont particularly hide it either. I also have been indulging in SH for almost 11-12 years now. 

I was in a relationship with my ex (29M) for 2-3 years. In the beginning he was the perfect boyfriend material. He had my back always, we hung out, laughed, discussed everything and he was very supportive. I am usually the caretaker whether with family or friends so i was very hesitant when he was being there and doing things for me because honestly it was quite new. We were almost together everyday as we worked together as well. And then he got busy in his business (another job of his) and the change really hit me hard and i was finding it really hard to cope.

I started having really bad mood swings. And i was aware of this shift within me which honestly made me paranoid and worsened it. I was aware that i was losing it and it made me panic that i will be hated and abandoned owing to my own abandonment issues. I was also becoming very suicidal 

In the meantime a colleague of mine who was unaware of our relationship (we were keeping it a secret owing to us working in the same office) proposed to my ex. My ex told me about it and said he didnt know how to deal with it. I am not exactly a possessive type and since he himself told me immediately, i had no reason to doubt him. So i told him that it was better he is direct about rejecting her and not be vague as it would make her have her hopes up and honestly working together would just be messy. He rejected her and then showed me that conversation (i didnt ask. He showed)

I started to notice that my ex and the coworker who proposed were hanging out more frequently. Then i found out that my work gang were having the drinking parties that we all used to have and also were hanging out but just without me. He never called me or informed me. I began to feel like those drinking parties were more important to him than hanging out with me because i was alone thinking he was busy. And i just couldnt trust him after that. Like how am i supposed to know if you are lying or saying the truth.

Other things that bothered me would be how he  would keep asking me when i would leave but ask the coworker to stay longer. And this would be back to back conversations and made me feel humiliated and unwanted. But i was afraid to go home because i would be alone. I blamed myself for being repulsive. He stopped telling me that he loved me. He avoided hanging out with me. Avoided kisses. 

I was travelling alone for my exams to a new place and had to stay for a week and attend exams. He didnt call me once to check up on me. When i asked him about it he simply said ‚ÄúYou take care of everyone. You were the one guiding me during my exams too. Why do you expect someone to care for you?‚Äù It hurt so much that i broke down and cried. He said i was creating drama

Final straw was when i was working on a case he had delegated to me and toiling on it and decided to take a break and ran into my ex and the coworker laughing and getting lunch together. I dont know. It didnt feel right. We had another big fight with me asking why he was hanging out with her and giving hopes and him saying that i dont trust him. It ended with him saying again that i am the biggest mistake of his life and that it was a torture to be with me because of my self harming and mood swings. (I used to SH every other day but since we began to date i might have SH like 4-5 times in 3 years especially because i knew it disturbs him. I was also going through therapy so that my mood swings would be more manageable which he looked down on saying its all in my head and that i just need to work on it) 

I understand that i am difficult but i dont have expectations beyond quality time, reassurance and maybe a hug. Something to tell me that i wasnt alone. I am not downplaying my flaws. I am a horrible person for taking it out on another person but i was seriously giving my full effort to change. I even stopped talking much because anything i said used to annoy him. I dont know what i need to know. But based on the whole thing‚Ä¶ AITA?

Do you think it‚Äôs possible someone could live a traditionally considered productive life - college, career,  marriage, et al., by only employing ‚Äúalternative methods,‚Äù no meds?

Living well into well into adulthood with no legal trouble, not even a speeding ticket. Never getting fired and gainfully employed an entire adulthood. Never getting into fights or troll on Reddit/anywhere online.

Could simply just using healthy practices alone be enough to sustain a societally accepted productive life from an onset of symptoms in teens up until decades later into middle age before a hospitalization requiring meds?

I‚Äôve read that 10 percent of diagnoses occur post age 40 ‚Ä¶ how many are late onset and how many are people who managed for decades by lifestyle alone, blissfully unaware of a diagnosis or requisite medication until the other shoe drops and meds become necessary?

We have been talking about the efficacy of methods like psychedelics, meditation, journaling, therapy, et el., for well-being and since the middle of the last century so there have been millions now who have tried such things and have them work.

There probably aren‚Äôt many, but do you think there are people who have been able to manage the symptoms of a bipolar 1/2 for decades just through some of the ‚Äúself-help‚Äù that actually works?

Or will it always have to be diagnosis and pharmaceuticals from the jump if one hopes to have a happy life on one‚Äôs own terms?

I have a great girlfriend who I love dearly with all my heart. We're planning on moving in together soon. She's basically everything I've ever been looking for in a partner. My parents love her too, and her family also seems to like me very much.

I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt allowed

So I recently started a medication for adhd and it had the chance to cause a manic episode. I am taking a good antipsychotic so my psychiatrist wasn‚Äôt worried. For more context I have MCAS, if not treated it can cause agitation among other things. It can be managed using antihistamines, and during this time I stopped taking the antihistamines in pursuit of treating my insomnia. When I went up a dose on the adhd medication, I went into a manic episode. It happened slowly at first, but snowballed into intense suicidal thoughts. I was also very angry because of MCAS. Mania anger + MCAS anger is no good. This lasted for about a week and a half until I was almost hospitalized. I stopped taking the adhd medication and started taking my antihistamines. I am now feeling much better and generally don‚Äôt want to die, and I thought it was all over. Until last night. I kept thinking about how maybe if I just tried to kms then maybe it would work, or maybe I could at least hurt myself and just see what would happen. So while my partner was sleeping I went into the bathroom and sliced my arm until it bled about 11 times or more. These are pretty long and sorta deep cuts, but nothing life threatening or anything that would need medical treatment. I am so ashamed, I don‚Äôt want to tell my partner but it‚Äôs also summer and I can‚Äôt wear long sleeves forever. The cuts hurt as they graze against my sleeve.

1mf6jw8,How old were you when you were first diagnosed?,"Hey there! I'm a 21y/o woman who has recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder by two mental health professionals: a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Specifically, I've been diagnosed as of being of the rapidly cycling, dysphoric manic, kind of bipolar.

My family, while always aware of my mood episodes, questions ‚Äúhow [my] disorder has gone undiagnosed for so long‚Äù. I mean, I get their point: the symptoms were there all along, how did it take ‚Äúthis long‚Äù for the dots to finally be connected?

I think part of it has to do with how little correct information floats around regarding bipolar disorder: there are stereotypes, but very little that actually gets our disorder right, in popular media. Secondly, other bipolar people in my family have lived their lives undiagnosed and untreated, sadly. Thus being bipolar isn't something that the family is used to ‚Äì at least not by name.

I'm the first one to be diagnosed and treated. Not a coincidence that I am also in the mental health field!

So! I want to hear from you:

‚Ä¢ When were you first diagnosed, and, if you'd like to share, what was the story behind it?

‚Ä¢ Did your symptoms go unnoticed by yourself and/or others?

‚Ä¢ Did you, at some point, have an ‚Äúinkling‚Äù that you were bipolar?

1mfoppf,I should immediately halve the lithium after taking blood samples,"Hello,

my last lithium level was 1.08. 
No blood test was scheduled, the morning dose was taken at 12 noon. The doctor said it didn't matter.
The next day the nurse called and told me to halve the dose immediately. 
I called back, very unsettled and afraid.
Another blood test is not necessary. An appointment in 3 months is enough.
The previous value 3 months ago was 0.83
I drink plenty of water. It feels like it will float out again soon.

How high is my mirror actually? The family doctor is on vacation and the psychiatrist is no longer a contact for me on this topic. Where can you go to get a blood test?
Who believes you?
If adulterated, I could reduce more slowly.
What is the slowest reduction possible?
The thyroid medication would also need to be adjusted.

This happened recently and when my psychiatrist asked me if I hear voices, I honestly don't know what to reply because I don't know what kinds of voices she's talking about so I just said no. 

However, I have lots of instances where I hear ""sounds"" specially if I'm about to sleep. For example, if I stumbled upon a sports related content on social media, most of the time, those noises (people cheering, the commentators, etc) I will hear when I'm about to sleep or if I'm not playing music or if I'm alone. I've been experiencing this ever since I was a child. I always hear ""sounds"" (theme song of a cartoon, anime, video game sounds, people speaking in the background), not voices.

1mevjkh,I‚Äôm probably manic and I fucked up and now I‚Äôm in a panic,"I was discharged from inpatient a few weeks ago after a short (3 day) stay for mania w/ psychotic features. I don‚Äôt have a diagnosis yet but we‚Äôre working on it - I have my first psych appointment in a few weeks, but the hospital started me on a low dose of an antipsychotic on discharge.

I don‚Äôt think inpatient resolved my current episode (especially considering the hospital psychiatrist decided to discontinue mood stabilizers after the stay) but maybe brought it down a little bit, but it‚Äôs been on its way back up slowly despite med adherence.

After inpatient discharge, I went into a nasty mixed state while in a voluntary treatment program (living at a group home) and ended up leaving to go back to the ER, on advice from 988 because I was having active suicidal thoughts & intent, and that treatment program was explicitly not for patients with high risk of self-harm / suicide. The ER rejected me - well, two of them did on the same night - the first one very unprofessionally had the psych nurses basically tell me ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not gonna take you back to the psych area, you just have chronic suicidal thoughts, you‚Äôre non-compliant with treatment‚Äù (despite the fact that I literally left that treatment program to go back to the ER because a crisis line told me to), and pretty much told me to kill myself. The second ER took me a bit more seriously but ended up just giving me a safety planning worksheet and discharging me, means of suicide still in hand. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Anyways, I‚Äôve been home with my partners since then. We did some safety planning together like making sure pills, weed, and alcohol are locked up in a cabinet that I don‚Äôt have the key to, to help ward away impulsive behaviour. And that worked for a bit, until it didn‚Äôt.

I haven‚Äôt taken my AP in two days now. I rationalized it as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of it making me sleep for 12 hours a day‚Äù but idk how much of my reasoning for stopping it was that and how much is the illness. My partners still think I‚Äôve been taking it. I‚Äôve slept 4 hours (at most) in about the last 36 hours, now it‚Äôs 5:30am and I have no desire to sleep and I‚Äôve been jamming to music all night. But the last two days I‚Äôve been taking some of my ADHD meds in a‚Ä¶ non-prescribed fashion, rather impulsively and without telling anyone. I never had substance use problems prior to the period of time leading up to inpatient, so I think the mania led to the substance use, not the other way around.

(TL;DR:) Tonight my partners accidentally left the key in the cabinet lock and I snuck in and grabbed out a few THC edible capsules. I haven‚Äôt actually consumed any because immediately after this I felt disgusted by my actions. Now I‚Äôm panicking because I know they‚Äôll probably notice they left the key in when they wake up and they‚Äôll ask me if I noticed or did anything, and I‚Äôm stuck with multiple shitty options: lie to them (which I really don‚Äôt want to do), or tell them the truth, shattering their trust either way, and probably restricting my autonomy further. Not to even mention that I‚Äôve been abusing unrestricted pills, and also not taking my medication.

sorry for the long post, I have no idea what to do. I kinda just wanna run away and maybe that‚Äôll bring other issues but I won‚Äôt be dealing with this decision right now then.

You can read my old posts on my miserable journey to find something that really works, in which nearly all the medicines I tried, especially SSRIs and SNRIs, had made me sink deeper into the hole of dea*h created by the rapid and crushing depressive episodes. 

After months of being extremely suicidal on various drugs, things drastically changed on the day I dropped all the SSRIs (on my own), was put on Seroquel (100mg, then 200mg), and the day I initiated Lamotrigine - which has been the key player - on my own as well (titrated extremely carefully, no rash). 

The medical landscape in my country is really awful, I had to navigate all this alone to save my life, and I've successfully done that - 1 month without any symptoms, I've never felt like myself like now, things are so weirdly stable.

Final note : meds REALLY work, just be patient, the right ones have saved my life from the suicidal abyss, and they can save yours as well. Good luck.

1me90op,My psychiatrist is giving up on me,"This is more a frustration fueled vent than anything else. I'll try to make it concise. Any opinion/advice is very welcome.


My story:


I saw a therapist from October 2023 to September 2024. In August 2024, the therapist told me she strongly recommended me to see a psychiatrist because ""We don't have to wait until things get worse"".


(For more context, except for Ambien, all the medications I'm going to mention, I tried on the lowest doses available)

Early August 2024 I had my admission appointment. The psychiatrist I saw on the admission appointment, after talking a lot about several aspects of my life, leaned more towards bipolar disorder than anything else. On the admission she already gave me divalproate sodium (mood stabilizer) and Ambien (sleep inductor). 


Late August 2024, I had my first appointment with the psychiatrist that was assigned to me for my treatment. In that first appointment I told her that Ambien was working wonders for me, but that divalproate sodium was making me feel quite irritated, with suicidal thoughts, among other nasty physical side effects. She suggested I keep taking it and wait until next month when I'd see her again.


September 2024, symptoms regarding divalproate sodium are still the same. ""Let's wait a bit more because the body takes a while to get used to these medications"".


October 2024, literally all the shitty psychological and physical side effects got visibly worse. I never had such an horrible time on a medication. I saw my psychiatrist again. We agreed it was time to stop divalproate sodium. She switched it for quetiapin (antipsychotic). She also suggested that I might have a personality disorder, in her own words, due to the reaction I had to divalproate sodium. When I asked her which one, she said ""We'll figure out over time"".


I dropped quetiapin quickly. While I was on it, I could barely get up from the chair from how sedated it made me. In November I saw my psychiatrist again, told her this. She switched it for Clonazepam. Clonazepam worked to some extent, mostly to alleviate anxiety and to, I assume, polish the rough edges of my hypomania.


In December I saw her again, that appointment was probably the most normal one we had. No change was made. Although I was already feeling depressed but didn't mention it.


March this year was our next appointment. I was feeling more depressed than ever. I mentioned this to her. She prescribed me paroxetine (SSRI) (this while still keeping Clonazepam and Ambien because they work for me). Paroxetine felt great during the first couple of weeks, but then it started to make me feel agitated, generally more unstable, suicidal thoughts were back, and on top of that again undesirable physical side effects.


May. Next appointment, I commented to her what happened with Paroxetine. We agreed to stop it. At first my psychiatrist wanted to leave me only on Clonazepam and Ambien. I insisted that I was still feeling unstable and more depressed than usual. She prescribed me Escitalopram (SSRI). The first month and a half of Escitalopram was a dream, I never felt so great. It felt like I was one of the Powerpuff girls. I was hypomanic. After the month and a half I suddenly went from *insert textbook hypomanic behavior* to suddenly start to sleep more than usual and feeling apathic. 


2 months after I started Escitalopram. Another appointment. I asked my psychiatrist to up the dose because, even if I was feeling better, I still wasn't at a 100%. She upped it to 20 mg. Also, I asked what happened with the personality disorder thing, she claimed that she discarded that theory. ""I don't think you have a personality disorder anymore because this medication is working for you"". After upping the dose, the constant need for sleep and apathy became way more obvious. I would finish eating and I would fall asleep on the table. I would crash everywhere all the time. Washing my face? Skincare? Brushing my teeth? What is that? I only wanted to sleep. 


Early July I see her again. I constantly remark the fact that, despite everything, escitalopram made my depression and anxiety go away and make special emphasis on the fact that, of all the medications I've tried, it definitely was the closest to be the one for me. But yes, the abnormally constant need for sleep needed to go away. She said that I'm a complicated one, I agreed, though I think it would have been more appropriate for her to not make that comment. She switched Escitalopram for lamotrigine (mood stabilizer). I haven't been on it not even for a month, yet I'm super irritable, full of rage, and more depressed than usual. No positive aspects of it.


Today I had to text her to ask her for prescriptions and to update her on how I was doing on lamotrigine. I explained to her how I am feeling. Among the things she replied, she said ""Your treatment is a problem. Maybe we'll start slowly quitting on all the meds and you'll only stay with therapy. Because we've already tried with everything possible and nothing works..."". She also said in a voice message that she sent me that ""Your body clearly rejects all medications"" (shall I remind her that I'm on Ambien since last August and on clonazepam since last November and I had no issues with them?). Also said that ""I can't remember if I prescribed this one to you. But the only option we might have left is to start quetiapin"". 


All of this while there's still not a defined diagnosis, almost a year later, though from the very beginning bipolar 2 is suspected, even to this day. 


I know I'm complicated. But am I wrong to think that there's something wrong with this woman's approach? Aren't out there like many different psychiatric medications of different types? I've only tried 2 mood stabilizers, an antipsychotic, and 2 SSRIS. All on mono therapy. She never tried a combo, though I've read on here about many people who are on combos? I know therapy might help me a bit, but in my case I see it as something complementary. I don't think I'll be able to be stable off meds. This is so incredibly frustrating, and in those messages/voice mails she sent she sounded tired of the situation. Considering what she said today I think she's giving up on me.

1me47f6,A General Purpose Formula for Stability,"I‚Äôve been lurking in the sub for a bit and thought I would compile some thoughts. This is meant to be for those in the process of understanding their diagnosis.

1. Get diagnosed! Like actually diagnosed.

Don‚Äôt get caught in the trap of self-diagnosis. I went nearly 15 years on the flawed diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum. In reality I have BP1, ADHD, and PTSD. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be given a different diagnosis, or more than one. 

2. Build out a care team.
You can‚Äôt do it alone, and nobody wants you to! Your care team should be diverse and robust. A therapist, a friend or two, family you get along with, a partner, your prescriber, and your primary care physician. Even 988 or your local crisis hotline. Who are you meeting with regularly? Who can you call if you‚Äôre nearing crisis?

3. Find a specialized prescriber
While your primary can prescribe psych meds, I found that in primary care, I was given ‚Äúolder‚Äù meds that have historically been first line treatments. It was a lot of trial and error until I started working with a nurse practitioner that specialized in mood disorders. She put me on a newer med with much more tolerable side effects.

4. Talk with your prescriber about ketamine for bipolar depression.
If you look at the statistics, folks with bipolar spend the majority of time ‚Äúoff balance‚Äù in a depression. Many folks who have figured out their mood stabilizer haven‚Äôt been manic in a while, but the depression is still there. In my experience some mood stabilizers can have depressive side effects. This is where ketamine is a game changer. It would only be a good idea if your manic phases have been under control for a while. But damn, it is really helping me shed some old patterns and grow into new ones.

5. Progress is not linear. It‚Äôs a conga dance.

Sometimes I feel like I take two steps forward and one step back. Put that to music and boom you‚Äôre dancing. Just a thought.


Hope you all have a good day.

1mdpxpc,I can‚Äôt tell if feeling hypersexual is psychological or physiological,"I 33F have been dealing with feeling very stimulated, enough that it‚Äôs getting on my nerves. However I can‚Äôt really pinpoint what could be the problem. 

I‚Äôm diagnosed BP1. A decade ago I felt relatively hypersexual but it was different. I feel physically stimulated often, not always mentally. This heightened drive didn‚Äôt start until maybe 2 years ago. I was in a relationship that ended 3 years ago and my libido was kind of low because I had weight gain that made me feel less desirable. So we would maybe have sex a few times a month, and I‚Äôd sometimes masturbate but not much.  


Anyway, I was single until October last year - I‚Äôm now with my current boyfriend. We have an amazing sex life, usually having sex 2-3 times a week (we don‚Äôt live together so who knows if it would be more). Sex with him is the most satisfying I‚Äôve ever had, so I feel the most relieved after that. I only crave sex with him. 

The issue is I find myself masturbating so much and I don‚Äôt understand why. I‚Äôll feel stimulated while at work (I work a desk job). I swear it‚Äôs like if I shift in my seat certain ways it‚Äôs like a light switch for my clit. Then my mind is going. Sometimes I‚Äôm craving sex, other times I just feel stimulated and then I feel like I have to masturbate as soon as I can. I do watch porn when I masturbate but that‚Äôs it, I don‚Äôt have the urge to do so - it‚Äôs just what will help get me off. 


Lastly, I have various reasons I should have a lower libido and don‚Äôt. I have Graves‚Äô disease which is a thyroid condition causing hyperthyroidism, and I‚Äôve not seen one woman say they have even a healthy sex drive. So many complain they have lost a lot of their sex drive, but mine peaked when the disease started. My thyroid is now controlled and believe it or not, the hypersexual stimulation/behavior was way worse when my numbers were off. I‚Äôm on Lamotrigine, Wellbutrin, Vyvanse, methimazole, propranolol‚Ä¶so many meds that should potentially lower my sex drive. 


So that being said, how do you characterize hypersexual behavior? I‚Äôm just not sure what the root of the issue could be but I think there‚Äôs a good chance I have something physiologically going on too. ",1753929290.0,6,10,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1mdkjl2,Creativity Issues?,"I've been struggling with creativity and creative expression. Before getting back on my meds, I had so much fun with my writing. I had no problem creating and adding to written works. I had so many thoughts, so many ideas! Now though? I feel like I've lost my sparkle and crackle; I feel so¬†*flat*. I miss writing so dearly. I carve time out of the day to give myself time to write. I create so much space in my life for me to sit down and write but I just can't do it the same way. I feel so foggy.

Hypomania is not fun for me; I know it's destructive, but I so desperately wish I could feel a fraction of the creative potential I feel during those times. I'm just struggling with this sense of loss, which sounds so odd to say. I mourn that part of myself. I'm sorry if I'm coming off as dramatic.

1mdpcsv,Medication that helps with self harm?,"TW: Self Harm

Hi there! BP1 diagnosed about 7 years ago now. Been on mostly the same med routine with changes to my antipsychotic over time. Having a recurring episode(s) of self harm behaviors and it always leads me back into a depressive episode (or vice versa.) it‚Äôs been a rocky year with some mixed moments but mostly depression.

I told my psych as usual I‚Äôm struggling and to see if any changes are necessary. I know a lot of you are probably familiar with this feeling - what else do I try? How do I make safe changes to my routine?

I was wondering if anyone had experience with a certain medication or dose that helped with self harm urges? I am very aware that a lot of that work happens in therapy, and over time in my life it has improved, but in terms of a physical strong feeling of dissociative urge to self harm, and then followed by an almost addictive feeling following it, I‚Äôm wondering if there are even any changes I could make to my meds to help.

For context, I take:
Lithium 900mg (blood level was last .6 which made my psych happy)
Lamictal 200mg
Currently Vraylar 3mg (was risperidone, and before that was Abilify.)

1mdf4d1,paranoia in a mixed episode. Please help.,"Hi to the world out there. 

I think I have been in a mixed episode because of the heat. It‚Äôs really bad in GA. This time last year, I lost a bunch of friends because of a mixed episode‚Äî

My sleep is weird. One night regular next night, 9pm-3am. My mood swings are so intense they are beyond control and I hate it because it‚Äôs so unprofessional to be snapping at people. My concentration is really hard, I have a pressing urge to complete everything on my todo but my ability to focus to get it done is nonexistent. My libido is up and down, causing it to be really hard to control. 

But I think my most bothersome and troublesome symptom is paranoia. I am constantly paranoid my job is out to get me. I can‚Äôt trust anybody and it‚Äôs hard to tell if it‚Äôs my brain or they really are. I tried voicing my concerns and the admin team almost sent me home? 

I also have severe paranoia an old ex boyfriend is spying on me. He and I broke up a year ago but I am obsessively convinced he is watching me, either through my friends and family or physically, when a car is idling outside my work or we get a ghost call, I think it‚Äôs him. If my phone starts acting weird, I fear he‚Äôs watching what I am typing. We havent spoken in a year plus. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for some agreement, does this sound like a mixed? I don‚Äôt have any enormous energy changes but my mental energy is really strange, I‚Äôm just finding it really hard to control myself and emotions more than usual. 

My main question, when people get paranoia in episodes, it doesn‚Äôt have to be the FBI or police or something, does it look like just someone you know? Or would this be more reflective of anxiety?

I keep feeling guilty for everything I have.  I don‚Äôt have a job.  I have tried and failed at nearly 40 different jobs since age 13.  

I spent an entire YEAR in inpatient psychiatric facilities in 2014-2015.  During that time, I was approved for Social Security Disability.  That was 10 years ago.

I feel so internally guilty that I have income and I don‚Äôt work for it.  

I just recently moved into a different apartment.  On Section 8 Housing, where I only pay 30% of my income as rent.  This place is REALLY nice, and I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve it.

I‚Äôm just so ashamed of myself.  I don‚Äôt do anything important.  I don‚Äôt earn what I receive.

1mcvx89,Need advice from other Bipolar people in college,"So I am taking a summer class [math class for engineers] and I am struggling really badly, I need some advice from people that have been in a similar situation before.



First, let me explain my situation. I work 60 to 80 hours a week. My expenses are such that I need to work 60 hours a week to afford everything as I am in a lot of debt. If I work 60 hours, I can‚Äôt afford to eat, so most weeks I have to work more than that. I make too much to get SNAP or any assistance. I have to pay $1,500/month on my debt each month, and due to interest the balance doesn‚Äôt change.



I have been diagnosed with Bipolar, Autism, OCD and ADHD. I had to stop going to my therapist as I can no longer afford him. I need braces due to bad jaw pain, but can‚Äôt afford that either. Currently switching bipolar meds as well and that is screwing with me. A typical day for me would be working from 6am to 9pm [two jobs, thirty minute break between each], get home, eat dinner, shower, and then spend 10pm to 1am watching lecture videos and reading the notes for the next day. Then pass out at 1am and have to be up at 5am the next day.



Did I mention I am currently not living near my school? So I commute by plane to attend discussion, only when my work schedule allows it. So if I am not at work, I am flying to attend a discussion. For example today I worked 5am-2pm. Got off work, ran to the airport, flew to SFO [1hr flight] took the BART all the way to Berkeley [1.5 hr train ride] attended 1 hr discussion, took the BART all the way back, currently waiting for my flight back. Have to do the exact same thing tomorrow, I work at 5am and probably won‚Äôt be home until 1am.



Despite feeling like I am putting in all this effort, I feel like I am understanding absolutely nothing. I barely got the mean on the midterm. I can barely attend discussions so I feel so behind. Can never attend office hours. It takes me like 8 hours to finish the homework, and half the time I don‚Äôt even know if what I‚Äôm writing makes sense. This class has me completely defeated and exhausted. I feel like I am not made for CS and that I should switch my major. I feel like giving up, maybe I am not meant for college. It hurts because I am trying so hard.



Anyone else going through this? Anyone else completely confused in their classes, and still did well later on? Any advice?



Also, as I said I am flying back tomorrow after work. I was wondering if instead I should cancel that, and use that time to catch up on sleep and start the homework. Would I be making a big mistake? With this discussion I would have attended 10/13 discussions needed for a full grade by the time the class ends, and without it I would only have attended 9. This is 5% of my grade.",1753845676.0,4,5,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1mcbl5k,Am I just sensitive or should I get a new psychiatrist?,"My psychiatrist knew I haven't picked up my Xanax since June because I just haven't received my ID in the mail. And once I did get my ID in the mail (about two weeks ago), I asked about the Xanax at the pharmacy and they said they didn't see it. I was also out of Adderall and was generally feeling like shit so I didn't remember to ask for a new prescription (especially since I was nervous that my psychiatrist would get frustrated).

I messaged him two days ago telling him my suicidal thoughts were getting worse and that I would like to start some of the prescriptions that he wanted me to start soon (primarily lithium).

He said he would call me tomorrow (which was yesterday) and that I wouldn't need a new appointment.

I waited and finally around 7pm he calls, and he asks me how I'm doing. Around this point I'm doing a little better, but I'm still kind of emotional. I've been having suicidal thoughts all day at work.

He proceeds to ask if I have picked up the Xanax yet... and I tell him no, which I get is probably frustrating. He goes silent and lets out a sigh, and he goes ""you realize you have to ask them about it, right? Like you have to inquire about it?"" and I told him it was genuinely just a mixture of transportation and lack of ID, and the couple of times I did talk to them it resulted in them saying they don't have it anymore. He proceeds to just sound kind of... tired. He's sounded frustrated before when I told him they didn't have my Xanax, back when my ID wasn't expired and for some reason they just said they didn't see it.

And then he prescribed me the full bottle of Xanax instead of just the trial bottle, sends the rest of the prescriptions to my pharmacy, and tells me to have a good night.

I felt really bad after this interaction and by this point I was crying, and I went on here to ask if Xanax helped with suicidal thoughts, and then everybody told me no. To which I think I had a psychotic break, because I started bawling and my mind told me that he prescribed me Xanax because he wanted me to kill myself (because I've always envisioned killing myself with Xanax), and that's why he didn't prescribe me the lithium like he was talking about. A bunch of people on here were telling me to go to the ER and call 988.

I went to sleep and when I woke up, I felt more stable (but still emotional).

I'm not bipolar, but me and my therapist believe it's likely there is something of the sorts, maybe bipolar, maybe schizoaffective, that my mum has/on her side of the family.

I've struggled with getting good sleep since I was a kid, but since my teenage years it's been especially hard to stay asleep once I've had around 6 hours of sleep. I can go a long while in a day without sleeping, and I end up staying up very late frequently, but I always make sure (even when I think it's too late/early in the morning to sleep) to at least get 2 hours. 

I know sleep is a very important factor when you have bipolar disorder (or schizoaffective), and I just learnt sleep deprivation can be one of the first signs. Though again, I'm not bipolar, out of caution I try my best to be wary of the medications or supppements I take so I don't make myself more susceptible to symptoms/more mental health struggles.

Maybe after finding a good sleeping aid, I can advise it to my mum (who is very sensitive to a bad mood when she doesn't get enough sleep), and I'm trying to set better goals for my bodily and mental health this year anyway, so I thought I might as well ask.

My Mother passed away and I started to learn that my dad very likely falls in the cluster B category. Not sure if it‚Äôs NPD or possibly anti social.  That‚Äôs not really the point of this post though. 

I feel like my Dad may suspect that I‚Äôm not actually Bipolar but instead I have the same condition that he has.  I felt like he would try to help me by manipulating my emotions while my mom was dealing with cancer. It seemed like he was trying to get me to cry more or act in a different way than I was. 

I really resisted him trying to manipulate me because I was really angry that I saw him trying to do it.  I just tried to show no emotion towards him and saw that he was getting frustrated that he couldn‚Äôt get me to cry. 

I have no idea what he was trying to do or where he was coming from. I suspect that he was trying to get me to relieve some pressure somehow?  Like maybe he thought if I stored up my emotions too much I would explode or something?

Any ways. My question is this. Do you think it‚Äôs possible to store up an episode?  Like it could get worse if you tried to avoid it or something?  Personally I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works.

I have some periods that certainly seem like hypomania, and deal with incredibly deep dips of depression that seem to come on for reasons unrelated to BPD. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if I have BP. My question is, though, do you guys have any periods of stability in your moods? Off medication, of course. I really don't seem to have those periods of stability that are so common in BP - I have no baseline to swing from, really. 

However, I'm wondering if this is because of my BPD. I mean, mood instability is a huge part of BPD, and so surely it'd make sense to not have the baseline stability that most BP patients have. My mood is pretty much always low, but it'll be pock-marked with the typical BPD rapid shifting, and I'll get some moments of complete euphoria, or I can be insanely depressed for a few days, before I return to my ""normal"" low. However, it can dip incredibly low for long periods of time, where I'll typically plan an attempt, become quite non-functional, my SH will pick up, I'll isolate myself, etc etc. These periods aren't triggered by anything, in the way that my BPD mood shifts are - usually, I can go from rock bottom to cloud nine at the drop of a hat, based on my interactions with people, but these periods are not related to anything in my life, nor will they lift based on good interactions. On the inverse, I have shorter periods of what my MH worker believes to be hypomania, where I tend to be super reckless and impulsive in ways that my BPD doesn't usually involve (ie, my BPD causes me to be constantly reckless with my life, but only in these short bursts am i reckless with money and sex). I'll think some odd things, like come up with big ways to change my life, be convinced I can outrun speeding vehicles, etc. I'll stop sleeping and eating, and generally just be someone I don't recognise.  
  
The main thing with Bipolar that I'm unsure of is the stability that so many report in between episodes. So, if you have both, I'd be really interested as to what your moods look like? ",1753744079.0,2,5,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1mbsmjq,Thinking about switching to a cash pay psychiatrist.,"I'm partly seeking input and partly venting here. I'm in the US. Since 2018 I've been seeing a psych NP who is covered by my insurance and I'm not happy with her: she's not available more than every 2 months even if I'm in crisis and it honestly feels like she doesn't have a ton of ideas for how to treat me (I've trialed \~30 meds and have done ECT already + have co-morbidities, so I'm not an ""easy"" client).

I've been trying to find someone new for about 5 years, but I'm STRUGGLING. Every med provider I can find who takes my insurance either isn't seeing new clients, outright sounds like a bad fit, or has turned me down (usually either because of my hospitalization history or co-morbid eating disorder). I feel like I'm looking for a unicorn.

And TBH: outside of a couple of times when I was hospitalized, I've never had a med provider who was both reliable and felt like a good fit. It's always just whoever I have available who will take my insurance.

So basically, I'm feeling pretty fed up with this process. And I'm thinking about just saying ""fuck it"", bypassing insurance, and seeing whoever I want. But going from a $25 co-pay per appointment up to \~$200+ per appointment feels like a tough pill to swallow. I'm really nervous it won't be worth it.

**tl;dr:** Finding a good, reliable med provider through my insurance has been rough. I'm wondering if anyone has experience switching to cash pay and how that worked out. Was it actually worth the expense to see someone who didn't take insurance?

1mbbtl9,Small update to my situation,"[First post for added context](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1lovds8/psychiatrist_says_ive_experienced_mania_but_says/)

I had an appointment earlier this month where I discussed things such as my suspected manic episode and psychotic symptoms. Not much came out of the appointment besides being told I'll be getting another appointment with a more qualified psychiatrist (his words, not mine) because my case is 'complex'. It felt like they mostly cared about my hallucinations than anything else, while I was more concerned about my mood. Also would like to add that I've barely experienced hallucinations in the past month, and when I have they've been mild and fleeting, so they're not my personal biggest concern atm.

In the meantime while waiting to get another appointment I spoke with my regular contact wrt my concerns about my mood episodes and wanting to get properly assessed for possible bipolar or something related, since I've felt my mood symptoms have always been pushed to the side despite my regular psychiatrist himself telling me I've experienced mania. (If you haven't read my original post, my psychiatrist's opinion is that my existing diagnosis of schizotypal disorder ""overrules"" bipolar and therefore I can't be diagnosed with both. I don't get it, but that's how it works here, apparently.)

Most importantly, my contact (a nurse) spoke to the head psychiatrist at my clinic about my concerns, and while I haven't gotten a date for a new appointment yet, I've been prescribed lamictal and have been taking it for a few days now, so at least my concerns are finally being taken seriously.",1753695765.0,5,1,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1maus5q,How do I know if my lamotrigine dose is too low?,"I‚Äôm on 250mg of lamotrigine daily and it has been working really well. I‚Äôve been taking lamotrigine since late 2022, I was 18 at that time. I‚Äôm not asking for medical advice, but I don‚Äôt know if what‚Äôs happening to me now is normal or not. 

For some background my original medicine regimen was just adderall and lamotrigine for my ADHD and my bipolar disorder. Years prior when I was 16, I got a schizoaffective disorder diagnosis (turns out it was just bipolar 2 with bad OCD) by a practitioner who wasn‚Äôt trained to give diagnoses. This diagnosis wasn‚Äôt correct, even though I was distrusting of the diagnosis I always relayed that information to my new practitioners and since then I wasn‚Äôt really taken too seriously by a lot of mental health professionals I saw after. I went to a psychiatrist who gave me lamotrigine to start out prior to treating my ADHD since she didn‚Äôt want me to end up having a bad time if I was just on a stimulant. Both of these meds helped so much and I was good. 

I had to later see a new psych (early 2024) and she said I basically had to go on an antipsychotic even though I was okay and was for a while because if I didn‚Äôt, she wouldn‚Äôt give me adderall anymore. The antipsychotic didn‚Äôt do anything but make me gain weight and made me a potato all the while making my ADHD meds not work. Around this time I went through a major stressful event which led to me being in an extremely stressful situation till February of this year. 

Prior to meds, my baseline mood was depression and after a bit the original meds fixed that. But around the time that the antipsychotic really kicked in and I was pretty stressed from what was going on in my life. I began to more or less deteriorate and I upped my dose from 200mg to 250mg which helped me for a while. I got off of the antipsychotics in November of last year and I have improved a tiny bit from the effects of that but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too relevant here. 

Now to the main reason for this post. I‚Äôve been out of that stressful situation for a couple months. But my depressive symptoms are still creeping back in. It‚Äôs still fairly hard to get up and do things, it‚Äôs hard for me to find a reason for anything and I feel kinda helpless with the occasional self destructive thoughts thrown in here and there. My adderall helps with my ADHD symptoms and it feels like it balances my mood out a smidge but I‚Äôm not anywhere near the way I was before. 

Is this a sign of my dose being too low? I know some people temporarily up their dose of medication if they‚Äôre going through a rough patch but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôll work or what.

I have been on 200mg since 2020 for bipolar 2. 4 months ago the doctor increased to 225mg because I've been having more severe mood swings in the last 8 months or so(which is possibly related to the perimenopause, but who knows, it hasn't been studied much)

then at the beginning of this month, she increased to 300mg. I have not had a period yet this month. 2 pregnancy tests were negative. I typically have one around the 20th, and I did have light spotting that I assumed would become a regular period, but it never did. the week before my period I always have cramping, bloating, swollen/tender breasts.

1mahf7z,Think I'm [M21] spiraling?,"I'm not doing well right now. I was diagnosed both bipolar and ADHD in december and had the following main symptoms: excessive spending, masturbation/porn and weed consumption, and restlessness with not sleeping for 3 days after some stressful life events and got auditory hallucinations. Was started on the following meds: Quetiapine 100mg and titrated to 100mg Lamictal. Lowered quetiapine to 25mg because of the lethargy I felt all day so I take this to sleep.

Psych felt I was stable enough by May to treat my ADHD with strattera. Gave lots of physical energy, felt good, and after a month at 40mg went to 80mg. Felt like I was flying at work and I've started to speak very loudly, a lot, and rambly. Then I got sick with COVID, and had to stop taking my propranolol I take for high blood pressure I've had since pre-kindergarten so I could take paxlovid and it made me break my weed sobriety because the withdrawls from not taking the propranolol were fucking horrible and weed made it better, but it had ramifications for my usage as now I'm using regularly again and I don't know how to tell my psych that, it's embarrassing.

My pharmacist told me I could take strattera while I had covid but that made me feel HORRIBLE so I stopped taking it for a week. Consulted the pharmacist about it and he said a week later after I was feeling better I could take the 80mg again but when I did the side effects were too much so I went back down to 40mg but honestly I don't feel right. My brother is struggling bad with suicidal thoughts around his OCD and I found out that he was suicidal at this same time I got better from covid too. This was a month ago. He's leaving in a couple days since there's a bed available at the specialized place he's going to go to and he's going to be away at minimum a few months. It's made me really depressed, and I just feel a dark cloud over me all day.

I can't help but feel like I'm a horrible brother too. I should've been around him more this year but I've not been because I'm too wrapped up in my own shit and I've been started to isolate myself from hangouts with people, listening to people irritates me, hell I'm way more irritable in general lately and it bothers me that I am. Since I found my brother has gotten to his worst, I've spent a lot of time with him but I can't just help but think about all the times I was horrible to him growing up because I was. We've talked about that multiple times and he forgives me and we understand we were kids, but that stuff still eats me up. Feel like part of me is what fucked him up but I also think that's a self-centered thought so I don't' know to think that either.

He's said he never thinks bad about me, never feels bad about if I'm too tired to hang out after work or just don't want to do a particular thing,  and same goes to him and he knows that but it feels like he's lying to me. I feel like everyone is lying to me to be honest, because everyone tells me all the time about how they like me, appreciate having me around, how I light up the room. Strangers will tell me this shit too. But I feel like they're either lying or just don't know I'm not that because I'm not a good person right now.

I feel irritation listening to other people speak, being around other people, and generally just can't wait to be alone when I'm around others because I'm so irritated with how uninterested I am with just about ANYTHING right now. I feel super self-centered My day is filled with feeling very agitated and also very sad, when I'm not feeling bored anyway.

In addition to ADHD, I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

Sometimes I take a second dose of my Vyvanse in the evening to stay up at night to do work, but I'm never productive. It makes me hypomanic (only in mood, not in risky behaviors) and the relief from depression is hard to resist. Afterward, I obviously crash hard for two days, and my depression hits harder.

I'm afraid to tell my doctor or family because Vyvanse is my lifeline to fighting my severe chronic exhaustion. 

Even with steady sleep for weeks in a row, I wake up feeling like I was hit by a truck randomly at least half of each week. On those days, Vyvanse is the only thing that helps me function. Without it, I wouldn't be able to keep my job.

I try to manage my use of it but struggle with the impulse/temptation to take it roughly every 10 days or so to stay up all night. I'm aware of the misuse but fear losing it and having to face the unbearable symptoms which it dramatically helps me battle.

Any advice on what I should do?

1maa5lj,A question for teachers,"I‚Äôm a teacher and I have been struggling for years, though I got my diagnosis less than a year ago. As a side note, I‚Äôve known for a long time that I have CPTSD, and it was triggered by a horrible experience at a school several years ago and I was off work for a significant period of time. Since then, I‚Äôve gotten progressively worse with depression and struggled to maintain a full time presence in the classroom. I finally learned why and got my bipolar diagnosis last summer, and I‚Äôve been off work since November. In 6 years, I‚Äôve never fully finished a school year without going down to at least part time or ending up on medical leave. Having the bipolar diagnosis now makes sense, but we‚Äôre still figuring out meds.

I‚Äôve been working closely with my psychiatrist since November and it seemed like we finally got my meds figured out in May. So I was thinking about a part time September return. However, a new episode popped up and I‚Äôve been hypomanic for about a month now. (My psychiatrist knows, we‚Äôre adjusting meds.) She also added a diagnosis of OCPD, which unfortunately makes a lot of sense. It‚Äôs a lot to process and I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed. 

My therapist thinks a September return is not a good idea and I agree with her. But it‚Äôs starting to make me wonder if I can teach at all. Currently the thought of ever going back and managing a classroom is overwhelming and I‚Äôm not sure I can do it. But maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm feeling stuck? My therapist also said I might need to come to terms with the fact that I am disabled. Being saddled with three major diagnoses makes me wonder if I am unemployable.

So if you‚Äôre a teacher with bipolar disorder (especially if you have comorbidities), how are you functioning? How long ago were you diagnosed? How long did it take to figure out your meds? Are you stable? If yes, for how long? Are you currently on leave? Part time? Full time? Completely changed careers?

1maemeb,Frustration with some family & others,"So I've been in recovery for a month and just started lamotrigine last week after going through a terrible week and a half of depression (suicidal). I'm not diagnosed bipolar (unspecified mood disorder) since it was my first time seeing this psych dr and I'm sure the substance abuse history makes likes hard to diagnosis. Since then, I've been in what I think is hypomania (needing less sleep and naps, mind racing yet I'm physically tired, not emotional like in depression, nothing great happened and it's been a week). 

I tell this to my mom and our family friend and they both just say, oh no you're not bipolar. I don't live with them btw. My recovery friends say they all went through mood swings when they were in early sobriety. Yeah, that's definitely possible and I don't rule that out. However, my response to this med at 25mg seems odd to me. My moods are not changing daily or from another stimulus. I also feel the way these friends and my family dismiss my concern beyond substance recovery moods and possibly of bipolar (which the Dr even used the word possible bipolar) is very frustrating and makes me feel like I'm crazy. It's not like I'm going around telling them I'm confirmed bipolar II. By the way these swings and even mixed episodes suck regardless of diagnosis. It's just crazy cause no one lives with me except my cat and he can't attest to my moods so I'm the best historian.

I also will say, I have mixed meds with alcohol with the past but I am a social drinker and only drink about 2 to 3 times a year for office events.

I 100% do not recommend mixing alcohol with Depakote.

I will probably have to tirate down the depakote, and try something else as it seems to be affecting my work productivity and I work in a high paced environment where I work a lot of overtime and the body fatigue doesn't help with that but I will say I will not be mixing alcohol with meds after this past experience.

1ma5eic,Ritalin experience for ADHD while having bipolar,"Hi, 

I have Bipolar I and recently changed from 7.5mg of Adderall (after 2 years) to 10mg Ritalin, which may have not been the smartest timing because I was already in a hypomanic/bordering on manic state when I switched, and Adderall was also basically my off-label antidepressant for that time. (I'm treated for bipolar; the episode wasn't because of being unmedicated.)

I said some things in my elevated state that I felt guilty about and also stopped having that antidepressant feature from Adderall, which has caused depression to be added to the mix and now have been in a mixed state for probably a week, cycling quickly between moods and also having the simultaneous up/down feelings.

I'm going to see my doctor to switch back to Adderall because Ritalin is just making me feel worse I think. I switched because I was having trouble focusing and my doctor said that people with bipolar can often take more Ritalin than Adderall without risking elevated mood, though it would be a trial and error thing because individual genetic factors are also major influences.

**My main question is**, if you have been on Ritalin for comorbid ADHD, did it cause you to have uncomfortable depersonalization/derealization/dissociation feelings? Those feelings often come with mixed states for me (as well as heat + it's summer); like my brain is saying ""this is too much, I can't be here"", but I notice when I take even a small amount of Ritalin (even 5mg or 2.5mg) it gets amplified even more. If I go a day without the Ritalin, it's not too bad but Ritalin guarantees it.

Or, did Ritalin not work for you in another way?

It's frustrating because I'm a university student in the home stretch/going into finals of my semester, and wish I just stayed on the Adderall but medicine changes are always just trying to see what works and what doesn't. I learned my lesson to not mess with things though in a busy semester and when already symptomatic lol

1m9m7eg,Anyone relate more to the ‚Äúatypical‚Äù bipolar presentation?,"I checked out the Tracey Marks video comparing classic vs. atypical bipolar. It opened my eyes and felt validating. 

I started feeling depressed and irritable relatively early in life. From age 9 I was stressed and suicidal in episodic spates that didn‚Äôt feel completely resolved when they ended, just a pall after a nuclear blast. It didn‚Äôt help that I lacked social awareness and skill and couldn‚Äôt have friends, plus I was stuck in a strict and spirit-crushing Catholic school environment. 

In my mid-teens I pursued passions obsessively in a manner that could‚Äôve been viewed as hypomania, but since I actually discovered things, I hesitate to pathologize the experience. 

I did go through some euphoric manic episodes in my 20s, but I believe that was triggered by a horrible antidepressant. I feel most of my episodes, psychotic and not, have had mixed features. Suicidal ideation was my most concerning symptom, wherever they landed. 

Moreover, my family history doesn‚Äôt gel with decisive bipolar. There‚Äôs mental disturbance, sure, and plenty of denial, but not necessarily bipolar. 

As a strongly hypothesized autist (diagnosed in adulthood by a shrink but I‚Äôd argue not with rigor), I think my weird vibes baffled professionals for a long while, anyway.

It makes me wonder if those two presentations‚Äîclassic and atypical‚Äîare really the same disorder at all. 

Counterpoint: I was indeed most helped by lithium. Dr. Marks says atypical presenters are better helped with anticonvulsants plus next gen APs. Joke‚Äôs on me because I can‚Äôt take lithium anymore due to kidney compromise, so I maintain as well as I can on lamotrigine and abilify. ",1753510854.0,19,8,BipolarReddit,bipolar

My psychiatrist is overseas right now, I met with her PA last week. She wanted to double my antipsychotic to help with my depression but decided to raise my other medication instead.

1m9z1qu,Challenge of having hyperthymic temperament and being BP1 is knowing when stable crosses into hypomania.,"I‚Äôve been stable for a couple months now after a brief depressive episode that we managed with increasing my lexapro and lowering my Risperidone. I was diagnosed BP1 about 17 years ago but my default personality/mood is high functioning and goal oriented and it looks like hypomania despite being fully stable and sane. 

I basically have the ‚ÄúCEO‚Äôs disease‚Äù bipolar and am a highly compensated corporate attorney. My hypomanic episodes look like I‚Äôm on crack though and my manic episodes look like I‚Äôm very ill and can be euphoric but also paranoid and psychotic. But I typically manage the upswings well and keep it from getting too extreme. I mostly just look energetic and upbeat and personable. 

A few weeks ago I got back into running for the first time since my surgery at the end of March and am back doing marathon training. I was running 4 days a week and lifting 3 days a week before that surgery. I also noticed tons of motivation and goal oriented thinking and behavior as well which had diminished with the depression. Also increased religiosity (church every Sunday; increased frequency of praying; bought a new Bible). 

This week I started to wake up early without reason which is always a sign of things changing with my mood. Yesterday I woke up at 4am and just didn‚Äôt feel like sleeping any more so I got up and had coffee and waited for my kids to wake up. Another sign of change (not sleeping because you don‚Äôt *feel* like sleeping). Today I made myself go back to sleep. 

I think a big part of it is that I just finished a job search and my last day of my current role was yesterday. So the relief and the change is probably impacting my mood. But because it‚Äôs hard to differentiate between my normal, non-depressed state and hypomania, I have to just pay attention so that we can adjust the lexapro downwards and/or Risperidone upwards if necessary. 

My wife and mom have already commented on these changes independently and I am open with them. I booked extra therapy sessions (weekly now) and even had a Saturday session today as well. I plan on channeling the energy in a healthy and productive way by focusing on my health, fitness, family, faith, and new job, while maintaining balance to the best of my ability.

I've been on lamotrigine 50mg for 9 days now and the irritability couldn't be more evident. I just need to think about a relatively small thing that bothers me and that's enough for me to start to smack things (or at least want to). Today I went to pilates and I was so fueled by rage that exercises that usually are quite difficult for me to do felt like I wasn't doing anything at all. I left the class at 9:15 PM (that's the time it ends) and I went for an unusual fast walk/almost run around the city because I need to discharge all this physical energy fueled by rage I'm having. I'm currently having a beer to numb myself so I can stop feeling like this.


I'm supposed to text my psychiatrist for prescription and update her on how things are going (and if everything's going well her intentions are to up the dose to 100mg) on the 31th. My next appointment with her is on September 1st. I'm genuinely considering not taking it again. Meaning that I potentially won't take my next dose, which is due in 5 hours.
I have Ambien for sleep and Clonazepam in case I need a ""crutch"". Even if it takes a while, I'm having a bad feeling about lamotrigine. It is giving me Vietnam flashbacks to the time I tried divalproate sodium. It made me quite aggressive and uneasy. That one definitely did the contrary of stabilizing me (and I even took that one for almost 3 months). I'm starting to believe that I'm one of those people in which mood stabilizers only induce rage and more instability.

I was at ill last year with psychosis and my psych prescribed me 800 mg of Quetiapine XR. I was prescribed this for about 2 months or so before it got cut down again. They said it was because my delusions and depression wouldn't go away.

I think it was too much because I weigh like 50 kg.

But since that dose, I've just had these severe memory issues. I was a very fast learner before and I can't learn anything new. It just doesn't stick after a couple of seconds even. I don't think it's normal to experience such a drastic change in my cognition like this.

I can't form new memories and I feel like that's unusual; even when I've been on seroquel before I've still been able to remember things.  I also have these weird holes in my long-term memory. I can't even remember songs that I used to love. 

My doctor said I was prescribed far too much for my size and weight and that it's kind of like an overdose.

1m8tg9u,Some retrospect,"Hey all, I'm new here and navigating my way through my mid 30s with a current working diagnosis of unspecified mood disorder (first time seeing a Dr last week about mood specifically) so it makes sense. I was prescribed lamotrigine for this. I have been in a 12 step program for my drug/Alcohol and sex addiction. All this is pretty new.

I have been looking back at my life and since reading many stories here as well as online research, I've started to really question things. I was diagnosed with Adhd and some ocd when I was in 3rd/4th grade. I was given Ritalin for the adhd and Prozac for depression (suicidal ideations). Since high school, I started sneaking out and so began my sexual escapades. I never drank or did drugs until after college. Once those were combined with sex, is when things spiraled. I always thought most of this impulsivity and trust issues and fear of abandonment were due to adhd and being adopted. I can recall that in my moments of heavy sex and drug usage, I was always very ""up"" I would have bouts of this and then periods of depression and general isolation. I just thought this was a normal cycle for people. I never was manic or hospitalized so I never thought bipolar and even looked up cyclothtmia as that made sense to me. I had periods of not being overly up and definitely not depressed. 

Fast forward to now where all the sex and drug use plus some pretty traumatic events and I think it's only made the moods swings worse and more prolonged. It's sort of been the chicken  or the egg sorta thing too. Was this always a thing thst was just seen off as anxiety and depression? Was my irrational anger and rage just me or part of the disease? Hard to tell. I just know that now, in my (somewhat clear) and 2 week sober mind that it seems like things are starting to make sense after seeing the Dr. I know a lot of my AA friends say this is just part of recovery but I just feel like it's more and has always been more.

1m8m3ze,"F*ck it, I'm not guilty and I don't care (LONG)","I stopped feeling guilty for the things I did and said during my manic episodes. Even though they damaged my relationships and reputation because people interpreted me as malicious and driven by poor character, I know otherwise. I think it's important to let go of guilt and want to speak on how this crucial step is denied or shamed out of people with bipolar even by others with bipolar.

During mania, I genuinely believed my psychotic delusions and hallucinations even the ones that gave a basis to harm others. I had no awareness that I was being harmful and in some cases felt I had to protect myself and others by resisting THEIR evil. I felt victimized and terrified legitimately and responded accordingly even if that was incorrect, and I in some cases was actually wronged in some way and know some people who legitimately abused and traumatized me were only able to get away because they used the fact that any part of what I said and thought was out of alignment with reality and damaged my credibility to deny everything I saidnand thought -- even when I have proof. 

I wasn't medicated and couldn't have been because during years of manic cycles I wasn't properly diagnosed and no one sent me to the hospital. I didn't do and say all those things to be evil, to hurt other people's feelings, or because I'm randomly and hatefully aggressive. I was terrified, defenseless, and alone in my own mind either as a victim with no chance of escape against a massive conspiracy (depressed persecutory delusions) or a hero who had to seek vengeance and save the world from evil (manic episode grandiosity and paranoia). When people reacted by trying to ""hold me accountable"" and spread awareness that I was a ""bad person who could never be trusted"" and cancel or punish me before I was diagnosed or medicated it only validated my delusions and I learned and changed nothing because neither of those things meant anything when I was still not medicated or stabilized. 

A truly bad person would be answerable to the opinions of others and see a benefit to conforming to expectations, at least by HIDING what they are being shamed for. I didn't because I wasn't just a bad person making conscious decisions to ""do evil"", I was an insane woman who could not possibly change my impact on myself and others until I got HELP -- not 'held accountable'.

Plus, if I were to believe it was because of me being a bad person and not because of bipolar (even though all those behaviors magically stopped and I magically experienced embarrassment, guilt, remorse, and grief over just how much I hurt myself and others and understood their perspective without blaming most of them even though they hurt me when they don't understand) I would not be taking medication or vigilant about monitoring myself and remaining in treatment without changes or interruptions. If it's because I'm ""bad"" with no correlation to bipolar then instead of monitoring myself and interpreting irritation, rage, unfounded suspicion and pre-emptive hatred and despair about other people and situations and a compulsion to prevent or fix or avenge imaginary wrongs, and being argumentative all as part of my fundamental nature of being a ""bad person"" coming out and not as signs of mania. So I wouldn't be able to prevent myself from having another manic episode as effectively because I would still be attributing things to my character and trying to control it by raw-dogging ""fixing myself"" and repetitive cycles of shame and guilt instead of doing what it logically takes to prevent bipolar from hurting myself and others.

I think people with bipolar needlessly apologize for their existence and try to destigmatize by reassuring outsiders that people with bipolar aren't bad people (and catering to the false moralistic assumption that bad behavior during bipolar is due to being a bad person because of the reductive logic that only bad people do bad things). I think this is derivative of puritanical logic that is internalized self-policing about wrong emotions and wrong thoughts and truly believing that a person's character is all or nothing and that they will always be a ""bad person"" (damned to hell, but without the explicit religious context even though it's derivative of religion as part of cultural influence) forever and has no incentive to change nor can nor should anyone ever trust, forgive, or love them which leaves them with no way to recover or become a functional and non-harmful member of society which thus leaves them to be an outlaw and get past the point of caring whether they harm themselves or others because they are punished either way. It also denied the reality that behavior is driven by the brain and the psyche and neuroscientific evidence shows a difference in brain chemistry and structure for people with bipolar disorder particularly during episodes when we are truly a) not functioning like anyone with neurotypical brains and cannot be culpable because we aren't even able to perceive, interpret, or interact with the world the same way as they do and b) not functioning like we would be even if we have bipolar but weren't in an episode, meaning we literally physically are not ""ourselves"" when in the grips of mania or depression. 

Knowing that didn't make me stop feeling bad about how I hurt others or take away the understanding of why people hold the beliefs they do about me. It didn't make me decide that it doesn't matter whether I harm others and just decide I can do anything and shouldn't face any scrutiny or consequences. Actually since I'm not a ""bad person"" and simply am someone who was not in treatment for bipolar disorder I just lack a desire to do anything like what I did back then and don't relate to it because it literally isn't ""me"", it was a tragic reflection of how bipolar disorder impacted me and my behavior. Also, people without bipolar disorder harm people all the time for no reason beyond their control and the narrative of ""that's no excuse"" or ""don't hide behind it as an excuse"" or ""well other people with bipolar diagnoses don't all do bad stuff so anyone that does is just a bad person"" ignores the truth that we actually don't need an excuse and whether someone with bipolar does something wrong isn't a moral commentary on their character as much as people who lack a REASON for what they did that is actually medical and (unlike people with bipolar) only feel bad they were caught and about the consequences and would not seek treatment as a result of becoming aware they had harmed others (I did), or feel any guilt or remorse or dedication not to continue when they were equipped with the ability to make that choice (I did and many people who recover from bipolar and stop harmful behaviors do).

This post is just a reflection about liberation from guilt as a part of healing bipolar and actually recovering and becoming functional and non-harmful to oneself and others. I feel my experience isn't reflected in people with bipolar who impose the same moral commentary as people without bipolar do even though it really shouldn't be taken as a relevant or legitimate perspective because those people don't have bipolar disorder and also aren't medical doctors either. So their perspective about mental health and how it drives behavior is driven by ignorance not by truth. I even have the support of clinicians in terms of me not being responsible because I was clinically insane and people who are medically insane (not just vaguely ""mentally ill"" like depressed or anxious or something**) cannot be considered responsible ans don't need to be punished nor does society benefit from trying to punish them. So I don't understand why people with bipolar feel the need to constantly internalize and impose stigma and shaming instead of just healing and wanting healing without judgement or moralistic commentary because my experience is that I didn't start to change my life and my behavior until I let go of moralism and shame.

* Even on medication people with bipolar cannot control or always contain our polarities which is why we would need constant access to treatment including emergency medication changes. Episodes can come on and be too powerful for the medication that would otherwise stabilize you if not for a powerful change in polarity or something bigger than what you were in when you started a dosage of a medication, which might pass leading to needing a lower dosage. We are not truly not in control, we are just doing our best to ride the wave without drowning or dragging anyone else down into the water.

** I'm not trying to reduce anxiety or depression to non-issues because depression is a part of bipolar and I also have anxiety that has been debilitating in the past and fueled my paranoia and delusions and self-destructive behavior beyond the power of words to describe. I believe anxiety can drive psychosis and drive people to insanity but someone who struggles with these things don't necessarily have a medical disorder causing them and also don't necessarily become clinically insane to the point of not being connected to reality at all or unable to safely interact with and navigate the world. People with bipolar are actually more likely to commit suicide than people with depressive disorders that don't include mania because we are objectively worse off. It isn't the suffering Olympics, it's just recognizing bipolar as objectively a more life threatening and medically serious disorder than other ""mental illness"" that people lump in with bipolar when they make moralistic comparisons and commentary. It truly is not the same or close to the same level. ",1753406457.0,5,5,BipolarReddit,bipolar

It's a lot of work I agree and now I'm fine but for the future it might be helpful.

I always wanted to stay away from the anti-psychotics... But she makes a point- I literally cannot hold down a job (fired 10 times) and I am about to start a new job finally and my manic mess has been so destructive lately. She thinks overall, in a lot of ways, this will be helpful and lamictal is really if you are already stable in life.

I never thought I would ever be the way I am now and I am very proud. It‚Äôs been really hard to be the person I am today and a lot of constant work and effort. . I take Lamictal. I started taking it in 2023 for severe depression. Like I was a brain dead zombie and I just wanted to die and slept 24/7 and couldn‚Äôt function. When I started taking the Lamictal I was like wtf why do I feel like this. And that day then turned into a week and then a month and a year and to now.  I am not really that depressed and suicidal and doing really well. I was becoming really depressed again and they upped my dose of 200mg to 225mg and it worked. (Something I feel a bit conflicted about bc of my views of the psychiatric industry but that‚Äôs off topic.) I read that Lamictal is not usually prescribed and works just for depression and as a mood stabilizer typically for depression yet works so well for me.

I am worried about developing bipolar disorder and especially when I am finally for the first time since a kid escaping the crushing depression and mental issues I used to have.

Fear of abandonment: I‚Äôm terrified that the people I love will leave me. for the most part, it‚Äôs ALWAYS romantic interests that leave me. I think my longest relationship has lasted like 2 months and I‚Äôve only been in like 5.

Paranoia: when I‚Äôm having a bad crying sesh and it gets too intense, i completely space out once I‚Äôve stopped crying. I just keep thinking, this cannot be real. I cannot live like this. there‚Äôs something wrong with me. I sometimes hear voices too during this spacing out. Yelling at me or just calling my name. I literally think I‚Äôm going crazy. Then I get sleepy üò≠

Mood swings: this is BAD. I go from happy to crying over literally nothing!!! to be fair, I‚Äôve always cried at the smallest things ever since I was little. like for instance, maybe 2 years ago I couldn‚Äôt open my tub of Icecream cause it was on too tight and I had to ask my dad to help me while crying because it frustrated me so bad for some reason üò≠üò≠

Anger: if it‚Äôs not BPD, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs some part of anger issues. The slightest things set me off for some reason, but I‚Äôm good at holding it in till I‚Äôm somewhere private most of the time. The most frustrating thing in my life is my grandfather. He‚Äôs‚Äî such an insufferable asshole. He uses the excuse of being ex military to be verbally and mentally abusive towards me. for atleast 7 years, he rarely talks to me normally. He‚Äôs always yelling about fucking something and asking what‚Äôs wrong with me. Mf I DONT KNOW EITHER DONT ASK ME?? anyways. He‚Äôs calmed down a LITTLE bit with it. I think he‚Äôs realized he‚Äôs retired and needs to chill the fuck out. I don‚Äôt care though, it still angers me whenever he does anything. He could call my name to ask me what kind of cheese I want on a sandwich and it still Pisses me off. I still need to control my anger though. I often storm back to my room and throw stuff around and make a mess of my room then get sad that I have to clean it up again‚Ä¶ also whenever he wakes me up in the morning he never knocks like a normal person??? He bangs on the fucking door like a weirdo and it gives me a migraine first thing in the morning and he wonders why I‚Äôm fucking moody for the rest of the day. I literally could rant about this old piece of dust forever, but I just wanted to make a quick post.

ANYWAYS. Thoughts? Is it just depression and anxiety, some other stuff, orrrrr‚Ä¶. a sliver of BPD maybe? I‚Äôve gone through some other stuff that isn‚Äôt mentioned here, but uh.. not the right place to talk about that stuff I think?? Honestly I could write a lot more examples of stuff I go through but it‚Äôs so hard to describe it. Mostly the emotional part. I feel everything way too deeply. I love too hard, I feel anger too much, and sadness always feels like I‚Äôm crying over someone who died. It‚Äôs exhausting.",1753229400.0,0,7,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1m67ezx,how im feeling; how do i get out of this,"Hi bipolar reddit, back again.

This disorder is killing me, I don't know if i've just come out of some hypomanic-euphoric episode or if I'm just really depressed for no reason. My lows are random, but usually the ones I'm feeling right now are after a manic break, though, I didn't notice one, and no one else did. I didn't spend money, didn't have any 'big' feelings, I didn't feel out of order, I didn't stop taking my meds, no typical mania stuff. (could give more examples but im lazy right now sorry)

I don't know what it is, I just can't get out of bed, I want this day to end only to fall into night where I lay wide awake thinking of how empty I feel. I don't want to go back to the hospital, but it's crossing my mind. I haven't spoken to anyone for days, but to be real, no ones spoken to me either. I haven't fallen into any bad habits, but it's becoming tempting. I don't want this for myself, or for anyone else.

My days right now are really just consisting of music, writing, family. I really want to get out of this. Does anyone else relate? Does anyone have weird things that help them out of this depression?",1753168280.0,5,2,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1m63o98,Checking into a ward voluntarily,"**TW: This post contains heavy mentions of suicide and self-harm.**

So for some context, I‚Äôm Bipolar (Bipolar I with Mixed Features), but I‚Äôm currently waiting for an official diagnosis.

Another thing I‚Äôll say is that I‚Äôm not usually the type to self-diagnose... but I grew up in a family with people who *are* diagnosed with

‚Ä¢ Bipolar I Disorder
‚Ä¢ Schizoaffective Disorder
‚Ä¢ MDD, Autism, ADHD, and Anxiety
‚Ä¢ Epilepsy

I‚Äôm also going to share some background on who I am to build a better picture. Feel free to scroll to the end if needed.

Growing up, I had a chaotic, unstable childhood full of violence, substance abuse, and just straight-up madness.

When I was 6, my brother got sectioned after a suicide attempt. Everyone said, ‚ÄúIt was the weed!‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd be fine if he didn‚Äôt smoke!‚Äù He was a violent criminal, yeah, but to me, he was compassionate. He‚Äôd been through so much hell.

My sister (who‚Äôs schizoaffective)... watching her downfall was tragic. It happened fast, and it was terrifying. She was someone I *looked up to*. She was working young, making money, laughing, living... but I noticed, even as a kid, that something changed. She became unpredictable and confusing. No one helped her. Everyone just punished her or pushed her away.

She had been struggling mentally for years. I remember being on my DS when suddenly she got super religious out of nowhere. As a 9-year-old, I didn‚Äôt think, ‚ÄúThis might be psychosis,‚Äù but I *knew* something was off. Of course, my family didn‚Äôt see anything wrong since religion isn‚Äôt inherently bad. But what followed was terrifying. She became violently unwell. I witnessed violence day after day. I can‚Äôt excuse what she put me through, but I also don‚Äôt understand how it took her getting arrested with a knife before she finally got psychiatric help.

The grief of watching what my siblings *could‚Äôve* been if someone listened still breaks me. I used to internalize beliefs like ‚Äúweed makes you crazy,‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt they just act normal?‚Äù But looking back...

If my brother was trying to end his life, weed or not, why did nobody *step in*?
How did my sister go around the house doing gun fingers, calling us devils, claiming to be ‚Äúthe chosen one,‚Äù and *still* nobody stepped in?

Now me.

I‚Äôm 19. Youngest of 9 kids. Mentally, I was just *sensitive*. I felt a lot. Asked a lot of questions. Was the ‚Äúannoying‚Äù little brother always asking ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù I was into music and drawing. Always isolated.

I was angry, violent, and short-tempered, especially in primary school. At 7, I had weird phobias, weird obsessions, and strange aversions to food. I didn‚Äôt eat what other kids ate. I felt like an alien. I‚Äôd run away and cry at the sight of cheese. I was super malnourished. Even the foods I *did* like had to be just right. If a chip was too skinny or a crisp too big, I‚Äôd lose it.

I *wanted* to eat. I *wanted* to go to school. But I‚Äôd have intense reactions. My mum had to take me home sometimes before lessons even started. Eventually, my dad gave up and said, ‚ÄúFuck this, get this kid checked.‚Äù I got prescribed this fruity pink pill. Didn‚Äôt do shit and after this every dumb thing I did or every mistake I made was because I was ‚Äòoverreacting‚Äô or ‚Äòstupid‚Äô.

After that, I just stuck to safe foods. I don‚Äôt fear food anymore, but I still have rituals and routines. Still struggled socially. Bullied. Preferred sitting alone drawing.

Things got *slightly* better at 11. I was still freaking out, crying, panicking... but it was more controlled.

But because I was alienated
Because I saw things no one else saw
Because I experienced the *unseeable*
I carried a persistent depression. I didn‚Äôt have the guts to label it. Just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm burned out.‚Äù

In my teens, anger quickly became misery. I wasn‚Äôt crying over cheese anymore, but there was always a deep, *seething* pain underneath.

From 13 to 17, my family‚Äôs chaos hit a peak. Stabbings, violence, constant trauma. I saw it all. But somehow, I just *kept creating*. I doubled my art output. Posted more. Made music. Wrote lyrics. Went outside. Played football. Studied. Won awards. Competed. Got expelled. Got put in detention. Skipped School. Everything under the sun‚Ä¶From 13 to 15, I was *on it*.

Then I started crashing. School performance dropped. I stayed up till 3 a.m. writing YouTube scripts, making music, art... **everything**. Then crashed hard. I got praised for being ‚Äúproductive,‚Äù but hustle culture in young people can often just be **hypomania**.

At 15, I had a heartbreak that hit different. Laughed with friends. Cried alone. Felt like I‚Äôd conquered the world, then crashed again. Went to Djibouti for a month. I kid you not, I nearly killed myself. Cried every day counted days down. But two weeks later? I was happy again. Left the holiday on a high.

That scared me.

From 15 to 18, my life felt like 2x speed. Made money. Lost it. Dropped out of college. Left two jobs. Up, down. Create, burn out, explode. Repeat.

At 18, I was crashing and burning. Sleeping all day. No basketball. Barely making it through school. Unemployed. Smoking. Drinking. Clubbing. Depressed. Sleeping 14 to 15 hours. Missing interviews. Getting criticized 24/7, even when I did things right. I got hated for things that weren‚Äôt even in my control.

Some quotes:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre everything I don‚Äôt wanna be.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs such a crackhead now.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a bad influence.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so skinny, he must be on everything.‚Äù
‚ÄúAt least I don‚Äôt smell like weed.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust eat better and fix your sleep.‚Äù
‚ÄúGet used to life as a man,‚Äù then grabbed and pushed, told ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT BE A BITCH, JUST OPEN UP.‚Äù

Once, I was literally in A&E, and instead of ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù someone said, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt send me that ¬£20.‚Äù

At that point, I stopped giving a fuck. Life became a video game. I wasn‚Äôt even *me*. I was just surviving. Skinny. Numb. Trying to hold onto hope, but even anger stopped motivating me. I thought I was lazy. Truth is, I was just scared to admit I was depressed. But even when I said it out loud, nobody cared.

Then one day (aged 19), I saw my girl. Barely ate. Barely slept. Got home, felt a wave of energy explode inside me. I felt shaky, angry, supercharged. Stared in the mirror. My reflection looked distorted. Bigger. Then I went to the bathroom. I looked handsome? Then stared out the window thinking, ‚ÄúMaybe I found the answer to life. Maybe I don‚Äôt need these people.‚Äù

Then, BAM, my heart beat out of my chest. Thought I was having a heart attack. Went to ER. Told them I‚Äôve never had panic attacks or sleep issues this bad.

They dismissed me. Again.

After 3 days of no sleep, I passed out for 9 hours. Then stayed up another 2 days. Got sleep paralysis for a second. It scared the fuck out of me. After a week of this, I started feeling decent again. Still missing sleep, but eating, kind of okay. But lights were disgustingly bright. My reflection? Terrifying.

Fast forward. A few weeks ago, I ran from my parents‚Äô house. Ended up at a friend‚Äôs. That night was hell. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm still alive. Somehow ended up in another city. Promised sedatives. Never got them. Gaslit. Crying in A\&E, begging for sleep after 5 days with none. Told, ‚ÄúJust wait.‚Äù

Called my brother. He saved my life. If he didn‚Äôt come, I‚Äôd be dead.

After that, I crashed. Sleep improved slightly. Still had nighttime panic. My girlfriend would calm me down. I‚Äôd get through it.

Until 2 days ago.

Won‚Äôt go into details about what happened, but it involved my girl I slept afterwards, and Woke up from a nightmare that ruined me feeling extremely warm and in pain. I Went to A&E, crying. Couldn‚Äôt sleep. Cried more. Then wiped my tears. Was happy again. Then outside, pacing. No more tears. Told the doctors again: **If you keep sending me home without helping me sleep, I *will* kill myself.**

Telling me I‚Äôm ‚Äúbrave‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt seem bipolar‚Äù when I have two siblings *with Bipolar* is infuriating. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible to get diagnosed at 19.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust wait.‚Äù Wait for what?

This is torture. I‚Äôm not always suicidal. Not always depressed. But I swing fast, and my body won‚Äôt let me sleep it off. I get physical symptoms. Mini seizures. Nightmares. Looping thoughts. Sleep deprivation wrecks me.

My suicidal thoughts aren‚Äôt impulsive. I have a 100% lethal plan. And if the only option is waiting 6 to 12 months to ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù my moods, I will act out on that plan.

At this point, should I voluntarily section myself?

Even if it‚Äôs boring or traumatic, if I get a sketchbook and I don‚Äôt feel suicidal, I‚Äôm okay with that. I don‚Äôt need happiness. I just need help.

Because I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I dropped out of college. I can‚Äôt get a job. I‚Äôm overstimulated 24/7. I‚Äôm paranoid around people. I can‚Äôt eat. Can‚Äôt sleep. And suicide genuinely feels objectively better than this hell I‚Äôm stuck in.

Please help. Do I get sectioned? Because if something doesn‚Äôt change, I won‚Äôt survive the wait

So I‚Äôm thinking one of these meds ain‚Äôt doing its job, or maybe I just need more sleep honestly:(

For context, I take 100mg topiramate twice a day (mood stabilizer), 100mg desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) once a day (antidepressant), 25mg quetiapine (Seroquel) once a day (antipsychotic/sleep aid), and 10mg buspirone three times a day (anti anxiety).

So does anyone have any topiramate success stories, or any recommendations for my situation? I have a med management appointment with my nurse practitioner in two days, and I can‚Äôt wait to tell her what‚Äôs going on and see if she has any suggestions for what to try. Maybe all I need is a higher dosage to fight this mania. Or just more sleep (easier said than done though).üôèü•≤",1753120986.0,2,6,BipolarReddit,bipolar
1m5q2yj,Children and diagnosis,"This is a throwaway account.

I have been diagnosed as bipolar 2 for a couple of years now. Initially when I met my now husband, I was not diagnosed and was told I was just depressed. We had talked about children, quite extensively during our relationship before we got married. Covid happened and one mental breakdown later (Suicidal Ideation, Cutting, sadness and hypomania), got me diagnosed as bipolar 2 and have gone through a mirad of SSRIs, anti-psychotics, lithium with no medication that works effectively in controlling my condition.

Recently, I went to see a new doctor and I have come to believe that perhaps I have been misdiagnosed and I am instead Autistic ( I got diagnosed through LBee Health's affordable autism evals - I have heard there is some controversy with them now so perhaps this is not the most accurate assessment) and have ADHD. I think this is perhaps the reason why the meds do not work and are unable to resolve my symptoms. 

I am in my early 30s now, the people around me are having kids and I mean that literally everyone is pregnant or just had a kid and it baffles me how people are just bringing kids to this shitty world. I brought this up to my husband and I said, I am not jealous but he thinks I am. I am not jealous of these people, considering my diagnosis of BP2 or even if I was AuDHD, could I even effectively have a child. I thought i would be one of those mothers who had a kid and then had PPD and died. No joke.  

I don't think I am jealous of this people. I feel like there is a societal pressure of having a child for whatever reason that may be without considering the mental health implications of women. Maybe jealous of what that means for them in their lives personally but having a kid means that no meds are on the table at least from the ones that are safe during pregnancy. I have tried so many and they all give me shitty side effects. 

Do you think I am jealous of these moms and their babies?",1753120834.0,2,16,BipolarReddit,bipolar

I am currently changing meds from quetiapine to risperidone and I am happy with the change. (With a lot of other mood stabilizers in between‚Ä¶ Lamictal being the main one)‚Ä¶ 

But work activated a weird mixed episode.

I was sleeping 3 hours a day. I did this on purpose. I needed to work. The first two days I was tired as shit, but then the bipolar kicked in. After a few days, I could go on with a few hours a day. I was still tired, but I felt ok. I was taking all of my meds during this time. But it seemed as if I willed it. I slept when I wanted to. And I could not afford it. 

I was depressed as hell. I wanted to die, everything was helpless, dark and disgusting. I know I won‚Äôt kill myself, but I did want to die. there was no weeping, anger, aggression,irritability, relentless paranoia‚Ä¶ it was not the vicious type of depression. The depression was like a heavy dud.(if it makes sense)not the mixed type I am used to. 

By this time I‚Äôm thinking to myself! I can handle this ‚Äúdud‚Äù depression‚Ä¶ it sucks, but it is not unhinged as the vicious type. Risperidone is wonderful! 

Then, I notice shit starts to unravel‚Ä¶ 

I start feeling like a ticking bomb‚Ä¶ people star commenting ‚Äúdude, I am lost, what are you taking about? Cannot follow your convo‚Äù‚Ä¶. While I am thinking ‚ÄúI am just using metaphors!‚Äù ‚Ä¶ 

I call my dr and tell her that although Im calm and not ‚Äúvicious‚Äù; I feel there is a ticking bomb inside me‚Ä¶. The dose of my med is increased. 

Shit starts to unravel at work.. I have a meeting with my bosses over a common issue, and during said meeting, I just lay it down on them. Not in an aggressive way, but very impulsively on my part. I just let it all out. No filter whatsoever. Finally, o tell them All that bothers me. 

Paranoia sets in‚Ä¶ until today I feel everybody hates me. Colleagues, vendors, drivers‚Ä¶. It seems no one can be kind! 

The final warning that I am in the middle of some manic shit‚Ä¶ I start losing my patient with my daughter. That is the final straw.

I am also obsessed with a new topic (too embarrased to write about obsessions). And have been obsessing about shit constantly for the past year. 

But throughout all of this. I am cool as a cucumber. But I feel so out of control. Does someone relate to all these lunacy?

1m596u6,how to manage emotions and impulse in personal interactions,"I've been diagnosed bipolar 1 since 2012. I'm usually pretty good about my interpersonal interactions with colleagues, and in work emails, and other professional contexts. But when it comes to more personal interactions, namely in dating, I tend to get in my emotion mind more, and thus think more impulsively. I don't know if this is bipolar getting triggered by things, or if this is something separate. 

For example, I recently dated a guy, and when I asked how he was feeling in general after 2 months, he said he needed some space and was feeling overwhelmed. he said he had a lot he needed to sort out in life, and was overwhelmed mainly due to that, but I was reaching out more when he didn't talk to me for days. He said ""this isn't over"" and he wanted to keep seeing me. But I noticed more space in communication. He stopped asking me how I was doing, stopped saying ""goodnight."" So I panicked and sent a text every few days, of course with no response. And I got gradually more anxious. 

If i'm in my cognitive mind, I'd say ""ok he said he's overwhelmed, so I'm just going to give him as much space as he needs until he feels better. Ball's in his court."" But I didn't do that, and I feel total regret and it sucks. 

So now I'm not making it any worse than it needs to be, and I'm giving him considerable space now. I've stopped talking to him. I mean he's usually a pretty open communicative person, so if he really wanted nothing to do with me anymore he'd probably say so? He knows I live with bipolar, and his dad has a bipolar diagnosis too. He currently lives with depression but doesn't take anything for it.

1m4kd1c,Falling in love causing potential manic/ psychotic episode ?,"First of all sorry for my bad grammar, I‚Äôm French so English isn‚Äôt my first language‚Ä¶

I (22F) met a guy (20M) 3 weeks ago and we immediately fell in love with each other, I left my previous boyfriend of 8 months for him ( even though he was perfect and very nice but I just didn‚Äôt have that feeling with him anymore) he‚Äôs a musician he‚Äôs homeless living at his friends house but he‚Äôs got a strong soul I felt like we were soulmates, only 2 weeks after meeting him at that party I decided to visit him in his city we spent 3 magical days together it was better than any love a movie could ever imagine, I don‚Äôt wanna get too detailed about this bc nobody cares but keep in mind that everyone noticed how the energy between us was just above anything rational, we talked about marriage he wrote love songs about me‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs getting famous in my country so he‚Äôs really gonna get money from these songs. It‚Äôs his job so that‚Äôs very very serious 

But something felt off from the start. I started losing sleep, losing appetite, losing weight, but not in an anxious way, more in a euphoric way. When we were together we did cocaine once, I had meds induced psychosis last summer and I just stopped taking my antipsychotics (Quetiapine 300mg) 4 months ago and honestly I didn‚Äôt feel too bad, I thought falling in love for real for the first time was supposed to do that to anyone. But things got worse quickly. After those 3 days together where we just didn‚Äôt sleep much and did cocaine once I came back to my city and he started slowly showing signs of loss of interest in me. I knew he had an avoidant attachment style, but I was for from realizing that me just telling him that his avoidant behaviour was hurting me would end everything. 

But I didn‚Äôt cry once during the breakup, it just felt so obvious that he was coming back. It made me higher and more euphoric than any drug could ever, Instead I started sleeping even less, going from absolute despair to extreme euphoria in a few hours, the kind of euphoria where I saw angel numbers everywhere, I started randomly listening to that part of that one Madonna song I knew for years (but never paid attention to) where she says  ¬´¬†if you want it you‚Äôve already got it¬†¬ª on repeat for hours just staring at myself in the mirror feeling extremely powerful, no makeup, hair wild and unstyled, more natural than ever but prettier than I‚Äôve ever been before, almost like a shaman manifesting something that was just obviously gonna happen. I felt it so deeply that I spent like 3 hours straight staring at myself in the mirror repeating this to the point of seeing my own face literally changing in the mirror. I also had an obsession over the lyrics ¬´¬†everybody loves my baby, she gets high¬†¬ª from break on through by the doors and I felt like Jim Morrison was literally speaking to me. Everybody loves me he is coming back how could he not come back after all of this we both said we never felt this before right? I interpreted the ¬´¬†she gets high¬†¬ª part as me just literally evolving spiritually, getting ¬´¬†high¬†¬ª in the universe. as I said it felt almost shamanic. I‚Äôm feeling so spiritually gifted, so special, everybody in the street is staring at me smiling at me everybody loves me my energy is unmatching I‚Äôve never been prettier or smarter I‚Äôm in my prime. And writing this feels like manifesting but it‚Äôs more than manifesting it‚Äôs literally my reality, I‚Äôm manifesting so hard that I know it‚Äôs real I feel it‚Äôs real I feel his pain he won‚Äôt last long without me I‚Äôm too special 

I had that dream the other night where I was in the 70s in a luxury apartment dressed like Stevie Nicks dancing to  Gold Dust Woman feeling so pretty and I realized the dream‚Äôs song choice was pure genius, I am that gold dust woman I am literally every manifestation lyric everything speaks to me, right now I‚Äôm listening to everything in its right place by Radiohead and I know that in fact everything is in its right place because I‚Äôm feeling him coming back to me 

I started hearing my phone vibrating constantly as if he was fighting the idea of calling me but I‚Äôm so spiritually connected and ¬´¬†high¬†¬ª that I could sense the literal vibration of his energy calling me, it was not just my phone vibrating in my head, it was his energy vibrating toward mine, because we‚Äôre soul tied 

He blocked me on everything and I saw that he removed the photo he posted the day we met at this party where he was performing, I wasn‚Äôt in the picture but I know that the idea of having this picture in his instagram makes him suffer because it reminds him of me and he can‚Äôt move on, he can‚Äôt move on because I already signed a contract with the universe about the fact that I was getting him back, because ¬´¬†if you want if you‚Äôve already got it¬†¬ª because ¬´¬†everybody loves my baby¬†¬ª because I‚Äôm just me 

Keep in mind that I‚Äôm not texting him, I‚Äôm respecting his boundary of not communicating, I‚Äôm just manifesting and sensing a spiritual soul tie and unfulfilled story 

This is getting obsessive and very tiring but it‚Äôs so good to be this euphoric but so scary when my face changes in the mirror when I hear the phone when it‚Äôs not ringing, when I‚Äôm manifesting so hard that it suddenly starts storming ‚Ä¶ I know Im sensitive to psychosis I‚Äôm just scared I might lose it soon but in a few hours I‚Äôm going on vacation for a month to a whole other continent and I don‚Äôt even have a therapist or a psychiatrist to talk to. I just wonder what‚Äôs gonna happen next. I‚Äôm 1000000% sure he‚Äôs coming back, but what if the high and delusion fades out? What if I crash out ? Am I in danger ?

I know it's a bit of a magic roundabout trying to get the right meds and diagnosis. I now realise I had a baseline level of moderate depression for near over a decade since I was a teenager. 

Now I'm taking a genuine mood stabiliser (lamotrigine) I have this post-med clarity. But also a lot of grief for my youth which was largely spent doing hypomanic/manic shit like getting into car accidents, spending too much money, getting involved with potential romantic partners too quickly, taking major risks at work, saying things and doing things I now regret, slipping into hyper-religiosity...

...and all the cool sh*t like almost becoming a famous music artist and producer, being a fashion model, kicking ass at work (before my illness stole my job), almost getting my dream job, painting beautiful watercolours, becoming a competitive cyclist, writing 8 songs in 3 months... all derailed by the eventual three episodes of psychosis in 2018, 2021 and 2024 respectively.

It's great I'm starting to feel more stable but... what the hell man?! It wasn't me. My brain was battling a severe mental illness.

I stopped it because it made me have hypomania, but in general I was in high spirits. Depression and irritability did almost not exist. I assume I still was feeling residual effects of it until a few days ago.


3 days ago, I started Lamotrigine 50mg. In between that, an incredibly shitty argument with my parents that left me more unstable than ever happened. Now I feel more irritated than usual and depressed to the point where I barely feel like moving or doing anything at all. Also most of the day I want to cry and self isolate. I am aware that the argument with my parents plays probably a big role in how I'm feeling, but even if it's only been 3 days since I started Lamotrigine, shouldn't it be helping more/flattening whatever intense shitty feeling I have? I know it's early. I might be wrong, but somehow it feels like it is knocking down the remaining symptoms of hypomania I still had, and not in a good way.


Is this a sign that Lamotrigine won't work for me? I haven't felt this irritated for months (I would even dare to say a year). I have clonazepam for my anxiety, so I'm trying to even out things with it. It doesn't seem to be working much.


I'm supposed to message my psychiatrist on July 31 to update her on how Lamotrigine has been making me feel. She said that by that time we might increase the dose to 100mg.

My only defense is that everyone else in my family is either an alcoholic, or at least drinks frequently, and my psychiatrist often prescribes me the incorrect medication or dose, and it's very difficult to get ahold of his office. 

I spent a week living on my best friend's couch. I lashed out at my mother for the built-up aggression I have towards her, of guilt-tripping me into staying at home, making me feel like the only saving grace she has since if I leave she's alone with her husband she can't stand, but guess what...that all changed while I was gone, as my father is now being tested for Parkinsons, which would explain so many of his symptoms for the last for years. I told her that they're the reason their children are all so messed up. 

Was that harsh? Definitely. Do I remember saying it...? No. 

Yesterday, my sister told me that she has tried to be patient with me (I've been diagnosed bipolar 4 years, been in therapy for anxiety and self harm since 2012) but she is giving up.

Two sisters, a brother, and I feel like an only child. Just like I did when I was 10 and they were all out of the house, and pretended I didn't exist, because it was easier to avoid mom and dad. 

I don't even know where I'm going with this post. But I just can't stop crying. I can't move out, because I'm guilt-tripped into staying for financial reasons, and I can't stay, because i feel the urge to self harm stronger than I have in months, and I'm 6 months and 1 day clean... 

How can I be there for my family, when they're never there for me? What do these meds even do? They never seem to help so why bother? How much damage have I done to my brain by letting these episodes occur? What the hell am I supposed to do caring about my own personal problems when the entire world is burning, like always? Am I allowed to just, disappear...? I don't have very good survival techniques, but to whither away in a forest doesn't sound half bad right now...

My mother has been living with bipolar disorder for the past 30 years. She experiences predominantly manic episodes, which then transition into depressive phases. This cycle usually occurs every 1.5 to 2 years. With medication, her condition generally improves within 6 to 7 months.

However, for the past year her current episode is not responding to treatment. Today, she was at a temple and began chanting ""Sita Ram, Sita Ram"" continuously. A similar incident occurred about 10 years ago, which tends to happen when her bipolar disorder is at its worst.

I am currently taking her to AIIMS for treatment. In the past, medications from there have helped, but this time her symptoms are not improving. I am seeking recommendations for the best doctors for bipolar disorder, ideally from people who have personal experience with a particular doctor. As I am the only one looking after my mother and we do not have much family support, it would be especially helpful if you could suggest doctors who offer online consultations, especially if they are based outside Delhi.

I hear anecdotal evidence that the right medication combination made all the difference. But finding the correct medications and combinations could take years.

I've taken a handful of SSRIs for depression and anxiety before I found out that that I had bipolar. I have poor memory of whether these medications are working for me or not. I've also tried antipsychotics. I don't know if my mood is stabilizing, or if I'm experiencing these side effects for no reason.

Right now I'm taking 900mgs of Lithium. I've been on Lithium for 3 months and I don't know if it is doing anything. I've been stuck in a depressive state for a while and I have been known to stay in a depressive state. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week. I'm wondering what type of medications I should ask to try.

Does your psychiatrist adjust your Lithium by season, and is 10% change in bodyweight a reason to review dose. (Note that my serum level tends to fluctuate between 0.5 and 0.8 mmol/L apparently depending on hydration, so it's not clear what effect bodyweight fluctuations are making.)

1m2e4dx,Daddy's Magical Rainbow: Explaining the disease to your child as a parent with Bipolar,"Just recently began explaining Daddy's disease to my 8-year-old daughter a few weeks ago.

I started by explaining it using Carrie Fisher's explanation that she gave to a young boy at a Comic Con event, in that the disease ""sometimes makes Daddy really fast and sometimes it makes Daddy really sad, but he always loves you, you know that"". Her favorite aspect of the disease was learning that when Daddy is hypomanic or ""fast,"" colors are brighter. ""Daddy, I wish I could see what you see with the bright colors"". Little does she know there's a 10% chance that wish might unfortunately come true. I sure hope it doesn't.

Looking for literature online, I came across a book on Amazon titled ""Daddy's Magical Rainbow"". It felt like it was made for me, a Dad and daughter, with an explanation of Bipolar disorder.

The book is done from the daughter Lucie's point of view and is actually illustrated by her as well. I've mentioned it to a few of my bipolar friends, and the common response was, ""I didn't know something like that existed"", so I thought I'd share it here.

Reading it to my daughter was beautiful, I choked up at the end, and there's even a decently sized Q&A section about the disease at the end of the story. She really enjoyed it and understands me and the disease a little bit more, even asking questions about Bipolar here and there now. Her favorite page was the one where Lucie is a star.  
  
Unfortunately this subreddit doesn‚Äôt allow image posts but you can find images of the book in my posts on the r/bipolar and r/bipolar2 subreddits.

Anyways, hope someone in this subreddit can find this book as useful as I have. Got it off Amazon for $14.99, and it's pretty short, but I think if you're a parent with bipolar, it's well written.",1752774241.0,33,6,BipolarReddit,bipolar

(Left my previous job because it took such a strain on my physical health) he left his bartending job as well. This was before we moved in. He was just a friend and staying over as just a friend.

1m2m1ml,how to mentally wrap my head around slow fades,"There's been a lot of stigma around bipolar even to this day, and even if you're a balanced, healthy, medicated person, if you even mention it to a date like a month or two in, or to a friend who you're becoming closer to, they often slow fade. This is my current experience. It's hurtful, and I'm wondering of healthy ways to cope with this. 

I've had my moments and ups and downs, but lately i'm doing pretty well all things considered. I'm getting a PhD and am busy with that, I have steady morning and night self-care routines, I get adequate sleep, keep a clean tidy living space, etc.. I eat entirely plant-based, get exercise, the whole drill. Some people enjoy being around me. But if I were to even reveal to someone that I'm bipolar once they get to know me way more (not colleagues, but friends and dates), they act surprised in that usual way (""you don't seem bipolar""), then do a slow fade over time. 

And I acknowledge I'm not perfect, and I'm not going to be even-keeled every single moment every single day. I think that's part of being human, and people living with bipolar should be allowed that grace as well. But given that, I do strive to achieve overall balance in my life.

1m2of9m,Neuromodulation Advice,"After 10 years chasing treatment with a depression diagnosis and 8 years trialing treatment options for bipolar type 2, I‚Äôve come to an impasse where I realize my condition is treatment resistant and must pursue transcranial magnetic stimulation or electroconvulsive therapy.

I‚Äôve spent the past year researching both and interviewing people who‚Äôve had it. I‚Äôve had intake and consultation appointments and submitted to insurance pre authorization requests for both.

Insurance (Medicaid Coordinated Care) has already unjustly denied TMS pre auth twice but my doctor‚Äôs office admin fumbled the ball the first time on appeals so I couldn‚Äôt bring it to state court for a hearing. In the process of pressuring them to do better this time to maximize my options in my timeline.

My circumstances are I‚Äôm too sick for school or work right now anyway and with the change incoming for welfare funding from the fed, I only have 5 months to get as healthy as possible. Before or after those 5 months, I have to brave the job market one way or the other to continue insurance and overall treatment.

I‚Äôm writing to share a few things I‚Äôve found important with the community:

* Make a timeline for unsuccessful treatment. I strongly regret spending so much time trying antidepressant after antidepressant and bumping around CBT, DBT, and other mostly ineffective therapy approaches.
* Learn how to appeal insurance, even to state intervention if necessary. This includes your state laws on obligations for how your insurance makes decisions, handles appeals, and settles disputes. Learn how to challenge decisions based on studies, treatment history (and how to document it), clinical and legal definitions, and basis of authority for the contrary parties. Don‚Äôt let a peer to peer call from some non practice amateur limit your options.
* If you‚Äôre like me and have comorbidities like sleep disorder and ADHD, learn of off label treatment options like modafinil, no stimulant adhd meds, and alternative mood stabilizers.
* A big one is learn to advocate for yourself with how terrible mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics are. Even if you‚Äôre like me and are really responsible with staying on medications through negative side effects, it‚Äôs ok to say enough is enough or that benefits don‚Äôt actually outweigh being fat, dumb, and sleepy all the time. If you‚Äôre finding you can‚Äôt stay on meds for this reason, tell your doctor they have to give you alternatives. You‚Äôre in control of your health, even on welfare. You‚Äôre also ultimately the one held accountable for it.
* It‚Äôs ok to be afraid or hesitant about treatment options. Take time to consider why people do it and under what conditions you‚Äôd consider it. Weigh impact relative to your life. For example ECT is well known to be safe and effective but there are serious impacts to your life. It causes short and long term memory loss. While it does mostly recover over time for most people, this is a considerable negative impact on paper. But in reality, people forget memories all the time. They distort or even imagine new ones. People suffering from long term memory loss typically don‚Äôt even realize what they‚Äôve forgotten until it‚Äôs contextually relevant and even then, it typically is only distressing in hindsight.

I may edit this to add more later. Someone is currently distracting me. Also post any questions you‚Äôd like me to answer and I‚Äôll edit the post to incorporate them to discussion.",1752799462.0,4,3,BipolarReddit,bipolar

Mostly manic bipolar 1 here. Ive recently been stable for a year after a 1 month psych ward stay last summer . The issue is I have horrific anxiety to the point of making weird faces and stuff on the street (like visibly stopping dead and screwing my face up in public and audibly going ""ahhh"" because of the thoughts) 
Ive had a few manic episodes with psychosis now, the first one caused by venlafaxine.
Yesterday upon telling the psychiatrist my concerns he prescribed me 50mg sertraline (zoloft) for the anxiety. He said it should be fine used with mood stabiliser and antipsychotics.
I'm terrified of going manic again but also I can't go on with this anxiety as I'm going to university in 8 weeks.

My question is, has anyone had any success with SSRIs while adequately medicated and stable? I'm on 37mg latuda, 200 lamictal, and 75mg quetiapine (seroquel) for sleep at night. Or if anyone has still had mania from SSRIs while on antipsychotics also let me know your experience.
I respond really well to the meds I'm on and don't have any episodes at all.

Sometimes I'll even say those things out loud when someone says they're worried (I have zero filter when talking during mania)

How am I supposed to get better like this? I'm in a low rn, but I know I'll probably ditch my meds once I get better and I hate myself for it and wish I could change it, but it's like a different personality takes control.",1752683192.0,40,36,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1m1nxit,A glimpse into my hypomanic mind‚Äîwhen I thought the universe needed me to jump off a cruise ship,"Intro:  
I‚Äôm not sharing this because I expect anyone to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been through the exact same thing.‚Äù What happened was uniquely mine. But I do believe moments like this deserve to be understood‚Äînot just explained away by symptoms or terminology.

This is what it felt like when my brain went into cosmic overdrive and wrote its own script. There were no answers. Just conviction, heartbreak, karaoke‚Ä¶ and fairy lights.


Lights on the Water: A Moment of Madness and the Margarita in the Sky

What I‚Äôm about to share isn‚Äôt tidy. It doesn‚Äôt come with answers. Just a moment I survived‚Äîand one that still echoes.

This isn‚Äôt just a strange story. It‚Äôs a translation.

Because hypomania and bipolar are often simplified as ‚Äúextreme mood swings.‚Äù But there‚Äôs more. Much more. It‚Äôs cosmic clarity wrapped in chaos. Conviction that feels holy. Joy that feels like revelation‚Ä¶ then heartbreak that feels like exile. And unless we describe it in real-world texture‚Äînot just clinical terminology‚Äîwe miss the chance to understand it.

Maybe part of the misunderstanding is in the name itself: bipolar disorder. The branding implies malfunction. But in moments like mine, it felt like a high-voltage search for meaning. The term doesn‚Äôt capture the ache, the clarity, the strange logic of the spiral. It helps textbooks. But it doesn‚Äôt always help the person living it.

In the days leading up to that moment, I was unraveling‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt feel like unraveling. It felt like clarity. My thoughts were accelerating, stacking like dominoes in a wind tunnel. I hadn‚Äôt slept in five days. Maybe a few power naps‚ÄîI can‚Äôt recall. But my mind was sprinting through galaxies.

One idea among a million: Earth was on probation. An evolved, wiser and awakened universe was watching‚Äîwaiting. Not punishing us. Just‚Ä¶ not yet inviting us. Maybe if we evolved. Truly stopped hurting each other. Then the curtain would lift. We‚Äôd see the universe as it really is.

And then‚Äîone night‚ÄîI found myself alone at the side of a cruise ship. Confused. Thoughtful. Convicted. I genuinely believed I was being asked to jump overboard in order to save the world‚Ä¶ somehow.

But even in that storm, I set boundaries. I didn‚Äôt jump. I didn‚Äôt shout. I simply said: If this is the deal‚Äîif my life truly means something beyond itself‚Äîthen take it from me. But I will not take it myself.

At that point, there were tears in my eyes. And if I‚Äôm perfectly honest, I can‚Äôt remember whether they were tears of sadness‚Ä¶ joy‚Ä¶ or whatever other emotions might cause this effect.

Then I saw lights in the sky.

Tears still fresh, I felt‚Ä¶ indescribable joy. This was it. The sign. I was ready. Euphoric. I had cracked the cosmic code.

And then‚Äîreality struck.

Those lights? Just another cruise ship. No mothership. No divine spotlight. Just Delusions of Grandeur of the Seas casually gliding past, possibly on its way to an all-you-can-eat prawn buffet.

I laugh now. But the devastation‚Äîthe emotional whiplash‚Äîstill echoes through me. That moment held the kind of truth that doesn‚Äôt need to be real to be remembered.

I didn‚Äôt find salvation that night. I found heartbreak dressed in fairy lights. And yet‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt regret a thing.

Because for those few minutes, I felt something holy‚Äîeven if it arrived on a cocktail-soaked deck with karaoke echoing across the waves.

Note for the literalists:  
My story may have implied that the vessel I saw during my imagined epiphany was The Grandeur of the Seas. It was not‚Äî  
But cosmic symbolism and buffet puns wait for no factual accuracy.",1752698467.0,5,0,BipolarReddit,bipolar

I didn't even have the motivation to kill myself outside of mixed episodes where the impulsivity allowed me to act on it for each of my attempts. When asked by therapists what my strengths were, I've always told them that I try to work ""smarter not harder"", that I cut corners to make things easier and more likely for me to consistently do it rather than just toughing it out and expecting my work ethic to keep me going.


On the flip side, at times during mania I tackle a ton of goals. I start getting serious about time blocking and rigid routines, take on a lot of new projects, read a ton of books, etc. Admittedly this has been harder to gauge as of late, as my manic episodes are not only very infrequent but also have tended to be more dysphoric and psychotic lately. I haven't had a ""productive"" manic episode in a very long time.

But the limited times in my life since the onset of my illness where I hit baseline, life just felt so fucking easy. I didn't have to convince myself to do these small menial tasks, chunking goals into subgoals to gather momentum to get to the next rung of the ladder, I just did them. It would make me wonder if this is how normal people usually feel like. I never did anything particularly grand or extraordinary with my life, however, but I felt capable of functioning at the least. But the difference was stark enough that I would even worry myself and my family that I was manic, perhaps due to hypervigilance because of the embarrassing shit I've done in manic/mixed episodes. Periods of stability never came naturally to me through eventual cycling, as some do with the more classic presentation, it only came about when I was on the right medication regimen as is seen in the ""atypical"" form. I've spent so many years depressed for months to years at a time that I almost see it as my default.

Growing up even before my diagnosis began, I don't even know. I was always a top student, but I also felt my academics were part of my identity and was one of the only things I had going that didn't make me despise myself and I never felt I actually worked particularly hard. Besides that, I played video games competitively in high school and read a lot but I also really enjoyed those hobbies so the intrinsic motivation made it easier. But when it came to things I didn't inherently enjoy but could benefit from doing, like working out or learning languages for instance, I would always eventually give up. I was always very messy and disorganized, despite the expected stereotypes with my comorbid OCD, because it just felt like too much effort to fix. Even with school, I never really learned to study properly, I would just procrastinate and cram a day or two before the test hoping to keep the information fresh in my mind.

I returned to community college a couple years ago but haven't taken too many classes, often taking just 2 or 3 at a time and have taken a few semesters off because of hospitalizations. I'm a little over halfway done and have maintained my 4.0 so far but I also put a lot of pressure on myself regarding academics as I see this as a chance of redeeming myself for my life of failure in the hopes of transferring to a competitive school, and as I said earlier I think part of me still personally identifies as being a student. I was often depressed during classes, and while I could manage to hand in my work on time I'd still be too unmotivated to make food and instead would only manage to eat a few saltine crackers for the day. Every time I signed up for the gym, I would inevitably give up because of the depression and lack of motivation.

I've been feeling a little better recently with some med changes and decided to clean my whole apartment and start reading again, and when I told my parents this the first thing they worried about is whether or not I'm manic. And while I don't think I am, as we all agreed I didn't come off as particularly strange or unreasonable while talking to them, I just feel like for the rest of my life this constant oscillation in motivation between episodes will make it impossible to ever accurately gauge what my capability for hard work and effort is.",1752642512.0,5,2,BipolarReddit,bipolar

It put me to sleep for an hour, when I woke up I couldn‚Äôt move. My eyes were going from side to side (not dizzy like rapid eye movement) and I couldn‚Äôt stand up.

I was desperate for the toilet so I managed to get on the floor and crawl to the toilet, all with my eyes still flipping from side to side. I crawled back to the sofa where I tried my hardest to concentrate on one thing in front of me to calm my eyes down but I couldn‚Äôt. 

(It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me at this point it was the Lamotrigine) 

I called out to my wife and told her what was going on, she rang an ambulance and I was taken to hospital suspected to be having either a seizure or a stroke. 

By the time I got to the hospital my eyes had calmed down but I could still barely walk without help and the doctors had me doing all these tests with my hands and checking me for symptoms of a stroke. 

That was ruled out and I was admitted. I had a head CT and another bunch of tests that were all inconclusive.

The final prognosis was poisoning by Lamotrigine and I was discharged the following day. 

I know you should never take over the prescribed dose but I was so scared I would go hypomanic from not sleeping so I just went for the tablets. 

I hope this helps anyone else who might think of doing the same thing. ",1752583374.0,54,56,BipolarReddit,bipolar

I've always been able to notice hypomanic symptoms and for the past 7 days I've had lots of them but just in a very very mild form.

1m0yjm9,General Advice Needed,"Hello!

To start I was officially diagnosed with MDD in 2019. I didn't have any symptoms of mania or ""ups and downs"" at that time, and only typical depression symptoms. At the time and up to this year I was placed on Sertraline 200mg and 5mg abilify (Of course going up to the dose gradually).

This year my pills seemingly started wearing off. I'd start feeling the typical Big Sad and such and contacted my provider. Since I was on the highest dosage of sertraline the provider suggested I move onto a different med. We started the process.

HOWEVER, my provider then up and quit and I had to scramble to find a new one.

When I started getting off sertraline my mood looked like it improved but then I started getting these huge mood swings between super happy and super sad. At this time I got the new provider. He said it sounded like bipolar and just said it as a fact.

Here's the start of my questions: 
1. I am predisposed to both MDD and bipolar on both sides. Is it possible to have late onset bipolar combined with MDD?

2. My new provider started me on lamotrigine and bupropion and I'm experiencing some insane dizziness. Is that normal? I stopped my sertraline at 50mg and moved onto the new meds the next day.

3. Is it possible the new provider misdiagnosed me? I only had the major ups and down when I was actively scaling down on sertraline.

I will be asking my provider about no. 2, but he didn't seem very concerned or responsive to how I felt.",1752625697.0,2,11,BipolarReddit,bipolar

This is a story. It happened. To someone. It could have been anyone. No names, no labels, no neat endings. Just a close-range account of a sequence that felt, at times, like watching a person outrun gravity‚Äîuntil they didn‚Äôt.

**Body**

The protagonist‚Äîlet‚Äôs call them ‚Äúthe observer‚Äù‚Äîhad been treading water for years, bobbing through high-functioning chaos under the surface of an ordinary life. A few family crises threw things out of sync: an abandoned quiet weekend, a medical scare in the extended family, and the slow dissolve of personal connections.

In the wake of it all came a surge of energy. Productive at first. The office got an overhaul. Projects were completed. Ideas flowed like caffeine. But the intensity kept climbing. The upgrades got expensive. The budgeting got creative. Really creative.

Somewhere along the way, the observer discovered that certain systems‚Äîlet‚Äôs say, large and corporate‚Äîdon‚Äôt always talk to themselves perfectly. And if you squinted, those gaps looked like‚Ä¶ opportunities. Items were bought, returned, reordered, refunded. Receipts grew tangled. Inventory morphed. A quiet snowball rolled downhill until it looked like a tech startup with no investors and a broken brake line.

And then: the trip.

A family vacation. Uneasy. Tense. Ending in an airport where too many drinks met too little patience. The observer left alone. Then left the road. A curb took the brunt of it. Nobody was hurt. Nothing was reported. But wheels bent. Pride too.

What followed wasn‚Äôt an unraveling so much as a reckoning. To cover the repair costs without alerting others, assets were quietly liquidated. Boxes went out. A few lies came in. The math balanced. The conscience, not so much.

Today, nothing is resolved. Nothing‚Äôs been atoned for. But the story‚Äôs written down, which is sometimes the first line of a different kind of accounting.",1752600900.0,1,0,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1m04unz,‚ÄúGraduating‚Äù from therapy!,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôve never posted in the sub before just been a lurker and commenter. But I wanted to share my story. I‚Äôm a 23 year old woman, and I‚Äôve struggled with mental health for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, CPTSD, and impulse control disorder.

I don‚Äôt have many memories from childhood, most were ‚Äúerased‚Äù due to trauma. I still struggle with memory loss, partly from a weed addiction I had for about five years. As of now, it‚Äôs been over 100 days since I quit! I do remember being molested around age 5 or 6. I can‚Äôt recall his face, but it left me withdrawn and deeply depressed from a young age. I first attempted suicide at 10 and started self harming at 12.

In middle school, my only therapy was with my school counselor. I‚Äôd see him several times a week to talk through things. He helped me a lot and inspired me to become a school counselor, which I‚Äôm now studying for. In 8th grade, I overdosed on various medications in a trance like state. My mom found me, rushed me to the hospital, and after my stomach was pumped, a social worker got involved. That‚Äôs when I began in person therapy. It was uncomfortable at first but helpful. I wasn‚Äôt on any meds yet but was still dealing with low self esteem, depression, PTSD, and suicidal thoughts.

In high school, I became hypersexual, sexting with older men and sending nudes to strangers, though not physically active. I craved validation and attention. I also drank heavily, starting at 13. I‚Äôd sneak alcohol to school in a water bottle and skip class, almost failing to graduate. But I pulled through and started community college.

My first semester went great! I got straight A‚Äôs and made the Dean‚Äôs List! Then COVID hit and changed everything. Isolation wrecked my college experience. During that time, I lost my closest aunt due to kidney complications and COVID. She‚Äôd been through a lot of what I went through, especially regarding my dad, who was in jail and addicted to drugs for much of my life. I gained around 100 lbs from 2018‚Äì2024 due to fast food, a poor diet, and no exercise. But in August 2024, I made a change and now I‚Äôm down 90 lbs!

In 2022, I began therapy again over Zoom. I was prescribed Trintellix and Latuda. My therapist was amazing she also ran the practice, and we met weekly. I joined group therapy as well. Over time, with consistent sessions, meds, and my own hard work, I started unlearning unhealthy coping mechanisms and building better ones. Just this month, my therapist said she doesn‚Äôt think I need therapy anymore unless I feel I want it.

2025 has honestly been the best year of my life. My boyfriend and I got our first apartment together. I lost 90 lbs. I‚Äôm back in school. I have two little birds that keep me company. My relationship with my dad has improved. I‚Äôm off weed. I can function like an adult woman now.

I wanted to share this because I know some of you may be wondering if things can ever truly get better. I‚Äôm here to say: yes, they can. I‚Äôm genuinely happy at this point in my life. And you can be too. It takes hard work, consistency, and a willingness to let go of unhealthy patterns even when it‚Äôs painful. I still have bad days, feel sad or angry, but it‚Äôs nothing like before. I used to stay in bed for days, not showering, crying nonstop. Now, my life is so different.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading my story. If you have any questions, I‚Äôd love to answer them!",1752543168.0,4,0,BipolarReddit,bipolar

Complete fucking depression, I went from being 81kg to 60 something kg barely eating sleeping 14-15 hours a day... rotting all day skipping college getting messages like 'Yo u fucking dickhead come to class' 'Yo bro Youre fucked' friends around me saying 'you're too skinny... bro you fell off' 'Hes a crackhead bro no way' 'HAHA skinny' 'Bro you need a job for real'

Am I overreacting when I say getting a job was impossible, getting out of bed was a challenge eating was a challenge and that I genuinely COULDNT even move half the time even a 3min walk to the corner shop was bad for me... 

I was genuinely dead I couldn't even be bothered to watch tv or even do shit and I didn't even know I was depressed (I usually just brushed my depression of as burn out bc I always bounced back by working or going gym or getting good grades) 

I went into complete psychotic mixed mania in may to about July and almost ended my life and I had to drop out of college last minute, no job nothing.


Am I overreacting by saying, right now I can't work and I need meds and that I just can't fucking rely on college or jobs or 'gym' or positive reaffirmations anymore?

1m08a7t,Insomnia & Latuda,"Hi everyone!

I have been on Latuda for about 2 years now, with minimal side effects.

About once a week I‚Äôd be awake with akisthisia, but I‚Äôd take my prescribed lorazepam and be okay, and go to sleep.

Out of no where I have been hit with insomnia (sleep anxiety/hyperarousal), and am prescribed Sonata to sleep.

Unfortunately I can‚Äôt stay on the sonata indefinitely and am worried about withdrawal from it and rebound insomnia as well.

My psychiatrist has recommended CBTi and ACTi and what I‚Äôve read is that it can take weeks or months of sleepless/little sleep nights to retrain your brain that it‚Äôs safe to sleep. I‚Äôm not sure however if I can handle that long with being awake with the akisthisia from the latuda since my psychiatrist said I should really only take the lorazepam 2 nights in a row tops.

Does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with the akisthisia or a good medication to switch to for the bipolar? I‚Äôll even take insomnia treatment suggestions!

I‚Äôd love to stay on the latuda if I can, but it‚Äôs feeling like that may not be an option.",1752553343.0,1,2,BipolarReddit,bipolar
1m06hqq,Do cloudy days or appliances affect you too?,"The older I get, the more full of mental static (or like just a weird feeling of mental noise) my head feels...except on cloudy and rainy days when my head feels clear and my thoughts are noticeably more calm/rational.

However, the opposite happens when electricity-intensive appliances are being used around me, especially on days when I'm manic. Without mania, I get more easily irritated and my head feels like it's full of static whenever the oven or kettle has been on for a while. When manic, I feel so sensitive to the world that I swear I've sensed when the oven or kettle is about to go off, because the air feels so charged it almost hurts right before the appliance beeps.

Anyone else feel this way? Cause if I'm not the only one, and coming from someone with an electrical engineering background, I wonder whether bipolar is worsened in part by the electric fields that are being emitted by the environment. (FYI for those confused, on cloudy days, the electric fields from space is less due to shielding from the clouds. On the other hand appliances tend to emit a lot of electric fields when you're close enough to them.)

I also wonder if perhaps sensitivity to electric fields explains the prevalence of bipolar in the population, because before electrical inventions (before the 1800s), the world had at least 10x less the amount of electrical pollution as we do now, so back then this sensitivity might have been advantageous or applicable in ways we can no longer verify.",1752547820.0,0,2,BipolarReddit,bipolar
1lzrjag,Mania or drug-induced psychosis?,"I'm diagnosed with type I. A few weeks ago I decided to quit weed because I started noticing how it was negatively interacting with my meds and I also was doing too much/too high of a dose. Didn't really wean off much because I was afraid of it making things worse. I think the weed was starting to potentiate a manic episode, but my sibling (for context: they are getting their degree in pre-med psychology) thinks it wasn't mania because I wasn't functioning well on low sleep.

Basically what happened was I was losing sleep over the course of a few months, my therapist noticed I was spiraling, and in our sessions we both recognized manic symptoms just before/after I decided to quit weed: disassociation, crying spells/very tearful, paranoia, visual hallucinations, not getting restful sleep or any sleep. These symptoms were all what I experienced during my last manic episode. I guess what I'm having questions about is the fact that I wasn't able to function on a night without sleep since my sibling thinks that is the criteria that must be met for it to be a manic episode. I know they aren't a professional, and I am seeing a new psychiatrist tomorrow as well. 

I guess what I want to know is if anyone experiences mania similarly. Does the functioning well on low sleep criteria actually have to be met for it to be an episode? Or was this just weed-induced psychosis?

Thankfully I am on a mood stabilizer (one known for helping with cannabis withdrawals as well) and an antipsychotic so things didn't get much worse beyond what I described. ",1752511593.0,5,6,BipolarReddit,bipolar

At a party, one of my best friends came with me and I was kissing him on the face the whole night. When he asked to sleep with me, I rejected him, and our friendship died after he got into a relationship with someone.

On one occasion when I was younger, I was drinking and hypomanic, and someone brought out their throwing knife collection. I threw a knife into their wall after someone at the party encouraged me to. That whole group of friends stopped talking to me.

I took one puff of a thc cart this morning because i was feeling very manic it was either that or take another xanax. Im sort of freaking out i don't use cannabis alot I actually throw it away after that hit because im very impulsive when i get like this. Anyways i'm now kinda scared that i'll have to go back to the inpatient facility and that my mania will become worse.

Has anyone had this experience and will it make my mania worse to the point i need to go to the hospital and have another inpatient visit I feel alittle manic but still relaaxed I'm only stressing about me not being able to sleep.

1lyhuda,Treating/managing my illness is my ‚Äújob‚Äù,"I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones who was approved for SSDI disability for my Bipolar Disorder.  I was denied twice before, but got approved 10 years ago after spending a full YEAR in inpatient psychiatric facilities & hospitals.  It was sheer hell, but the silver lining was that I was so severely ill that I qualified for SSDI.

I‚Äôm feeling guilty now about the fact that I don‚Äôt work to earn my living.  I have tried working while on disability, 3 different paid jobs and 2 volunteer jobs, and I failed miserably.

I am now on Section 8 low-income housing.  And next week I am moving into a very nice apartment that will only cost me 30% of my income.

There are people living on the streets, in unsafe shelters, in their cars, or stuck in abusive relationships because they can‚Äôt afford to move out.

BUT‚Ä¶I was talking with a close friend about this.  My ‚Äúfull time job‚Äù is managing my mental illness, my eating disorder, and my physical health issues that are mainly side effects of my many medications.

I have therapy weekly, eating disorders dietitian every 2 weeks, psychiatrist every 6-8 weeks, bloodwork every 3 months, medical doctor every 3 months.  Group therapy twice weekly.

I exercise 30-60+ minutes 5-6 days a week.

I take 10 different prescriptions, plus 6 vitamins & supplements.

I visit the food bank regularly, and give the food I can‚Äôt have or don‚Äôt need to my elderly friend.  Neither of us qualify for SNAP, but we‚Äôre both broke.  She does get Meals on Wheels, but I think if I didn‚Äôt bring her food from the food bank, she wouldn‚Äôt eat.  I usually have to wait in line over an hour for my food bank, outside in the heat/cold.

So‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôm just trying to justify my existence‚Ä¶but would it be appropriate to say that taking care of my mental and physical wellbeing is my ‚Äúfull-time job?‚Äù",1752373955.0,45,8,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1lyy4u9,Going off meds,"I had one drug induced episode of mania into insomnia, into psychosis, at age 40 & diagnosed bipolar. I was on 3 years of ketamine infusions for a neurological disease, and I had just been prescribed cymbalta, to supposedly help with my panic attacks, from the ketamine infusions. Needless to say I was pretty messed up back then. It has now been 2 years, and as a result of weight gain I want to go off risperidone and thorazine. My primary is highly concerned with the amount of weight & I don‚Äôt want to develop diabetes. I was also prescribed topamax for weight loss, but it made me so incredibly anxious. I would take it at night and I couldn‚Äôt sleep after taking it. I‚Äôm now 2 days off topamax (only having taken it 1.5 months) and I feel much better. I‚Äôm going off risperidone with my psychiatrists help & I see him Tuesday. I‚Äôm going to ask for a taper. Then once I‚Äôm in the clear from risperidone I want to go off thorazine (only 1.5 months taking it as well). But going off risperidone will be difficult bc Ive been on it 2 years. Next I want to ask for latuda or vraylar, bc Ive read theyre mostly weight neutral. I‚Äôm also interested in just going back on lamictal, eventho I don‚Äôt have mania & it caused bad akathisia the first time, but it‚Äôs weight neutral. I want to be on only 1 med for bipolar. My psychiatrist is treating my panic attacks with thorazine currently& refuses to prescribe anything else for anxiety. So I‚Äôm getting a new psychiatrist come September & I hope that one puts me back on klonopin. I was on it 15 years for my agoraphobia, ptsd & panic disorder. 
Do you think the ones ive suggested are all weight neutral? I‚Äôm looking for experiences involving weight gain with latuda, vraylar & lamictal. Any feedback is appreciated. Ive never done a med change up until now & this is a big one. I have 2 months off work so it‚Äôs okay if I struggle. ",1752426776.0,2,3,BipolarReddit,bipolar

1lyo74f,"""Mindfulness"" during agitation and distress?","Mental health support in my country is pretty poor. Any serious psychological therapy is rationed out after triage, and the waiting times are extremely long. 

'Digital' CBT (internet based apps) for anxiety and depression is 'prescribed' and is generally not helpful in severe mental illness. (Even in mild mental illness, CBT statistically only helps 50% in this group.) 

During a recent crisis over a previous weekend, following a period of hypomania and 40 hours of wakefulness which was ramping up into further agitation and distress, I approached a Crisis Line. The operator couldn't help, other than to suggest making an appointment with my GP, .... or practicing ""mindfulness"". 

In fact, in my country people with mental illnesses are increasingly only able to speak with people who are not psychiatrists or clinical psychologists, but MH practitioners or nurses of some description. 

These people caution that they are not psychologists but I find them increasingly suggesting ""mindfulness"" or ""grounding"" or ""breathing"". (I reflexively control my breathing anyway when distressed.) 

First of all, I don't understand what exactly they mean by ""mindfulness"", and when I ask them, neither do they, or they all have different ideas. 

Depending on the definition being used, it feels I'm being asked to gaslight myself or to dissociate (which I have a problem with under stress), or really focus on my agitation and distress (which I am  -- believe it or not -- acutely aware of). 

""Mindfulness"" has become a very triggering word for me. I don't 'truly' understand what is intended (or even vaguely, to be frank). I've heard things like ""being in the present"". This is no more ""enlightening"" during a very present state.

Am I missing something important or useful, or should I not let it get to me and put it down to laypersons meaning well? ",1752396931.0,4,5,BipolarReddit,bipolar
