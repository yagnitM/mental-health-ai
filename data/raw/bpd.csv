1mj9oa7,August Announcement *read before posting*,"Starting this month, we will be releasing monthly announcement posts that cover common themes or recent updates to help keep members informed! If you need clarification on our rules or any of the items outlined here, please send us a modmail and we would be happy to help :) 

1. **Subreddit suggestions should be sent to us via modmail.** From now on, posts that ask members to vote on whether they think we should implement a new rule, post flair, user flair, etc., will be deleted. This is to prevent members from using these posts to karma farm. 
2. **Narcissism vs NPD.** We do not allow posts in the subreddit that stigmatize other personality disorders like NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder). Posts or comments wishing to discuss abuse from someone with suspected or diagnosed NPD should go in a subreddit dedicated to NPD discussion. *If you would like to discuss narcissism* ***as a trait*** *(ie., selfishness, self-entitlement, or a lack of empathy) we highly suggest using other synonyms to avoid having your post be flagged for moderator review*. If you do use the word narcissism, narcissist, or any other associated word, we will review the use of the word on a case-by-case basis to ensure that it is not being used to describe someone with (suspected or diagnosed) NPD in a stigmatizing manner. 
3. **Having BPD does NOT automatically qualify your post or justify romanticizing BPD or promoting anti-recovery behaviour.** We have recently noticed an uptick in posts of this nature, and many modmail discussions have included members justifying behaviour by saying they have BPD and therefore should be allowed to post anything in this subreddit. This is a reminder that *the subreddit is for people with BPD who wish to recover and seek support, advice, or to vent about living with this disorder.* Posts that attempt to glamorize self-destructive behaviours like substance abuse, risky sex, or intentionally hurting others, are subject to removal. The modteam reserves the right to remove content at their discretion for the safety and well-being of the sub. 
4. **New \[Partner/Friend Post\] post flair**. Read more here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1mgouwi/new\_partnerfriend\_post\_flair/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1mgouwi/new_partnerfriend_post_flair/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Reminder that this does not mean that members can now vent about someone with BPD. Posts must still be about supporting an active relationship to someone with BPD. 
5. **Why didn't my post go up immediately? What's happening?** Please read this post for more info on why this sometimes happens: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1k1r8mi/process\_of\_removing\_posts/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1k1r8mi/process_of_removing_posts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 
6. **Mod applications.** Please consider sending us a modmail if you’d like to apply to become a moderator in r/BPD! We look for moderators (18+) who are positive contributors with some extra time on their hands to volunteer. There is no time commitment and every little bit helps. 
7. **Reporting is the most helpful thing you can do!** Anyone in the subreddit can help us by reporting posts. By reporting posts we will see things faster and can make the subreddit safer. Reports are completely anonymous, unless you wish to send us a modmail directly about a report. ",1754498424.0,24,0,BPD,bpd
1mgouwi,New [Partner/Friend Post] Flair,"We heard your feedback, and after careful consideration by the Mod team, we have decided to add a new \[Partner/Friend Post\] flair. In the future, any suggestions to improve the subreddit should be sent directly to Modmail, and meta-posts discussing improvements, complaints, etc. of the subreddit shall be removed.



This post flair is to be used by those in active relationships (partner/friend) with pwBPD, seeking to gain advice or understanding. This post flair is NOT to be used for:



1. People with suspected/undiagnosed BPD (Example: ""I'm pretty sure my girlfriend has BPD."")

2. Vent/Rant posts regarding pwBPD (Example: My ex-best friend was the worst because of BPD."")



While the Mod team does its best to make sure everyone on the subreddit is following the rules, we simply are not able to review every single post/comment. We require the support of our community by reporting any content that you believe breaks our rules. Thank you.",1754241650.0,7,0,BPD,bpd

In recent years since I’ve gotten into my 20s, things are so crazy in terms of work and emotional labour that I don’t have time to sit down and be sad. I don’t have the time to let it consume me, but it’s still… there.

I’ve always felt like I’m going to go out by my own hand, and it feels like it’s going to happen when my duties to everyone around me are done. Like when I’m not needed anymore, I can go with no guilt.",1755207883.0,166,62,BPD,bpd

the acne and redness on me is awful to look at, on top of being VERY pale, and i think i need to go home. i came out here alone to get away from my usually routine of staying home because it gets boring, but im really bored here too.

at least it looks pretty. unfortunately, i don't. this is why i hate the summertime. no one will love me, and if they ever do like me they'll just be disgusted by me the moment I show my face in the outdoors. ",1755197573.0,18,9,BPD,bpd
1mqn14m,I feel stuck and it’s breaking me,"I feel so stuck in my relationship and I don’t know what to do. The other day I mentioned to my partner that I was uncomfortable with him following all these only fans girls and he sort of just laughed. He then specifically pointed out one that I get the most uncomfortable with because he interacts with her account the most and he told me “oh I like her a lot”. It broke me hearing him say all of this and he said he wasn’t going to unfollow because I was asking him to do something his exes forced him to do. I told him I wasn’t asking him to do anything and I was just expressing my feelings and he was just so dismissive of it and it somehow flipped to me apologizing for being uncomfortable with it and complaining to him about it. I care about him so much but I’ve mentioned this issue to him before and he just doesn’t care. He’s willing to let this relationship end over girls that don’t even know he exists, just so he can continue following them on instagram. He plays it off as “I’m not with them, I’m with you” but I know if he could, he would be with them. I don’t want things to end between us but it’s also been stuck on my mind since that night and it’s just a terrible feeling. He also rarely texts or calls me so we hardly communicate during the day. He responds the fastest when I say goodnight and I hate it. All of these cons but I don’t know how to let him go because when we are together in person I feel so comfortable with him and I can’t imagine being with anyone else but when we’re apart I feel like he just doesn’t care about me at all. He says it’s not just physical but that’s what it feels like because he feels so emotionally distant. It hurts and I don’t know how to move on from him, I slowly feel myself losing feelings but even with that, I just remember how I feel when I’m in his arms and I get stuck again.

1mqcnnu,I know I have BPD but I don’t understand why fully,"Sorry, this will be long. I just feel lost right now. I was diagnosed with BPD last year at 21 and am 22 now, I’ve suspected it since around age 17 but showed symptoms prior to that, although less extreme than they are now. I met nearly all the criteria except I think one, and my behavior is pretty much textbook BPD. I have extreme limerence during and after all my relationships, feel empty without an FP, am almost always wildly depressed, do impulsive things to fill that void, and have shown extremely obsessive and anxious behavior towards nearly all the close friends and relationships in my life. 

Anyways, that’s a small portion of my symptoms but you get the idea. The thing is I’m constantly feeling as if my childhood wasn’t bad enough to develop it and that’s what kept me from bringing it up for awhile until my symptoms got worse and worse. I know I’ve read it can stem from an invalidating environment which I definitely had however. I grew up in a very rural small and conservative town of 7,000 people with a conservative and religious family. I don’t remember being well liked at school, I never really had close friends my whole life like many at my school despite growing up with the same 150 people my whole life and remember feeling very negatively about school.

I feel I was close with my family until around age 11 or 12 when I began to get very depressed, and when I distanced myself from their beliefs or what they wanted me to be I felt judged for it. My mom has always been caring towards me and shown that she loves me but we have such different perspectives and I feel genuinely uncomfortable when I stay with them and always feel there’s something they have to subtly criticize about me because I am no longer Christian and have a sort of alt style and different political beliefs. My mom has also shown very obsessive behavior towards me when I showed concerning behavior while away in college by doing things like logging into my accounts to read my texts and search history, and messaged me from a fake account in my last year of high school which she told me about years later and apologized. My dad kinda just backs her up on anything and they’re together but he rarely communicates with me while she does everyday.

I don’t feel that she was this bad in my childhood but maybe it’s because I followed everything they wanted me to be. She’s also constantly bringing up how she misses how things used to be and misses when I was a child or when I liked her. She also doesn’t really believe I could have mental illness I don’t think and when I brought up the possibility of ADHD, her and my dad took a test for me by inputting what they thought my answers would be and told me I don’t have it because “she knows me better.” I just keep hearing extreme trauma has to happen to develop BPD and I feel guilty for having all these terrible symptoms and things I’ve done when I haven’t gone through half the terrible things many with the same diagnosis as me have. Like yeah my parents have done wrong but my mom cares about and supports me and I just feel like I don’t have any justification for how miserable I feel all the time. I’m constantly analyzing my life and childhood to figure out why I’m like this but I can’t. Any advice would be appreciated.",1755204252.0,7,12,BPD,bpd
1mq9814,"I'm often upset about something, does it ever stop?","I've been to therapy for several years and I did a DBT, both of which helped a ton and I must say I can manage my symptoms pretty well but one thing that is soo stubborn is me getting upset over small, superficial things on a daily basis. The few rare days when I don't get upset at all, feel like heaven and I wish every day was like that.

But nope! If I'm lucky, I will only get upset once or twice and will get over it quickly by realising what's happening and that it's not actually the end of the world! But more often than not, it DOES feel like it's the end of the world. Here are some of the reasons I almost had a breakdown lately:
- my partner dropped something on the floor, he must not appreciate that I cleaned the floor 2 days ago!
- the table we sat at was in the middle of the restaurant and I felt too exposed, obviously everybody is going to watch ME get messy while eating a burger
- my coworker forgot to clean up something minor, of course I have to get all mad and upset as if I don't sometimes forget things.. and the list goes on.

I'm so tired of being SO damn upset over small things, they don't actually matter, none of them but they feel like such a huge deal.. Does it ever completely go away? Will I be able to have a week where I don't get all mad and upset? I feel like it already got soso much better, I'm afraid that's it and I'm stuck with those feelings forever.",1755196817.0,11,2,BPD,bpd

This is the first sub where I feel I can be wholeheartedly myself without any filter, and I've never felt like this before. Many of the posts on this sub are so relatable and I feel like I'm unlocking a part of myself that I didn't know existed. Of course I still feel the pain I've been feeling for months, even years. But I find this forum helps me attach my feelings to what could be going on, and gets me through the day and night when I feel overwhelmed.

1mqicb8,Struggling with feelings for my ex of 2.5 years,"Hi everyone,

I'm feeling so confused and stuck right now.
I (25F) broke up with my ex (28M) over two and a half years ago. We dated very chaotically for about 5 years and I ended up breaking up with him because I needed too at the time I felt like I was trapped after too many things had happened in the relationship from both sides, worth noting ! was 18F and he was 21M at the time we met.

Since then we've had this ongoing open line of communication where l'd always reply if he reached out. Like ALWAYs. Recently I sent him a long message about how I'm moving away to Paris (I don’t know for how long but I’ve been stuck in my home city which is a small town) And goodbye I probably won't see you again/ I care about you deeply and think about you a lot etc etc.

And his response? basically a ""good luck, I'm doing great and I'm seeing someone else you will be surprised at how easy it is"" kind of thing.
I think he's blocked me now because I did reply quickly but nothing came back.

We've had contact this year for a solid month and even made plans to see each other, but I realised it was a bad idea (it was my fault) and cancelled at the last minute. We also hooked up once last year.
I'm saying this to express how we were always on and off in contact and had agreed we would always be there if we needed one another.
Since then, it's like my brain has gone into overdrive. I wake up thinking about him. I dream about him. He pops into my head every few minutes. I thought l'd moved on, but it feels like I've been dragged back in time. I don't understand why it's hitting so hard now, or why he can just magically not reply to me when I always answered him before when he needed me.

To make things even more overwhelming, l've been in another relationship since then for 6 months, but he suddenly got cancer 25M. This entire year has been a nightmare of hospital stays and caretaking. And it's not the first time I've lost people. I'm honestly exhausted. I care about my current partner a lot but obviously the relationship got very serious very quickly and there was no way I could leave his side with what he had been diagnosed with. 

I'm supposed to be going to Paris soon, but right now I don't even know how to exist in the meantime. How am I ever supposed to get over this? Will it ever stop hurting like this? Even this year he would say things like we are soulmates and soul ties. Now he’s just aired me out like I’m nothing but some learning exercise. I feel sick. 

Any insight, coping tools, or even just stories of recovery from this living hell. He shaped everything about me and I feel connected to him to the point where I am crying writing this.

I can respond in comments to more background info on my ex and my relationship. He had episodes of mania and it was a very toxic relationship but we did eventually grow up and get through it. Now I just feel like it was all for nothing (for me anyway) he seems to be fine. ",1755217716.0,3,0,BPD,bpd
1mq65ba,I have finally gotten a BPD buddy.,"For a very long time, I have been struggling to find someone who understands my thought process, my feelings, and my unique way of approaching life. I have had partners and I have had friends who, no matter how much I express what I mean, just do not understand in the slightest why and how I think the way I do. They consider it irritating at worst and at best, completely confusing. Sometimes it's debilitating because the urges and thoughts I get to seek revenge or leave is really self-consuming and guilt-ridden. When I express this to people it is often met with complete misunderstanding or irritation. This has made me yearn for years of someone who can understand what I go through and is at the same stage I am. Where I understand that my urges are something I don't want and I am no longer committing unintentional harm toward others. I have made friends with other sufferers in the past, but none of them quite were at my point in the road.

I finally found someone who is and it's so relieving. We can talk about our experiences without judgement, we can understand how we think, and we can look back on past relationships with nuance. We can recognize our areas that we need to grow in and areas we have overcome. It's so humbling to have someone that FINALLY thinks the same way you do. That FINALLY won't judge you because of urges or thought processes. It's so, so, SO nice.",1755190309.0,11,5,BPD,bpd
1mq8mg1,How to move past the end of an FP.,"Just really fucking struggling. She wasn't even a great friend. She constantly broke promises and refused to make time for our friendship. I didn't ask for much, an hour every couple weeks to watch a show or play a game and to put a bit more effort into talking to me.

She was bullied and abused by our friend group into leaving. I lashed out at all of them and stood up for her. Months later she went back and promised to keep me excluded as terms to be welcomed back.

We kept fighting because she was being a shit friend and making me feel like I was the problem because I was hurting and she didn't want to do the bare minimum to be a decent friend. Finally we blew up in July and she's blocked me on everything. 

I hate her for betraying me. But I still love her for how close we became over the winter. I tried to kill myself in June over this and it's because of her I'm in therapy and trying to get better all because she told me too.

I don't want to wake up every day thinking about her. I don't want to go to bed thinking of her. I don't want this FP bullshit consuming how I feel every fucking day.

I just want to know why I wasn't worth enough for her to be a better friend. I want to know why all the fighting I did on her behalf was so easy for her to forget just so she could have a group of friends who don't like her in the first place.

I want to know how to move on because it's coming on a year of agony around these people and I can't live like this anymore.",1755195507.0,8,0,BPD,bpd
1mqkq33,How do you become happier (or feel anything other than the void)?,"Every day I either feel super empty or sad/angry for no reason. It's so tiring feeling so apathetic to everything around me. My hobbies/obsessions don't bring me joy anymore, I hardly have any friends anymore (basically 0 IRL ones at that. most of my attempts fall apart), me and my FP are barley on speaking terms after an awful friendship breakup I caused, can't drive so i cant go anywhere fun that often, I completley split on my therapist for no reason and haven't been in a while. It's exhausting, and I'm just so tired of living like this. SO tired of it.

Every once in a while, I get this burst of energy to ""reset"" my life and work towards changing it (setting goals, changing my wardrobe/glow up, being the better and happier person i aspire to be etc), but this is usually at 3AM when it's too late to do anything substantial, and too short-livied before the awful emptiness hits me and im back to having no motivation to do anything at all. Binge eating, spending money and sleeping, are the only things that make me feel less empty, but obviously, that's NOT healthy.

Anyway, I guess I'm seeking some support. I want nothing more than to completley change my life and just be happier and enjoy life, but it's so hard when I *physically* feel this empty void weighing me down and nothing I do can fill it. That void has been there since I was a child, and I'm just so tired of it. I hate being on the verge of tears all day every day for no reason, or being desperate for attention from anyone only to feel abandoned, or snapping at/pushing away people I love because my mood is in the gutter. The happiness I do feel is very short-lived. My mood is all over the place all day and I want it to stop.

If anyone has any tips on how they've gotten happier with this disorder, or simply how to not feel completley empty and sad all the time and actually enjoying things in life, please let me know! I want to change so bad it hurts.",1755224166.0,2,5,BPD,bpd

1mqels1,Pattern Theory Cycle,"A couple months ago I was discharged from DBT after 2.5 years. I knew I needed to get another therapist but didn't have an agenda other than ensuring that my DBT skills didn't fall to the wayside. I'm also concerned with how quickly I can become emotionally dysregulated. My DBT therapist believed I'd benefit from more trauma treatment including addressing my childhood.

I got a new therapist, she did her own intake with me and she believes I don't often know what triggers me. She believes I'm being triggered as a result of childhood trauma. She also believes I lack self-awareness.

My therapist has recommended I work on something called the ""Pattern Theory Cycle (PTC)"". 

For those of you unfamiliar, PTC *""refers to recurring sequences of events, behaviors, or emotions that reinforce themselves over time, often stemming from early experiences or beliefs.""*

According to Google, here's a breakdown of how pattern theory cycles work:

1. Trigger: A specific event or internal thought (trigger) initiates the cycle. 

2. Emotional Response: The trigger elicits a particular emotional response (e.g., anxiety, anger, shame).

3. Behavior: The emotional response leads to a specific behavior (e.g., withdrawal, defensiveness, aggression).

1mqixt9,"Wanting to Not Smother My Partner Who Has BPD, But Also Wanting to Support Them the Best Way Possible","[ON THIS ACCOUNT TO KEEP IDENTITY OF BOTH OF US HIDDEN]

I (23M) am trying to support my girlfriend (22F) the best way I can and I’m just trying to look for the best advice I possibly can on here. We’re a relatively new couple, and have been talking quite a bit (nearly daily) since April. And the feelings and emotions we shared for each other were undeniably different than anything either of us have experienced. She told me early on about her BPD and I told her that it didn’t make me see her in any different light and that I’d love her no matter what (which I absolutely still do). She warned me on multiple occasions that she’d eventually try and push me away or shut me out, but I figured, “well I’m me, it shouldn’t be that big of a problem”.


Well past naive me was quite wrong, because I haven’t changed much of my mannerisms around her (I’ll get into the “changed much” portion later), and I’ve even tried offering support and open communication about whatever; and she’s blocking me out no matter how I try and approach her. And I know her well enough to notice the differences in her body language when there’s something she’s hiding and when she’s genuine, and any time I try and find out what’s on her mind she’s giving me the body language that she’s hiding her emotions. And it’s killing me because I know that there’s something, even if it’s dumb, but there’s something on her mind; but she won’t ever say. 


This leaves me second guessing a lot of moves that I make in our new, fragile relationship. And I’m terrified that she will shut me out for good. But this woman means too much to me, we’ve connected on levels I never thought I had in me. She’s brought creativity back into my life, she’s motivated me regarding my career to places I never thought were possible. And all of this change since April, and dating her since June. I mean she’s incredible and the Woman I know I want to marry. 


But we had a moment the other night (referencing that earlier pint I said I’d reroute on) where she shut down on me out of no where, and it caused me to completely spiral in front of her, causing a commotion and keeping us up at night (we both have to wake up super early for work). And I feel like my breakdown has caused this massive wave which has been difficult to navigate through, up to this point. I will intentionally reframe from the details I mention, out of respect of her privacy, and mine. But how it started was the body language I was receiving during an intimate moment, which felt forced for her to do from my perspective (looking back at the moment, I think she may have been having a decline in emotions) but she kept telling me everything was ok. Although I wasn’t seeing that, and I didn’t feel comfortable continuing because she didn’t look into it, so I backed off and since then its created this strange tension. I got every emotional and started spiralling and couldn’t handle myself, and she was lost trying to deal with her own emotions and thoughts, while appearing annoyed toward me for being a wreck. All this after an extremely long day for herself. 

Since then, I’ve tried to keep conversation light, I’ve been trying to reassure my love towards her, and she’s been receptive of my love. But never omitting any back, which is okay. I can understand why she needs time still, but it leaves me thinking, “am I messing up?” “Am I doing too much perhaps?” And I don’t know what to do. The last thing I want to do is lose this woman. She means everything to me, she’s my end game. If it’s not her, then it’s nobody for me.

Literally since the incident (last night) I purchased a book, “Loving Someone with BPD” by Shari Manning and have also joined this Reddit group to learn about different stories and experiences on BPD. 

Whatever mistakes or poor communication I’ve done please lay in on me. Any foolish remarks and bad blunders I’ve done I need to know. There’s nothing you could say to me that I probably haven’t said in front of the mirror once before. And the Woman is worth all of it to be with her. I need to know what I can do better for us, this girl means so much to me. I love her so much.

ive been with my boyfriend for almost a year now. things are mostly great. when they're good, they're amazing. but sometimes he'll just say or do something and my whole body is filled with this inexplicable rage and it literally hurts. and i feel horrible, i don't want to feel this way, but i do, and it gets so intense that i literally can't stop myself from lashing out. we just had an argument today where he made a ""joke"" about being friends with girls who flirt with him. it triggered me really badly because i was already frustrated at something else and the joke just didn't come off at all as a joke to me. he told me not to take my anger out on him after i snapped at him, and i said ""let's not talk then. bye."" (i do tend to isolate whenever im extremely upset because i need time to regulate and feel okay to handle situations properly. he knows this. it's been an issue before where i disappear without telling him, he gets upset. i tried telling him this time.) but then he said ""dude"" and started on a thing about how i was being so defensive and i couldn't just apologize for taking my anger out on him. i literally couldn't hold in the rage. ive felt it multiple times when stuff like this happens, but it was so bad this time. i was shaking and i felt physically violent towards myself and objects. i ended up texting him paragraphs about how i wanted him to leave me the f alone and that it didn't have to be an argument but now he kept texting so it is an argument. he then replied with another paragraph about how he thought the joke was obvious and i sounded like i was trying to avoid the situation and how i still hadn't apologized. 
i genuinely don't know what to do. the rage is suffocating. when it comes, there's literally nothing i can do. i NEED to isolate immediately. im still not even over it, im still so angry at him for not just letting me be. he says to tell him when i need to isolate which is already so hard for me and i feel like even when i do he still doesn't get it. and i constantly hear from him, when i feel this rage, the classic ""walking on eggshells"" and ""why are you so defensive"" and it just makes me even more angry. i literally feel my face getting warm as im typing this. i don't know what to do. i don't even know if i have bpd but it's the only thing that makes sense. im never even like this when im not in a relationship. yeah, i get mood swings, but i never feel like THIS when im single. and it goes for basically all of my relationships too. ive never maintained one this long, because every man ive ever chosen has cheated or sa'd me, but relationships always bring out these miserable behaviors in me. i need advice. i feel so clueless and helpless.",1755210582.0,3,3,BPD,bpd

I'm 31f, diagnosed with autism since childhood, but I also relate to the symptoms of 'discouraged' BPD and ADD. While I believe my autism has had a massive impact on my life, I don't feel that it explains everything. For example, most autistic women I knew had loads of friends who are also neurodivergent and are brought together by their special interests, whereas I can't seem to find a common ground with anyone based on interests alone, as I don't have a profound knowledge of my 'special interests' because they change so frequently and I never fully stick to anything without getting bored or too depressed to continue.

I also had a friend diagnosed with BPD when she was young and she thought she may actually be autistic.

I know there is a lot of overlap with the symptoms, plus I know some people feel that BPD is often misdiagnosed when they really have autism. However I do want to know if anyone has any experience with getting a BPD diagnosis after an autism diagnosis?

i probably will delete this soon, i just want some advice and if i dont respond to anyone i apologise im feeling a little low and i just dont normally interact with people on reddit i mostly just stalk posts


hi im 17(F) my bf is 18, im not diagnosed with bpd but I do feel that I am struggling with someething and have been looking into alot of things to try to understand myself better. I apologise if this is the wrong community I just feel that alot of my behaviour aligns best with some people here so it may be helpful to get some input from people who are diagnosed. i want to apologise if anything i write in this post is rude, ignorant or if i have written anything wrong that should not be posted in this subreddit (i dont use reddit too much besides just scrolling) I just really need some advice right now.

im in a family where they are very dismissive of things like this but my main issue is currently with my longterm boyfriend of 2 years.

for some context
my relationship with my parents arent good, i spiral over any interaction with them and have a meltdown even if its just over something small like them simply commenting on my room when its messy. If they arent as efficient as me I will also begin to get impatient and start yelling at them and this has led to me virtually having no connection with my parents and i understand that this is absolutely horrible behaviour nor am i trying to justify it with anything i may be struggling with, I simply feel that I am not a good daughter and have been trying to distance myself, this leads to more arguments as i get annoyed when they try to reach out after i ask for space.

The big issue is I feel these behaviours are starting kick in with my bf. We are long distance now since the start of this year. I have always been able to hide most of my annoyance with him when he doesnt respond or does something wrong, as I know these are me being too dependent on him/spiralling over the wrong things (hes emotionally very unintelligent so I try to understand things from his POV) but recently he confessed that I hadnt been as affectionate and its been making me overthink and wonder if Im starting to affect him. 

for context 
ive been getting pretty irritated with him lately just because hes not as efficient as me in a game, aswell as the fact that he refuses to wear headphones even though ive explained that the audio feedback that happens when hes on speaker irritates me as he cant even understand me clearly sometimes, i understand this is a small issue but it just annoys me. he also has a habit where he just doesnt respond/spaces out when im talking to him over call. It also annoys me that he wakes up at 5pm my time daily even though we are only at a 2 hour time difference as we barely get a chance to talk than. When we argue i tend to want to keep arguing even if hes already apologised, as i still feel angry. 

So genuine question, I am aware my behaviour is super self destructive and Ive been trying to be honest with my bf about it all but right now I feel I should give him distance and seek help as I really feel he deserves the world, ive mentioned this to him before and hes seems against the idea as he really doesnt wanna lose me and would rather stick with me and try to help but I wonder if maybe it should be better for the both of us :(

I was scared and doing what I thought I was supposed to be doing-telling someone who cared about me. I had no intent to control. I honestly was really scared by the feelings and not getting the support I needed in IOP at the time. I don’t think I knew what I wanted or needed in those moments. However, my ex might not have realized that. They might have thought I wanted them to do something specific when that wasn’t the case. 

I’ve been told by my therapist, coach, and hotlines that suicidal ideation isn’t abusive if I’m not saying it to get a reaction. That I can cause harm without intent, and it isn’t the same as abuse.

But is that true? To be clear, I never said I’d off myself if they didn’t do something. I wasn’t aware I was affecting them negatively, and they never expressed how I was affecting them. If I knew, I definitely would have changed my behavior earlier. 


Also, I worry that labeling suicidal behavior as abusive is kind of criminalizing it. I worry that the fear of upsetting family members or being labeled abusive could prevent people from seeking treatment out of fear that they won’t ask the “right way”. So where’s the line?

Yet, there’s still a disconnect. My parents, my mom namely, still uses the “walking on eggshells” and “I never know what to say to you” thing whenever I say I’m upset over something she’s said or done—but in the most recent instances of this, I’ve been rather level-headed and hardly even triggered. Merely been stating how I feel, trying to be the one that fosters constructive convos (as my therapist has expressed, communication in my family needs work. So, I try). But she still feels the need to blame any of these shortcomings or her mistakes on my illness, on my misremembering things or not thinking clearly (as I’ve admittedly done while splitting/during episodes). I find she’s been trying to use that to escape accountability when I’ve perceived any arguments or altercations between us rather lucidly.

1mpo17m,Weird things I’ve noticed with my BPD,"(Trigger warning: some mentions of sexuality)

So since I was diagnosed last August, I haven’t really fully understood BPD until very recently (when I started therapy for it). I haven’t noticed several things about my BPD, and I was curious if anyone else has shared any of these experiences.

Firstly, did anyone else upon being diagnosed immediately think, “I don’t remember any trauma or something that could have caused this.”? I couldn’t comprehend until much later that some things I dismissed or ignored were actually traumatic for me, and were part of the reason I have BPD.

Secondly, does anyone else experience hyper-sexuality exclusively geared towards ‘helping’ the other person? I don’t know if that is exclusively a me thing or if that is a bpd thing; sometimes it is hard to tell. Also, I have noticed that sometimes I just have a desire to go ‘interact’ with other people outside of my partner; I haven’t (and won’t), but I’m curious as to if others share that feeling. (Of note, this is only occurring when my partner and I are long distance, when we are physically near each other, I don’t have these feelings).

Thirdly, does anyone else with BPD lack motivation? And if so, how do you deal with it? I really would like to be able to do things, but sometimes it is like pushing a stone up a mountain to do anything.

1mqhy8o,Help!! I need advice,"So.. back in February I was “technically” diagnosed with BPD. I’ve been showing borderline symptoms that have gotten increasingly worse over the years without treatment that has landed me in the hospital, and I’ve wanted help for so long but haven’t gotten it because I was too scared to talk about my symptoms, in fear of being looked at as an attention seeker. I’m 17, turning 18 very soon, and a lot of people my age think they have BPD on apps like TikTok and don’t understand that typical teenage experiences may sometimes feel extreme and look like BPD. I don’t want to be grouped into that entire circle. I have environmental and genetic factors tying into it and explaining it perfectly

I was hospitalized the second time this past year after a psychotic episode. While there, multiple psychiatrists agreed that I had BPD, and my therapist told me that it finally clicked for her as well, after two years of seeing her. I’m also diagnosed with autism so expressing my feelings verbally is really hard for me, and she admitted that while she agreed I had something going on with me that wasn’t “just autism and mood dysregulation”, she couldn’t pin point it until it was reported back that they’re all on the same page of me having BPD

Thing is, it’s not in my chart. My main psychiatrist told me that while it’s agreed that I’m borderline and they were arranging a treatment plan with a behavioral specialist, he wasn’t going to give me the label and I never heard back from the behavioral specialist program :/. I finally have a new psychiatrist, but I’m unsure how to bring up the topic of BPD without feeling ashamed of myself. It’s not that I WANT the disorder, it’s that multiple professionals have cross examined me at one of the highest ranked hospitals and universities in the COUNTRY and have agreed that I’m borderline, and I WANT help desperately. I just want clarification, does that make sense? 

Before I got diagnosed formally with autism last November I was losing my mind because despite my therapist and psychiatrist agreeing that I was autistic, it wasn’t “formally diagnosed”. And so I couldn’t explain it to anybody, and I couldn’t ask for help. I felt so lost and confused for an entire year because I was being told I 100% had something, and yet I couldn’t talk about it. I don’t want the disorder, I want clarity and closure. I just want to know how I go about talking to my new psychiatrist. He asked me if *I* thought I was borderline, and I wasn’t honest, saying “I don’t know, just because I’m no professional..”. I want closure but will I be looked at as this attention seeking teen? I’m already diagnosed with so many of the TikTok mental disorder wishlist illnesses, and so I don’t want to seem like I WANT something to be wrong :/",1755216698.0,1,2,BPD,bpd

1mpys7h,I pushed away the one person who was there for me — now I’m afraid to get close to anyone,"Hello everyone. I'm a guy and this disorder has completely taken over my life. On top of it, I also have PTSD and some other conditions that make living very difficult. I’m from Ukraine, and after losing loved ones and my home, I moved to the UK, to the seaside. I was completely alone when I met a good guy — I never thought I could love someone that much. He was very kind to me, we would always go for walks together, and during a difficult moment in my life, he took me in. I will always remember and think back to our trips to the pub, our walks by the sea, how we ran through the streets with the wind breaking our umbrellas.

One day, I fell into crisis again. I was already living separately, I lost my job, and I also started having problems with my housing because I could no longer afford to pay for it. I drank and wrote to him: “I don’t want to see you anymore, I’m sorry for the time I wasted on you, I hope your friends will understand who you really are.” And that was only because he had been busy for several weeks and hadn’t written to me.

The next morning, I went to him to apologize, but he no longer wanted to talk to me, so I wrote him a letter. Later, I felt terrible again, drank again, and wrote him the same thing. He cut off all contact with me. I couldn’t control myself, and this state lasted a week. I asked to meet so we could exchange all the gifts we had given each other over the past year. He came, and I apologized again, but he advised me to seek psychiatric help (which I obviously need urgently). In tears, I threw his gifts on the ground and left.

I cried for several days and lost a very good friend. He still doesn’t write or reply to my messages. Since then, I’ve been afraid to get close to people so as not to hurt them or myself. I don’t drink, I exercise, I try to distract myself from everyone I have hurt and find a way to accept that no one is obliged to tolerate my outbursts.

Later, I left all the gifts I had given him at his house and wrote, “Thank you for everything. I’m very sorry that you witnessed my terrible behavior; I never meant to hurt you and by no means do I consider the time we spent together a waste.”

1mqbgog,I just had a suspicion of diagnosis,"Hello everyone ! English isn’t my first language, sorry

I, 25f , recently got told by my psychiatrist that I probably have bpd. However, I don’t believe in this diagnosis.

For context, I’ve seen my psychiatrist for about 4 months now, and I came to her with my own suspicion of having autism and adhd. I did a lot of research and I am definitely certain to have either each or one of em. This is the first psychiatrist that tries to do a diagnosis with me.

When she asked me questions for the autism, I couldn’t answer a lot of them regarding my childhood because I have deep traumas that affect my memory. 

When she told me “the specialist is not leaning to an autism diagnosis, but rather a bpd one”. I was baffled. Shocked. Disappointed. Lost.
This term, “borderline” have a deep deep connotation to me because my father weaponised it to call my mother crazy as part of the abuse. 

I think she leaned to this diagnosis because I have a very hard time controlling my emotions, I feel everything and nothing at the same time, I have a deep sense of void and I tend to attach a lot to certain people, going from loving to hating them then loving them back at any mistake.

I Know this is a very layered disorder, but I can’t feel anything but fear. And anger. Am I gonna be okay ? Am I being misdiagnosed because I’m a queer woman ? Am I being put in a box “do not touch”? I’m so f scared, I feel like a lost child again. I don’t want to be borderline, but I want something to lean on.

I know I’m not the only one feeling like this, but it feels so alone. I’m so angry and sad. If you have any advice, it’ll be appreciated.

1mqgm43,How to go from here?,"Hey everyone. 
So I'm going through a ""seperation/breakp"" with both my current FP (we were never dating but more than friends/fwb) and a mutual friend group/online community. 

Last night I was removed from an online community that was my connection with my online friends (including my fp) since thats where we all hang out. The reason why was because I trust too easily and I overshare. None of this is to start drama or out of spite, I just talk and trust. 
As my FP and I had some complications between us and also different approaches to a social situation that involved the community/friend group, we fought a lot. And I was so scared of losing him. With this, I tried searching for answer... through people thats known him longer (I became friends with this group through my fp) to see advice on the situation. 

Again, no negative intention. I just needed to talk and need support/advice. Well, FP wanted to keep our ""dynamic"" more private and not in the knowledge of the online platform (you know how they are. Stuff spreads like wild fire). As we fought more or I got more afraid of losing him so I talked more and more. I eventually ended up telling the wrong person, whom I thought I could trust, who had twisted things and said that I was saying these awful things and lies about my FP regarding our dynamic. Which ofc betrayed FP's trust and FP is feeling hurt and betrayed.
(Which I didnt realize or mean to but I did and I take accountability for that) 
He has mentioned multiple times not to mention it to people of this online community (ive only ever told people within the friend group). So his trust was betrayed. 
Also I lost another friend in the friend group due to these twisted lies being told that made her uncomfortable (if it fully doesnt make sense, youre not the only one. Im still very confused what has been sad and who said it. And how we got to this extreme so fast). 

So FP is distancing himself from me and I lost my place in the friend group. I feel alone, as this is my place to hang out and feel like I belong, and im heartbroken and sad. 

I COMPLETELY understand that I broke his trust and thay I hurt him. I have acknowledged this to him and apologized. I know where my faults lie and I am taking accountability for everything that I know I did wrong. 

I am writing this because I want advice on how to move forward, heal myself, fix things with my FP and friends.. 

I know I'm very vague on this so its hard to give advice but I am trying to keep the information as private as I can but always wanting to reach advice from others..

1mq97sl,Nobody loves me because I'm too emotional,"Why is the world so afraid of emotions. Even the small normal ones, like sadness, annoyance, anger. The world rejects the small emotions and shove them back down my throat and make me feel like I'm deeply, intrinsically flawed for feeling. Nobody loves me when I'm emotional. Nobody loves me when I need help. They only love a fake, perfect version of me that bends to what they need, hiding myself inside.

So then the emotions—and myself, inside—those things grow. They fester so big I can't keep them secret anymore. And then I freak out. The emotions have nowhere to go, they explode out of me and everybody leaves me because they really can't deal with the monster inside. All anybody wants is a perfect, happy facade of a person. I feel I am one of the only people who really wants to be there for people exactly they are, in all the ugliness, because I know how awful this loneliness feels and I want there to be less of it in the world. Before I die I just want to know one person—at least one, hopefully more—has felt less alone because of me. Because in general, people suck. People abandon other people. The world is lonely, wrapped up in its need for emotionless perfection.

I have had problems with three big, dangerous issues so far. Two behavioral, one chemical. As soon as I get over one, another comes to replace it. Another obsession, another dark savior with its hands out in the night to accept me. And the people who have found out want to know what's wrong with me. They shove the shame back in my face. Why do you need these things? Why can't you just be perfect without any help? Because I need something for me, darn it. I need something inside to make me feel soothed every once in a while. I need a friend who loves me even when I'm emotional. And people aren't strong enough for that. Only the vices, only the things that have a dark side waiting to hurt or kill me after I'm done basking in the comfort—only those things, being strong enough to harm me, are also resilient enough to hold my hazardous levels of pain.

I have a degree in clinical psychology and have tried to work in the field. Even in this field that is supposed to provide a safe place for people's pain, I see the toxic need to ignore it. To fit people into boxes, shut them down, take their insurance card, to make money off of pain. Money, which will help shallow high-up people live shallow lives and abandon others with their pain, and continue this illusion of perfection, and hurt the bleeding core of the world with their pride.

1mqf5he,Feeling betrayed,"My ex split up with me a couple weeks ago because we’d had a few disagreements. This in turn caused a bit of a rift in our friendship group, the only one I had, and between the two it’s been a constant spiral of mood swings and self destructive behaviours. This made things worse, and it ended up in me taking a week to step back to try and pull myself through.

Last night I felt okay enough to reach out to one friend, and it was going relatively okay at the start. Still strained, but some things were talked out and it seemed like a little bit of progress had been made towards fixing things. 

However, I ended up in another dark spot a few hours later and in my vulnerability I ended up venting to this friend about everything - stuff I’d never trusted anyone enough to disclose to them. I told them about my constant mood swings, my long going fears of abandonment, the constant “love-hate” feelings I have with everyone in my life, most notably with my ex. I told them that despite all of that, I truly love my ex, felt immense guilt and shame over the feelings of hate, didn’t truly hate them deep down, and I wanted to work on getting better to hopefully give things another go in the future when I’ve gotten the help I need, something I’m in the process of getting.

They didn’t fully understand what I meant, and ended up making assumptions about some missing pieces. They also went to my ex behind my back and told them about everything I’d told them, however leaving out the part where I said that I despised those feelings of hate and that I wanted to work on sorting myself out. So basically to them it looked like “I had a lot of times where I hated them”, and nothing else. 

Now they all hate me - I’ve been called disgusting, a piece of shit etc. I’ve been told by my ex never to contact them again and I’ve been removed from everything. I feel so broken because I loved them with all of my heart and really wanted to get better for them, and I’ve lost the only friends I had left.

TL;DR: Split on staff member at college, feeling immense amount of guilt about it, wanting tips, skills, and support

Hello, I haven't posted too much on this website but I have been struggling with strong emotions after a split and thought I'd ask for some support. I'm currently in college and have been struggling a lot with accommodations for housing and an unsuspected program schedule that resulted in me splitting in the accessibility office. I struggle a lot with authority figures due to some issues in the past and also struggle to express my feelings when I'm overwhelmed due to a neurological condition, and all this combined led to the split within the office. I truly don't remember everything of what I said or did, but I did end up getting sent to the ER until I calmed down. After some time there I was sent home feeling relatively better, but after a meeting with the counselor today all those feelings came back up as I was being told about some of the things I apparently said relating to self harm. I identified the feelings as anger and ended up talking with someone above the person in the accessibility office in chain of command and was triggered when they mentioned the words ""You felt \[x\] said \[y\]"" as it made me feel like they were accusing me of lying. After a long discussion, I felt somewhat okay, and even hopeful, but now I feel extremely guilty for what I said. I feel like I already messed up my chances at succeeding in this school two days into the semester, and I honestly feel scared to even talk to the counselor because I don't want them to think of me with that split being what described me. My main goal is to just forgive (myself, the event) and forget, but I'm really struggling with not beating myself up over it. Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated, DBT skill suggestions as well would be more than welcome. I do have some people who I can talk to on campus (specifically the RA and officer that took me to the hospital) but I don't feel like I'm in the right headspace to talk about this to people at my school right now. 

Note: I don't know too much about specific terminology, so I use the word ""split"" to describe the event of seeing someone as pure evil with no room for nuance and a blackout/overly emotional/angry type episode.

He’s very sensitive and optimistic and has a healthy relationship with his family. We’ve been making long term plans and I felt like this was finally it for me after many abusive and toxic relationships. 

Him and I started dating after becoming fast friends, so at first I was afraid that he didn’t know me well enough. I let him convince me that we could work around anything.

I think I made a mistake in opening up to him about my trauma, including CSA from multiple adults as a child, because he said that having that knowledge is a “heavy weight” on him and it upsets him. I never meant to hurt him by telling him but he says he thinks about it all the time and doesn’t know what to do about it. 
I’m also a generally negative person and I am working in a field which I hate and I vent to him about it often…

We recently had a long talk where he told me that my negativity about everything weighs him down and that he loves me so much and wants me to be happy that it hurts him to see me so depressed and be unable to do anything about it. He was breaking down in tears as he said it and he didn’t mean it in a way that I felt he was putting the blame on me but it hurt. I felt so empty I didn’t even say anything and comforted him while he cried. But I’ve sat with it for a couple of weeks and I feel such a deep pit in my stomach for believing that he never knew me at all. In the years before I knew him I made a suicide attempt and I put myself through rigorous therapy and got to a point where I was no longer having thiughts of self harm every day. I was actually proud of myself last year for the progress I’d made with my mental health but I feel so stupid now because it feels like it was never enough.

1mq8ai4,Is there even a point of trying to live a healthy life and have a relationship?,"TW below suicide ideology 

I don’t have enough traits to meet the diagnosis of bpd but I exhibit many of the traits and struggle specifically with relationships. 

In every relationship I’ve ever been in, I have thoughts of “I don’t want to be in a relationship cause it’s so much easier to be single, then I don’t have to deal with any of these difficult thoughts and emotions as they wouldn’t exist in the first place.”

I’m in a relationship now and I feel like I’ve already ruined it. I love the guy a lot but I’m triggered by every little thing. If he has a change of tone, if he’s tired or cranky, if he uses specific words that indicate doubt about me, it sets me into an insecure panic. For example when he says the word “if”.  The other day he said “if we move in together” and I got sad because I would’ve wanted him to say “when”. Or “if we’re together at Christmas”, meaning ‘if we are spending time together at Christmas’, but I interpreted it as ‘if we are still a couple by then’. 

I can’t stop nitpicking at every little thing and although I don’t always react or say something about it in the moment, i still tend to shift my behaviour and he senses something is wrong. I suck at communicating what’s wrong and usually when I finally do say what it is, it ends up that he gets upset cause of my inability to communicate objectively. I also show my emotions and thoughts on my face and through my behaviour so he’s able to quickly notice something is wrong in the moment. The other day when I was overthinking about something he said, he told me I have a dead stare and he never knows what’s going through my head when I have that look. 

I think that this relationship won’t last because I’ve already ruined it by showing my insecurity, and that he is already second guessing being with me based on his “if” statements, even tho he also does things that indicate he DOES love me and wanna be with me - such as telling me that, or spending time with me, planning things with me, etc.

The thought of breaking up with him for legitimately no reason is not settling for me, but at the same time, I can’t see this relationship or any relationship going well. I think I’m better off alone and untriggered, but then it makes me wonder wtf is the point of life if the only way it’s manageable for me is to go it alone. I don’t feel a point to living because I can’t even enjoy the point to life which is to have relationships and friendships and be present with people etc. I have no active plans for un-aliving and I would never go about doing that, but I do wish that life and nature  would take its course and take me out of my misery. 

I am just ranting here and don’t expect advise per se or even false hopes of “it gets better”. I wish there was a magic thing I could do to just not be this way anymore and have a normal brain.

1mpx7mm,Just ended things with my bf,"Over the past few months my (f26) -now ex- boyfriend (m38) has consistently made me feel crazy for assuming that he has slowly lost interest in me. I’ve watched him put off important meaningful conversations with me over n over, even when it’s just me simply needing reassurance. He’s stopped really initiating sex with me and when we would have sex, I’m on top and after he’s done he basically lies there n doesn’t even try to touch me. He stopped asking me questions about myself n really getting to know me, although I’m not sure he ever started. He stopped making efforts to see me throughout the week when he used to pull up just to kiss me before i leave for work.  

We were together basically 6 months. I’ve tried having open honest conversations. Asking him if he’s bored of me, if he’s happy, that i feel like I’m constantly the one initiating sex. A few words of reassurance (probably just to shut me up) n then right back to the deep feelings of inadequacy. I’ve been spiraling off n on for the past couple months and begged for a sign to prove my feelings to be valid after making excuses for him. 

I’ve never went thru his phone. But i did look thru his drawer next to his bed over the weekend n saw 2 boxes of condoms that were all gone besides 1. Obviously im assuming he cheated. After calmly but shakily confronting him, he lied to my face n gaslighted me saying that they’re not his, he doesn’t know, and that he doesn’t even go thru his drawer ever. Lol . 

Eventually hours after i left his house and swearing that he’s never cheated, he texts me n tells me that he was feeling so lonely n depressed last week (WHILE I WAS THE ONE HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN) that he tried to make a “crackhead pocket pussy” . Whether or not this is the truth or a coverup, i obviously split again and tried to have 2 conversations with him since then about it to get a better understanding, though i kno i won’t be able to look past any of this considering how he handled the whole situation. Once again he brushes me off. I still find a way to say my peace albeit i have a LOT more i wanted to say. Full crash out mode. But i tried to remain as calm n civil as possible. And afterwards i hung up before he had the chance to respond.

i hope he feels terrible tho. And more importantly i hope he doesn’t spin it around to make me look crazy. He did have the nerve to say that he doesn’t think he could get past it either bc i went thru his drawer which is such a cop out excuse. Obviously i had valid reason n i dont regret it. But people, do not settle for anyone who isn’t going out of their way to show up for you. If you feel like they don’t really like you, and you have valid reason, chances are they don’t. We’re not always making shit up. We’re not always just paranoid n in our heads. I spent too much time gaslighting myself n making up excuses for him. I’m glad i found this out before wasting anymore time with him. I just soft blocked him on instagram n im going to try my best to just move on with my life n protect my peace.

1mpuqmn,"i fucked up real bad w my partner, pls help","I (20), have a horrible horrible reoccuring issue of being jealous, & taking it badly when my partner (20) cancels and/or turns down date plans with me. It’s basically a constant, that whenever it happens, I will sulk, no matter my partner’s reason or the circumstances (i can not even actually want to do the plans and i’ll sulk). The only difference is how well i do with managing it & how obvious it is to my partner. Which is to say, not very well. I often noticeably need to take space or ask my partner for reassurance that they actually like doing plans with me
This obviously is not healthy, especially given my partner has a pre existing self esteem issue, where they often blame themselves for things.

Today, me and my partner had been enjoying the day. It went wrong when i asked them to play multiplayer, they declined cause of the time, & i jealously brought up the fact that they recently played with friends until around that time. It spiraled from there as i kept pressing them about whether they genuinely wanted to multiplayer with me, and if they preferred me over their friends for hanging out usually. I kept pointing out contradictions to what they said before. I knew i should’ve stopped already, but downplayed things, and only did so when they mentioned they felt super shitty & guilty, but damage was already done. 
They still feel super guilty snd shitty undeserving to be with me. I obviously fucked up massively, I never should’ve done this to my own partner. I know i should do a lot better going forward & turn my act around asap (which i should’ve done already), but i’m feeling overwhelmed and dont know what to do

Please, any advice would be appreciated. I especially would appreciate advice in the case/situation that my partner stays with me & keeps dating me. please and thank you. I will probably delete this after a day or two because i don’t want to risk my partner seeing this & feeling more guilty (even though they did nothing wrong) ",1755159903.0,10,6,BPD,bpd

He said that he loves me. i’ve cut things off with him many times and repeatedly just stop talking to him after breaking no contact. I know I’m wrong in this. I’ve told him to block me so that I could stop doing the same thing over and over again. But he said he can’t. Each time, he welcomes me back with open arms but, I could also sense the resentment starting to grow. I think I care about him, I want him to do well and to succeed. I know I’m doing nothing but holding him back. But I’m always stuck thinking about him constantly. I don’t get it. I get mad at him and tell him off for random things he’s done and then come back crawling apologizing. It’s such an awful cycle and it makes me feel like a terrible person. I don’t get why I keep doing it. 

We had an argument a few days ago. I told him off for always making me feel like a villain when he’s not perfect either, I was harsh and it was irrational. He responded back with the same energy (which was fair) and I immediately wanted to just cry and apologize and beg him to forgive me. But I didn’t. I didn’t respond. He said something along the lines of how this won’t be our last conversation since I can’t let “us” end. I was asking my friend for advice and she was saying that he was being borderline manipulative because he knows the cycle I’m in and he’s only enabling my behavior instead of actually helping me. 

I don’t even know how I feel half the time. It feels like I grew up with everything inside my head feeling so tangled up and that I’m still in the process of unraveling it all. Part of me just wants to message him saying “I’m sorry”. It’s like I’m itching to reach out. I miss the feeling of comfort I get when I’m with him. But whenever I do get him back, I start splitting(?) and change how I feel about him. One second I’m giggling and blushing because he called me “baby” and the next I’m cringing because he says “I miss you”. Now I’m just staring at the ceiling wondering why I do the things that I do.

1mq9mjt,Questions about BPD,"Hello! I am someone who shares a partner with BPD. We’ve been dating for a long bit and I’ve been wondering  several things as our relationship has continued to evolve, and I thought I would ask them here.

- How common is self awareness with BPD? My partner is usually able to distinguish when ‘splitting’ (forgive the marks idk if that’s the official term?) and pinpoint exactly what caused it, but she still lacks the control to get out of it and avoid actions caused by it. Is this a normal thing with BPD-ailed people? Is growing this self awareness of knowing when certain BPD-related events are occurring good to mitigate the condition?

- Can BPD cause certain physical conditions like tics or nonverbalness. My partner has ADHD so I’m unsure if these conditions, which do happen a lot when she’s stressed out or in pain, are inherited from ADHD or BPD. 

- Is it normal for BPD-having people to avoid, I suppose, meaningful relationships? My partner was in a bad breakup a while ago and since then has vowed to never have a ‘favorite person’ (again, unfamiliar if this is the official term) ever again. I don’t particularly understand why you would avoid being close with your partner, and as a result, it’s lead to us being much more distant than that of a regular couple. Is the favorite person issue a matter of time, or is it a BPD related issue to avoid having ‘favorite people’?",1755197692.0,1,0,BPD,bpd

1mq28yy,What do you guys do when you feel bored? The BPD kind of boredom and emptiness.,"I hate the feeling of restlessness so much. I struggle a lot with staying still without the chaos. For the past 2 months I’ve been partying every single weekend and I knew the crash was coming when I eventually had to stop, which is now. And on top of that this past week has been absolute hell because of a situation I had been dealing with that completely triggered my abandonment wounds and just.. literally everything straight from childhood. 

I can’t keep drinking and blacking out and I can’t keep running away. I just don’t know what to do in the stillness of it all. The silence feels the loudest. I don’t want to keep hooking up mindlessly and just ruin myself further each time. It’s so hard not to do these things when I feel so bored and it’s not the normal type of bored. Those who get it, get it. 

Like I feel like self harming when there’s nothing going on or I’m unsure what to do. I’ve been so suicidal too because of the emptiness and lack of direction. And the realisation that I’ve had about how intense my BPD really is. It’s so overwhelming. 

I know it’s because I have to deal with all the pain and trauma when I stop running and it’s so much, but I have to. And I hate it all so much. That I even have to. So much has been coming up for me since I stopped and it’s been so heavy. It’s an endless cycle of realising how hard it is to heal from all the damage that’s been done to me since a kid, by everyone. It’s so hard to sit with the pain and revisit every wound that’s still bleeding. 

Bpd is so exhausting. I can’t even put it into words. 

Would greatly appreciate if you guys share some alternatives to these reckless coping mechanisms that help when you get bored and feel empty.

After my umpteenth breakup with my bf/fp/former fiancée, I am ready to call it quits. I wish there was a way to just passively survive in life without having to do anything besides lay in bed. The only thing that would normally get me out of bed is having to work (even though I call out all the time), or my bf wanting to hang out. Or needing more alcohol or weed. Even then I'm sometimes too passive to want to drive the 5 minutes to the store. But now I can't even fathom going into work and having to interact with anybody or follow their stupid rules anymore. Since my bf broke up with me I think its been 3 days, I called out of work 2 days in a row, then yesterday the 3rd day I showed up and then immediately left, because someone else had shown up thinking my shift time was theirs because they misread the schedule. I dont know why that made me so upset, but I basically said he's here now so you guys dont need an extra person for no reason. And I refused to come in for his shift because one, that's not when I was scheduled, and two my ex's friend is one of my coworkers and he has been ignoring me ever since my ex broke up with me. So I told my manager if I see that person its on sight. I want to tell my manager that I need a mental health break from work but I don't see the point, I'm not going to get better in a few days/a week. And my grandmother I live with will constantly be asking me about work if I don't leave the house for days and she doesn't need the added stress right now. I already did something to take revenge on my ex but I feel as though it wasn't enough. I want him to suffer like he made me suffer the last 3 years. All I wanted was to be happy with him but nothing was ever enough even when he said he was happy and that he loved me and wanted to be with me, he would get angry with me because he would always be ""bored"" and wanted something to do. AKA go out and spend stupid amounts of money on outings and food and drinks etc. It seems that was the only thing to keep him satisfied, as well as constant sex at least twice a day. He said he understood my sexual trauma and wouldn't push things, but always made me feel guilty and would completely shut down if I didn't want to have sex one day. I would not even go more than a day ""withholding"" sex from him but he felt that was a fair response.

However, my energy and mood swings, this feeling of emptiness, have been sobering. And I don't feel like we're targeting the symptoms of my BPD. Talking lets me have an outlet, but like many of us, so many of these symptoms are internal, physiological, and recurring despite how much we practice our skills (impulses are a big issue for me, despair, idolizing & de-valuing people/relationships, etc.). I'd really like to get out of the weeds of HAVING these behaviors in the first place. I imagine medication could help.

Have there been any psychiatric regimens (medications) that have helped you in your journey to remission?

1mphqdx,I feel like BPD can be way more disabling than people realize,"I feel like people forget that plenty of people with BPD have genuine support needs and that it’s not abuse of help. Like there’s this idea that you provide help so that someone can get back on their feet but for some that takes years or never happens.

I (20m) have BPD + ADHD and physical disabilities like fibromyalgia, I can’t work currently and trust me I have tried. 
if my parents didn’t provide for me I’d just be homeless or not here anymore, but they don’t provide as much support as I need to feel safe and make more mental health progress and it just makes me sad that so many families are like that, the moment they face a disorder they don’t understand they just blame their loved one. My parents have some understanding that I need help because so did my brothers but it was because they never gave us help before adulthood, I think they just didn’t want there to be a CPS case. 

My best friend understands and support me. She understands that I will be “too upset” and “too much” sometimes but as long as I’m not abusive towards her (hasn’t happened since we were adolescents and we have resolved our issues long ago ❤️‍🩹) she gives me the time and space while still being present for me, I don’t think people realize how much that matters when your brain is just scared and alone. 

My best friend and I have emotionally supported each other since we were kids due to our childhoods being so rough and isolating, it was unhealthy at times but we’re both in therapy now and have worked through most of that. She gives me a healthy amount of validation but knows to set boundaries and not over extend herself, while I work on setting my own boundaries and respecting her. 
She eventually wants to support me financially, and I would do the same for her, but I worry what that will look like longterm because that’s not considered common in US culture.

There are a couple issues though: I tried attending the hospital's refresher course but the environment just felt so uncomfortable and the leaders always talked down to me and cutting me off.  I had to leave because I didn't think I could contribute positively to the environment.

So the long and short of the situation is hat I can't afford a private DBT coach, I can't attend group, I'm on a very long wait list to \*maybe\* see someone at the clinic at some point, and I really struggle without set structure.

Does anyone have any tips on easing back in, or doing things at my own pace? Maybe like an online course or something?

1mpyp6b,I still hate myself,"Disclaimer; 

- I have been on an injection that induces a fake menopause to treat endometriosis for 2 months

- Have only just started HRT for it due to my mental health and fibromyalgia reacting badly to it and nhs being unreliable and am on my period (which you can still get during first 2 months of these injections). The HRT can make you feel worse at the start. 

I feel though like all of this is just bringing out how I truly feel more. I've been in a relationship with someone who bigs me up for a couple of years. We've had our issues but resolved them (despite me still having my bpd moments). We have a beautiful 1 year old daughter. I've had dbt 3 times which I DO practice (but no trauma therapy which I'm fighting to get as I also have complex ptsd). I'm on meds which also mostly help to stop self destructive behaviours alongside the dbt. I do push myself to be creative when I can.

I still hate myself. How I look, how I am. I envy the girls who can upload selfies of themselves doing the cheeky smiles and whatnot. My partner has friends who are like that. I'm not worried about him cheating but he's a very outgoing and generally positive guy and I'm sooo often a depressed/anxious mess. I never take pictures of myself because I have 0 confidence and the smile would be fake. I still wish I could force myself to put on a load of make up and do it to prove I could maybe look somewhat attractive at a certain angle or fake some confidence for one second. I feel like he could have done so much better than me. Maybe this is a pity party I dont know but I don't know if I will I ever begin to like myself and be genuinely happy 🥲 ",1755173009.0,2,2,BPD,bpd

I will try and explain my side and what my mother does (with proof) but she won’t acknowledge that or listen. I’ve actually cried after appointments because I’m being berated and verbally abused for stuff that isn’t true.

But now I think he’s sick and tired of seeing me. And it alternates I never know what mood he’s in. One second he wants to marry me and have babies and the next moment he’s mocking me for something or getting angry with me for having emotions. Every single day is an emotional roller coaster. He keeps telling me I should leave him. 
The other day he told me I am only with him because I have low self esteem. But then goes out of his way to take care of me and be a complete gentleman. 
People with BPD what is going on here? Is he flipping his perspective on me depending on the black and white thought process? I don’t want to leave him because I understand all relationships take an insane amount of work and dedication and I love him deeply. But it’s almost like he is not giving me that choice.

I’m fucking pissed. I’ve been on edge lately and this is triggering me. I feel like I’m going to split and do something really bad.

Guess what? 15 minutes go by, 15 minutes of my damn appointment that was only 20 minutes. Why the hell would I wait my entire goddamn appointment to not even HAVE an appointment. Only 5 minutes of an appointment. Not only that, but the lady at the front desk was having a fucking attitude, telling me that “it’s not your appointment, it’s the doctor’s appointment. She will have to come” or something like that and “we have emergency patients here” hello??? This is not the ER what are you talking about??

Into the vast emptiness I throw all my self-hatred, as I am just a mere mortal who does their best to get through life. I must not hold on to the pain of the past, but instead find a way to have it exist, but no longer have it as a weight crushing me. 

I feel like a coward and know damn well that my self medicating is only making my situation worse. A moment of feeling like i can function ( let’s be real i am not as functional as i trick myself into thinking) but I just cant find it in me to just stop. I have no purpose. 

Nothing that really gives me reason to want to get out of my bed. Don’t get me wrong as i love my cats and family, but when it comes to life purpose or insensitive of any kind 
—- i have not. I used to be so passionate, and maybe it was my ex (who managed to break me) or maybe i am the one to blame for still even allowing such an irrelevant   still be a cause for any grievance or shit that may happen in my life. I don’t love him. I have long since wanted to be with him, and still he remains in my life like a ghost. An ever haunting presence that  keeps me angry and resentful. 

Fills me with a rage that has me wanting to burn all that he holds close to him. I know that even giving him the time of day in thought has me already as the cringe loser. I know, but I cant stop myself. I want him to hurt bad. Just. As bad, and i cant. I need to stop. I am feeding myself poison, and it’s getting too outrageous.

Oh to stop,, or doomed to flop. 
And my goodnesss. This fatigue. And on top im too damn broke, so I have not gotten new contacts. Actually have not seen a doc in years. 

Oof. Biggest oof. Y’all don’t be this way. Take care of them eyes. Do as i say, and not as i do. 

Shhhhhh. 
FUUUUUUCK:/
I am so tired, and I know that it won’t change until I do something different. I’ll Spartan kick the fear of failing and allow myself to have a podcast with some audio imperfection or my voice a bit off, as I’ll at least have a podcast I can feel pride in. 

As I stand, bordering the edge, of this vast emptiness I come to the realization that I no longer fear falling and it is that which truly terrifies me. 

I have no idea what I’m trying to say. I am just so fucking tired all the time. It does not matter what I do and it feels at times that no matter how hard I try nothing seems to ever fucking work. I feel alone, and I have become so socially inept it is actually a bit ridiculous. 

I have tried, what feels like, everything and that includes but is not limited to BPT, group therapy, medication (anti-sad pills, anti-flying over the cuckoo nest pills, anti-anxi meddles, etc.), meditation, journaling, running, working out in general (ran a 5k and go to the gym 5 days a week), hobbies (knitting, painting, pottery, photography, coding

I wish I had a friend, but I am scared that I have lost the ability to even begin to allow someone in. I hate that there is a part of me that wishes someone would swoop in and just see how hard I try and maybe even extend a hand. Just so that I may feel like I still exist. I still am seen, and not just the ghost I feel I am at the moment.

I resent not being able to not ruminate and every day I wake up with hope, but it lasts very little, and the rest of the day is just a never-ending fight and I am just so fucking tired. Fuck!

1mpcdrs,Abandonment hysteria and break ups,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently going through the very early stages of a break up and spinning out, I can't even find online a good explanation to my behaviour so thought I'd come to the group to see if anyone else has shared this experience (throwaway as identifying info on main account). 30F for info.

This is my second long term relationship that's ended (this time mostly due to my insecurities and emotional dysregulation) and I seem to follow a pattern.

For a few hours I feel quite numb and just doing daily activities a bit sad, then I feel a wave of hysteria and desperation feeling pushed away or abandoned. It feels like I lose all control, I'll be vomiting, sobbing and calling him absolutely desperate to speak, desperate for him to take me back - really embarassing myself begging him and pleading with him. No matter how hard I'm trying to reason with myself during this time I'm absolutely hysterical and can't think about anything except this intense need for him to want me again. It feels so manipulative and awful. This feeling seems to fade when I get some sort of assurance that there's still love or care there and then I go back to numb until this feeling inevitably spikes again.

I see lots of people talk about resisting the urge to call or distracting themselves, but it's so beyond that point it's like full blown hysteria. I don't experience this with friendships ending or other transitions in life it's just being left by a romantic partner.

I'm only a couple of days into the breakup and I'm desperate to find a way out of this spiral. It's absolutely debilitating and humiliating, but most importantly not his responsibility to give me any reassurance and I feel absolutely awful for the pressure it must be putting on him.

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I feel insane, like I've lost my mind

I've tried grounding, mindfulness, breathing exercises, journaling, writing notes as though they would be sent to him - I'm due to start therapy but I still have a few weeks and I'm so scared. I'm really trying so hard to give him space but this overwhelm rushes over me and it's like I'm in some sort of fight/flight mode and I'm fighting for survival - that's the only description for the panic and adrenaline and deathly fear I can think of

Ive done plenty of research into it, im writing an essay to help furthur my research and im curious if i could still get diagnosed if i present majority of the symptoms (I refuse to self diagnose and i understand theres a chance i may not have it) and im looking for opinions

For reference too i also have C-PTSD so it may be part of that.",1755148393.0,2,4,BPD,bpd

Everyday I wake up hating myself for what I did to him. He truly was the best thing that ever happened to me. He was the one guy who never hurt me. He never talked bad about me. He was always there. He was reliable. Handsome. 

He was everything I ever wanted...

And what did I do?

I mocked him, belittled him, I used his deepest secrets and insecurities against him.

And I did it with a SMILE on my face during my episode.

Now my apartment feels empty, my work life is killing me, and what do I have to come home to afterwards?

Nothing except another bill.

Why did I convince myself I didn't love him? Why did I treat him like crap when I thought he was too good for me? Why couldn't I have just let him down gently like a normal person?

i've brought this up to her but we didn't really have a conversation about it. i don't know how to ask for reassurance from her without sounding like a crazy person. i dont want her to think that i want to consume all of her time. i feel guilty for being so needy and wanting to talk to her all of the time. 

its currently 10 pm and I'm crying cause she didn't want to call tonite. every time she doesn't want to get on the phone, i start having thoughts about her losing interest in me, her being upset at me, or her having better things to do than talk to me. when she doesn't want to talk, i subconsciously start giving her the cold shoulder and become emotionally detached, which leads to extreme extreme guilt and the feeling that im not meant for a relationship. im in so much pain and i feel like im going crazy i just cant even bring it up to her without getting overly emotional. sorry if this is too long lol.",1755147131.0,2,0,BPD,bpd
1mpr09w,Moving with my boyfriend ruined our relationship.,"My partner 26M and I 24F with BPD and ADHD lived together for nearly a year after dating for only 3 months. For context it was circumstantial and he moved into my place 3 months after we met due to his rent situation. We then moved out together when we probably weren't ready but we had already been living together so we thought it would be fine.

My partner and I have decided to live apart after fighting non stop since moving in with each other. This is really hard on both of us but more for me as he made the decision. We really love each other and don't want to breakup so this is our way of fixing things. We think that the space apart to date each other properly will help our relationship since we jumped into it so quickly and both became complacent.

He says that this is the last thing he can do to try and fix our relationship.He's also said how he loves me and he doesn't want to end things. He's told me I need to go back to therapy and stay in therapy for life; which I agree with and I have booked an appointment to find a new therapist after mine pretty much ghosted me. He himself had to go to therapy and is organising couples therapy for us. Everything feels like its my fault and I can see how drained he is from being with so much that he's decided to move out. He's also mentioned how he feels that I've lost my independence and he's lost himself. And he wants to have the time living apart so we can love each other again and actually go through the dating phase.

I am seeking any advice on how to get through living alone after living together with such bad abandonment issues because I am already a mess and trying my hardest not to ruin things when I know he is trying and rediscovering my independence and the things that make us love each other.

I just really need advice on how to get through this.

TL;DR; : My partner and I (24F & 26M) lived together after dating 3 months, but constant fighting led to a decision to live apart. We still love each other and want to stay together, seeking advice on adjusting to living alone and reconnecting to build our relationship back up.",1755146934.0,2,1,BPD,bpd

Ive noticed that most of the times using philosophy helps me overcome my triggers by completely eliminating expectations from life(including my partner) and simply not needing anything thats out of my control, so theres no chance that i get disappointed. But sometimes i wonder what the line is between giving up my ego and giving up self respect. I want to express what i want from my partner, but i fear that i only want it because it boosts my ego (like reassurance, wanting to feel important to them and needed). How can i know if im letting them love me just the way they feel safe in or if im letting myself accept only a little effort? I wouldnt ask for anything if i knew that they were putting in a lot of effort for me, but i have no way to tell because they dont love the way i do, and asking if theyre putting in effort seems rude.",1755155221.0,0,0,BPD,bpd

I cannot stop crushing and getting attached to, like, everyone. (males, since I am a straight woman…) People I see on the street. Especially this one guy, saw him on a walk FIVE years ago. Still remember everything. Still think of him. He looked at me once. That was enough for me to marry him in my head and feel like my heart was about to give out whenever he crossed my mind! And this happens every time I leave the house. Every time I have an interaction with somebody. Every time I see someone on Instagram. I see things that remind me of them, when I know almost nothing about them. I will make up scenarios in my head, I will dream about them. Writing this out makes me realise how pathetic this seems…!

Yes, I basically have no hobbies and I somehow still manage to link my interests with my endless amount of crushes. It’s genuinely driving me insane. I’m so desperate it makes me feel sick. I’ve never been in a healthy relationship, no surprise there, so I cling to EVERYONE in some sort of sick hope they’ll love me back. I just want SOMEONE to be mine, someone who I can pour my heart into.

I found this guy on Instagram that happened to be friends with one of my friends. Of course, I was absolutely over the moon. Stalked his page, we have the same interests and he’s cute! It must be fate. (I say for the 578th time in my life.) Told my friend about it and she agreed to tell him to follow me. Next thing you know, he’s blocked me. This has sent me down a spiral today!

This time last year I was in the worst possible spot I've ever been, I was disconnected from those I cared about-- and I suffered because of it, I felt abandoned, left behind by everyone I had cared about throughout highschool, and fuck me Uni sucked, but now? I'm fine, fuck that better than fine I'm doing really damn well for myself. But I'm still afraid--

Recently I went through a breakup, and throughout the whole relationship I was doing my normal shenanigans, overthinking, panicking, attatching myself to my partner, who I'll call E. E was-- amazing to me, and the only reason we broke up because SHE was having mental problems (she has her own past trauma-- I wasn't mad or anything about it, if anything I was afraid for her.) But normally a breakup would devestate me, send me spiralling and back to how I used to be-- even last year when a lesser relationship ended I genuinely lost my shit, I fell to new lows that I never thought I would. But this time? I was fine, sad of course, even devestated, I lost someone I thought I had genuine chances with, she was a friend and I truly did love her, but once it ended I didn't lose everything... And I can't figure out why.

My Psychologist said that I exhibited really borderline traits in a relationship, but this time something seemed different, at least with the relationship, when I didn't, I think it was because of how we broke up, and E explaining that it was entirely a her thing, but even then, it makes me think that maybe I am healing, but I really don't seem to vibe too much with that idea. Since-- to me-- It also thinks I may have been wrong with treating my mental, similar to what my pysch said, as being 'borderline'.

I dunno, I'm conflicted on myself and my psych said that it's still a possibility as a diagnosis, but im healing and I don't want to be that guy who faked a disorder, I mean I didn't but like-- I dunno I'm even overthinking this right now.

I feel hatred and resentment that I have to pay for everything in our relationship and how hard working is for someone with BPD and a child, while he gets to just stay at his house and do nothing.I CRINGE hardcore at myself and him all the time. we don't live together but I get so stuck on the fact that I buy him so much stuff and take him on trips (my love language), take him to concerts (we have one today and a few more this month and I regret it so much because I genuinely prefer to go alone right now but its too late to do that) --- yet he's never even bought me a $1 drink, it affects me so much so that my brain goes numb.

1mpjhvg,romantic relationships are exhausting,"im on my third relationship right now and although it's the healthiest and best/most compatible one, i'm still struggling. when my partner doesnt respond quickly enough or seem interested enough in what im saying, i instantly withdraw and start splitting and i have to fight it off every single time and control my actions and attempt to rewire my thought process and fight off the thoughts of ""they're gonna leave me, they don't really love me, they've lost interest, etc). it's like my brain is constantly finding problems or evidence that my partner doesn't really love me or is going to leave me eventually, even though i dont ACTUALLY have any REAL evidence to support it. my partner also struggles with mental illness so we both just kinda go back and forth between supporting the other but it's really hard for me. it's so much effort to support me and them at the same time, and it's worth it but sometimes i just want to give up because of the internal stress and worrying. i'm not going to give up, i would never, they're too important to me, but still. it's so fucking hard and i just want my pain and struggle to end, i'm tired of it. 

i've always been like this in relationships, it literally does not even matter who it's with, it's wonderful for a few months and then everything spirals because i start to have trouble controlling my emotions. i don't even know if there's an exact point in time in relationships where i get like this and start becoming triggered, but it always happens without fail. i have locked in and gotten better at controlling my actions though, which is good because i used to REALLY not control my actions. fighting this shit off completely by myself tho is so isolating because my partner can't understand what i'm going through and i just feel completely fucking alone. i feel weak, and dumb, and just like a horrible partner because i struggle with this so badly. i'm actively in therapy and working on figuring stuff out with my therapist and i'm searching for DBT tactics in efforts to help, but there's only so much i can do at one time and it's fucking exhausting.

  
i just wish i could go back to when we first got together and we were happy, now it just feels like a battle every day to just act like a normal couple (at least from my end). i love my partner very much and i'll never ever give up on them for any reason, but i just wanted to vent about my struggles because i kind of don't have anybody rn lol. if you read this far thanks",1755125855.0,3,0,BPD,bpd
1mpmagg,Trying to find the “roots” of triggers,"My therapist has been encouraging me to find the “core wounds” /roots/wtv. behind my BPD symptoms. But I just can’t think of anything that feels quite right or fully justifies why I’m like this. Even though I would say I have a pretty good memory from three years old and onwards, it just feels like something is missing. 

Because of that, I know that my BPD symptoms started developing around 8 years old. But WHY. You can argue “BPD can be genetic too!” But I just know that something was wrong, probably multiple somethings. And there’s some things you could argue, but I feel like I’ve never had any particularly strong feelings about them. They don’t really feel connected to my disorder either. (Had experiences in teen years and later, but I already 100% had BPD before then)

Maybe I’m just lacking perspective of my childhood vs what a healthy one should be? Maybe there is stuff I don’t remember?? If anyone has any advice or similar experiences, lemme know",1755133092.0,2,1,BPD,bpd

1mpqrzx,Fear and poly,"So. In the past I was polyamorous with two partners. Neither of which is my FP.......well a lot has changed. I lost a partner and gained two. One of which is said FP. Things have been amazing. Absolutely wonderful. They are understanding. Our mental illnesses work well together. 
This isn't to brag. I am aware though that I am lucky.

Thing is I'm worried my fears have done a large part of this.....I....... constantly fear being alone, being abandoned. How.....can...I be abandoned with three lovers? 
I worry constantly that I've built this......in order to feel better. 

I do.......feel better right now and it's horrifying. I haven't split in months......when does it drop and I break once more?
I know it's when, not if. And when it happens will I destroy these three? 
How many will be left?
Have I made it worse. Instead of fear of abandonment now, I fear hurting those I love. 
I'm also afraid I can't have friends. I recently rekindled a friendship with someone who I broke before.......but what if I break again............. What if, she never comes back. This is my third chance to have a wonderful person in my life. I. I'm scared horribly that I'll ruin EVERYTHING.

1mpqg72,Therapist-in-training with BPD — feeling alone and discouraged living with a stigmatizing,"Hi everyone,

I’m in grad school to become a therapist (just finished my first year), and I was diagnosed with BPD 10 years ago. I still struggle with many of the common symptoms deeply — and while I’ve done a lot of work, the pain is still so real. I’ve been feeling especially triggered lately by a housemate I live with.

He’s also a therapist, and he often speaks loudly and casually about how people with BPD are “crazy” or “flawed” in a joking tone, but it still feels so hurtful. I haven’t told him (or many people at all) about my diagnosis because of this kind of stigma. But it still hurts. I feel so unseen and judged in my own home. Also when he talks about it, he seems to have a pretty good understanding of how it shows up and what it looks like, and I'm scared he can tell I have it as others have called it out before. (Side note: I'm actually really unsure of the BPD label and think something like CPTSD would be much more healing and trauma informed for ppl struggling with these symptoms.) 

Recently he asked me a strange question that felt like he was implying I’m hard to live with, and it’s been eating away at me. I already struggle with feeling unlikable and broken, and this situation is making it worse. I can’t afford to move out right now, so I feel trapped.

I guess I just needed to say this to people who *might* understand. If you’ve ever felt like you had to hide your diagnosis — especially in a field that’s supposed to be compassionate — or if you’ve ever lived with someone who makes you feel like you don’t belong… how did you cope?

1mplkgs,My Friends Left Me and I Feel Like My Life Is Ruined,"I’m a senior in high school and struggle with severe anxiety, depression, and BPD. Last year, going to school was so hard that I would cry and sometimes even vomit. I felt completely alone, and my friends didn’t really understand me. I started therapy around that time, and for the first time, I began self-harming because I felt so isolated.

Fast forward to the first week of senior year: it’s happening again, but worse. Over the summer, one of my friends left our group, saying it was “toxic” (P). I didn’t see it that way—arguments were mostly misunderstandings. They blocked me but stayed in touch with my close friend, V, which made me feel abandoned.

On the first day of school, tensions came to a head. My friend, V,  in our group chat about not knowing what to do, as hanging out with me and everyone else made P angry, but they didn’t know how to split their time between to friend groups. I apologized and acknowledged that it must be painful to be stuck between two friend groups, but I also expressed that I felt hurt, because I felt that it was irresponsible that P was angry with V for hanging out with me even though they were the ones that left the group originally and didn’t talk it through. After that, V and my best friend M started ignoring me. When I tried calmly asking what I did wrong so I could fix it, they refused to respond, and eventually they blocked me.

Now I feel completely alone. I can’t eat, I cry constantly, I’ve been skipping school, and I feel like my life is falling apart. I haven’t self-harmed in a long time, but the urge is creeping back. I cried for hours until my brother had to come and give me and anxiety pill just so I could calm down. (I choked on it lol) I know I’m not entirely innocent, but I feel like I have nobody to turn to. Even talking to my girlfriend is hard because she gets overwhelmed. I’ve been vomiting and crying and I just feel like my life is ruined.

Also, my girlfriend and P been close friends since they were younger, which makes everything even harder for me to process. I’ve reached out to my friends through platforms where I haven’t been blocked to apologize, but I still haven’t received a response.

I finally want to say that I’ve never used an app like this before—I’m just feeling really helpless and sad right now. I don’t have anyone I can talk to anymore, so I’ll take any support or advice I can get.",1755131140.0,2,2,BPD,bpd
1mou8mv,I have BPD and get irritated when my bf falls asleep before me,"So I have BPD and this is kind of weird but I’ve noticed I get so upset when my boyfriend falls asleep before me and I feel awful because of it. We both have very different sleep schedules, he goes to sleep relatively early and I can often stay up all night without getting tired. Something about him falling asleep triggers me to feel betrayed and abandoned and sometimes I get irritated or passive aggressive with him because of it. Or i’ll frantically try to do anything to keep him awake if I notice he’s getting sleepy. I feel so awful because I want him to be healthy and get good sleep but I can’t seem to stop myself from getting angry over this and I really want to stop. We don’t live together so it’s also especially triggering when he falls asleep when we hang out because i feel like he’s wasting away our hangout time by sleeping. I love him and care about his health. I don’t want to control his sleep schedule and deprive him of sleep or make him feel bad for getting sleep that he needs. The anger I feel over this seems almost natural and uncontrollable even though I know it’s wrong.

1mpkpnu,Trouble regulating emotions at work due to management.,How do most people manage the emotional toll of working a corporate job?

1mppcex,I don’t have any friends (never really have),"Since I was a little kid I’ve always had trouble making friends. I was outgoing, then introverted, then eventually outgoing again. But despite people saying that I’m kind, enthusiastic, ‘always smiling’, helpful, and other things like that; I have no friends. People seem to like me, but never enough to want to be my friend. I have one ‘friend’ (I still call her a friend) but I don’t know why..

I’ve known her since I was seven and even since I was that young I was always her ‘friend of convenience’. She would tell me often that she was bored and that’s when she would reach out. Whenever she said she was busy, it was because she was always hanging out with other people.. Again, even as we were CHILDREN; not teens or anything. She would go out places and do all this fun stuff with everyone else but whenever it came to me we just stayed at her house and played games and whatnot.. She seemed to preserve anything interesting for everyone else.

Don’t get me wrong, I have many fond memories with her. But she’s always been very selfish and never really opened up to me about anything more than surface level opinions and interests despite how long we’ve known each other and how many hours and days we spent with each other at a time.. I was her friend outside of school but never in it. I was always excluded when invited to her birthday parties that it felt pointless to go.. I’m very open about my opinions, interests, and things going on in my life. Despite this, she would never get things I was interested in for my birthdays or important life events. I LOVE gift giving and I put a lot of heart and thought into the things I get for everyone in my life, even if I don’t like them. It’s simply a passion of mine but I understand that not everyone is good at gift giving or has the interest.

HOWEVER, I have countless digital lists on many different types of stores, apps, and in many price ranges. Not only this but I would expect more of her considering how much of an ‘open book’ I am. For example: she would get me perfume; I have sensitive skin and simply don’t wear perfume (I don’t like the strong scents and it makes my skin red and itchy), she would buy me LOTS of candy; much of it I cannot eat because I’m allergic to an acidic ingredient in American made chocolates and don’t really eat candy in general because it makes me feel sick, she bought me makeup when I was a pre-teen; I had zero interest in makeup then and didn’t even own any to begin with because of said lack of interest.

Hell, I had texted her for holidays; Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and no response back. She knows my birthday but doesn’t even send a text; even when I posted it to my Snap story in hopes to ‘remind her’ and despite her having viewed it; nothing. But when I sent HER a happy birthday message, I got a reply in minutes.

This has been bothering me for a long, LONG time. I don’t even really talk to her anymore. She’s just kind of there. At this point I’m just watching her live her life from a distance.

I’ve also only ever dated two people and I’m 20 now.. Again; likable but not enough to be friends with, let alone date. It makes me feel alone and unlovable, even as a friend.",1755141690.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mpker5,What is the difference between love and FP?,"So obviously I know the two intersect, my boyfriend of a year broke up with me about 5 days ago. I have been really sad about it don’t get me wrong, I have cried my eyes out and cry a little now. You see my therapist told me she suspects I have BPD 3 days ago, and I think it tracks (going to a psychiatrist next week to start the process of officially getting diagnosed). And looking back a lot of our fights where me having BPD episodes, my ex always felt like he had to walk on eggshells, it sucks things ended this way because we where so happy and meshed so well, but I ultimately respect his decision.

When it first happened I felt like I was dying, a piece of me was taken away, and I just wanted to end it all, I wanted to call him and hold him almost every second. And after he stopped sharing his location with me idk something snapped. I’m still sad, but I have come to the realization he’s not coming back. He was my love, we shared so many good times, and ultimately he was my favorite person. After realizing he was my favorite person, idk it made the grieving a bit easier. Can someone explain to me what is happening because it’s kinda freaking me out. I am so confused, why am I so numb to it all, am I just in shock?

1mppb7l,Are anyone else's episodes physically taxing?,"For context, by ""episodes"" I mean prolonged periods of time (weeks/months) in which symptoms are more intense, or at least that's how I apply the term to myself. 

Recently I split on someone I'm involved with (basically friends with benefits/casual romantic relationship within a polycule). The situation is a bit complicated, won't get into it here. But I'm essentially quarantining myself away from them while trying to figure out how to express my need for space before things really implode. I keep rapid switching back and forth between barely restrained disgust and hopefulness that somehow things can work and stay as they have always been. I feel like I'm ripping a nerve out. It's reached seeing shadow people levels of stressful. That's where the mental exhaustion comes from. 

But it's also been physically painful. My back is almost always tight, but for the past couple weeks it's been fucking wretched. Just yesterday I took 800 mg of ibuprofen to get through work. In general my normal day to day pain has been worse, like I've been wearing my knee wraps more frequently. My throat is tight just from typing all this out and thinking about it. My heart rate has been picking up out of nowhere, although granted that might be the amount of caffeine I've been consuming in an attempt to fend off the fatigue and boost my mood. Yes, I know that's probably not helping the mild hallucinations, I'm going to bring it up with my therapist to explore better ways of coping. I've also been feeling really fatigued. On my days off I've just stayed in bed because I just couldn't bring myself to do much else. My sleep and appetite are fucked too.

Mocking his job and salary? I was unemployed

Saying he didn't have responsibilites and he didn't know what it was like to struggle? He was a military veteran.

Talking about how he would never understand what I was going through? He had been through trauma I couldn't imagine.

Suggesting he was stalling on getting an apartment? He was secretly funding a college fund, a ring fund, AND he was expected to pay for the 'dream wedding' I thought I wanted. So he was stretching every dollar as far as he could.

I told him 'We both know where this relationship is heading.' But the truth is I knew I was going to dump him but he was completely blindsided by it.

Then I mocked his eduacation, but he had a bachelors degree and I was a drop out

Its just, now that I'm in treatment and my therapist calls out my BS when he sees it. Part of it is he said I felt the need to tear him down due to low self esteem and a negative self image. Or that I purposefully said all that stuff to him because I didn't want to break up with him and was hoping he would.

As he said 

""You do have trauma, and it has caused you to have the mindset of a teenager who doesn't understand how much she hurts people with her words because she hasn't had time to grow up and learn what life has to offer.'

And its true....My ex was slightly older than me, and he was giving it his all.....and I spit on him for that.

She suffers from BPD and while yes it has impacted us, we have been quite happy. What I am looking for is how to better manage those more rare arguments where things get more heated. She can get irrational at times but I know her feelings are valid. Are there any resources, online workshops, workbooks or the like that I could use to better understand her mindset so we can get through the rough patches more effectively? I want her to know that even when shes irrational that it's valid and shes still deeply cared for, but it can of course be a challenge when i'm also upset.

I hate her thinking shes a burden cause she really isnt and brings me so much joy. Sometimes I can be hyperbolic when we get into fights and will say things like ""you always do x!"" when in reality she may have done that thing once or twice and it bugged me at the time. She will take what I say and think about what i said all the time. I want to help her break that.

Quit a job that was causing me grief and heartache, found a new promising job. Found a man that absolutely adore me, he would shift the world to make me happy, and I would do the same for him. 

He even, reawoke the hopeless romantic inside me that's been dead from years of shoving my symptoms down so that I could cope. Instead of an independent female, nearing femcel, with a 'fuck you basic man I can replace you in a heartbeat, you can't replace me attitude"" I'm clingy again, he's my FP, it's terrifying again. 

It's a cycle I'm fearful of as I move in with him. I'm afraid of being *that* person again, afraid of splitting, we are still very much in a goofy phase, no big arguments yet. 

I practice mindfulness, and stoicism, and all the other fun things that avoid therapy. Ive never been good talking with people about my problems, because I've been the mediator for my family's problems. Somewhere along the way vulnerability= weak to me.

But only when it's me. When he's vulnerable I wanna wrap him up and soother him and comfort him, I promised I'd never hurt him.

1mpf8zf,split on my best friend. ruined everything,"hi guys! as the title says, I split on my best friend and ruined everything. permanently. two nights ago, i unfriended him everywhere and told him we’d no longer be talking and that he wouldn’t be able to reach out to me. this happened because he hadn’t replied to me in about 3 days despite being active and spending time with another mutual friend of ours. so i got extremely angry and very impulsively removed him off of everything. the day after i added him back and apologized for my irrational behavior, but at that point our relationship had been effected too much. i told him we couldn’t continue to be friends because i feel horrible for subjecting him to my split and that he would eventually resent me, and he understood and agreed to not be friends moving forward. but I feel so so guilty and appalled at myself for this. we’ve been friends for years and we have been through so much together, i genuinely got tunnel vision and so angry in the moment that I couldn’t even remember everything we’ve done together. i have been a wreck since then I can’t stop crying and I know I have zero right to feel guilty. I just wish my brain wasn’t like this and I wish I wasn’t such a horrible friend to the people I love most. i want to make things right and be friends with him again but im afraid ive already burned the bridge too much, and again im afraid that even if we *do* rekindle our friendship, it’s something he’d eventually deeply resent me for over the years and unfriend me then. And I don’t just wanna sit around in fear waiting for that inevitability to happen. besides his family is going to hate me too. I just need advice on what to do going forward please ",1755115967.0,4,4,BPD,bpd
1mpidhr,I’ve become myself wholly and still nobody wants me,"I got diagnosed with BPD at 21, that was five years ago. I no longer meet the criteria technically (only have like 3 of the symptoms, even though those 3 still rage with force and often rule my life). One of the criteria that I’ve totally surmounted is the one of identity instability. I used to have no idea who I was, like struggled to even simply describe myself, but by this point, I know exactly who I am, I do what I want (with respect :P), and I do it all with confidence. People who met me more recently would never believe I was the insecure, socially anxious person I was several years ago. 



I know what I stand for, I know what I like, and I have passions and hobbies I dedicate most of my free time to. I feel like I have a very solid identity now. I’m still chronically suicidal, and have severe mood swings and urges to self harm, but I’ve spent a lot of time nurturing and growing into myself. When I want to die or hurt myself now, it’s not because I hate myself or think I deserve it, it’s merely as a remedy for pain relief. But I truly do love and respect myself now. It’s just that I’m so often alone, and I find being alone so painful. 



I’ve been single for three years, haven’t gotten laid in nearly two, which people are often surprised to hear. By all accounts I’m a very attractive woman, I’m smart, I’m funny, but nobody is legitimately interested in connecting with or committing to me. I’m sure lots of folks would like to hit, but be done at that, and I’m not interested in anything casual. I’ve confessed feelings for several people in this 3-year period, and every single one led to a full rejection. I mean obviously I have flaws like everyone does and also the not-so-small mental illness baggage, and nobody is everyone’s type, but I think I’m a good person and I know how to treat others with respect, and dating has just been so damn difficult and made me realize just how different I am than other people.



I think I’m just too much for many people. Most people don’t feel everything so profoundly, like many of us do, and while there’s nothing inherently wrong with that, I think it means I’m going to be alone for a long time, possibly more than I can bear. It breaks my heart in two to hear about weddings or engagements or to see couples show affection for one another. And of course I pretend like it doesn’t bother me, but it really does sting every single time. And every time I’ve been rejected, the other person has said something like “don’t worry, it’ll be so easy for you to find someone.” And I hate when they say that, because it’s not true, and I feel like I’ve tried so hard to learn about myself and put myself out there, to just be alone all the time. I’m so tired, and with everything materially getting worse, I don’t know how long I can hold out like this.",1755123179.0,2,4,BPD,bpd
1mpeckd,How to avoid the “zone”,"Sorry for my English!

My anger goes from 0 to a 100 in seconds, and everything is so blurry afterwards, and cannot think back properly to how we got there, and whatever I remember always makes me question why I got so angry. When I am in the “zone”, I scream and shout and cry and want to physically hurt myself when the other person won’t understand me or acknowledge what they did. Whoever experienced me like that said that I was saying that same thing over and over again, but to me it feels like I was trying to get my point across no matter what and the other person just doesn’t seem to understand, or acknowledge they wrong doing or say what I wanna hear, so I am repeating it again and again. And after an episode, I feel so physically unwell, lime I am shaking on the inside and my stomach is sick.
It only happens with my family and one ex. My family is the that if they know something bothers me, instead of not doing it, they do it behind my back and lie, but I always find it out, and get into the zone trying to explain to them how it feels that I asked such a simple thing and they lied - and they always say that they didn’t tell be because of this reaction.
I couldn’t take my cat with you when i moved out, because he is older, and didn’t tolerate the new place at all, so my mom takes care of him now. He is chunky, and I put him on a diet, and I buy his food, and I told my mum how much she should feed him for him to lose weight for his health, and theres’s always more missing, and she never knows where they went. And she lies a lot and never has the backbone to own up to what she did, so that makes me even angrier. And I told her not to feed him something because it’s not good for cats, and I found that thing a few weeks later in his bowl, and I confronted her, and she started to cry and she usually threatens to hurt herself, and then she gets angry and says bad thing a about me, and then she says that I should shut up, because I am repeating the same thing over and over again, which I am and cannot stop until I make her realize how it feels, and it’s not such a great deal avoiding that food, and she won’t understand that if she hadn’t given it to him, I wouldn’t be mad, or if she’d just owned up to her doing it instead of becoming the victim. Nobody can tell her she did something wrong cause she starts crying and swearing us for being horrible.
And the rest of my family is the same, and I feel like hirting myself, because I cannot trust them, I cannot trust that if I ask them to respect something, they will. I know they promise it and swear not to do it to my eyes, but they will do it behind my back.
Please help me how I could deal with this.

1mpe6mf,Weed & BPD,"Hi, I just wanted to see everyone’s opinion on smoking weed & having BPD. I was a chronic user for years but I haven’t smoked in about 2 years. This was due to my mental health hitting a very low point, what I assume was an episode of psychosis. I don’t know what it was, I just was a danger to myself & others. My partner blames it on weed, I think it’s due to my BPD. In all the years that I have smoked, this has never been the case until this specific time period. Anyways, I quit. Now my mental health is so much better & my bpd symptoms are minimal (the best they’ve ever been) i don’t necessarily believe it’s because I quit, rather better life circumstances. I do wish I could smoke again, with strict rules for myself on how often & when but my partner disagrees with me. I just wanted to hear everyone else’s opinions! ",1755113584.0,1,20,BPD,bpd
1mpblu0,Feeling guilty about having such a good partner - anyone else relate?,"He buys me flowers every month, shows up to all my events and tells me how beautiful/wonderful I am. He brags to his friends about how I am the coolest girl ever and that he can't wait to put a ring on my finger. My family loves him, my friends think he's a great guy. Even when he found out that I can't have kids, he said he would rather be with me than leave. I know that I am really lucky. 

Yet I can't help but feel like he can do better than me. 

I have been sex repulsed for the past few months. Part of that was due to a bad experience we had, and then it was all exacerbated by a medical issue I'm still trying to resolve. His love language is physical touch, yet I barely want to kiss him. He says he feels undesired and it affects his feelings of closeness and self esteem. I get it, but I can't get out of this funk. 

On top of that, I have a hard time with my emotions. (As I'm sure we all do). I tend to withdraw when im not doing well instead of leaning on him for support, which is what he has communicated he'd rather have me do. I just find it hard to talk about my feelings. He hates feeling shut out from me. 

I'm in therapy and I think I'm doing better managing my BPD. There's always progress to be made, of course. It just seems that every few months he and I will have a discussion about what's wrong in the relationship and it's nearly always me. I am not satisfying him physically, I am withdrawn, and he feels like he's putting more effort into the relationship. I think he is, too. I am too busy trying to keep myself on track! I wonder if being in a relationship just isn't the healthiest idea for me at this time.

1mpgo9f,I can’t get over my ex,"I have only ever been in two relationships. I’m currently 20 and diagnosed with BPD (obviously). The first lasted just shy of two years but I knew her for more than that. The second relationship lasted less than a year; a terrible man with a matching mother and he ended up SAing me and that was the last straw. My first relationship though is what I’m here to talk about. This woman was the most intelligent, kind, beautiful, talented, and most soft spoken person I’ve ever met. Neither of us ever even considered I had some kind of emotional disorder or personality disorder at the time. But despite this, she was always kind and patient. She was a very mindful person; someone who would tell me to take a step back and look at the situation again. Someone who would call me when I was having panic attacks or episodes to talk me through it. Truly the kindness person I’ve ever met and nobody had ever made me feel so loved. We didn’t argue in our relationship (as she firmly wanted to talk things over always) and saw each other on a specific day and time of the week because we knew both of us still had our own lives.

When we were together we were nearing the end of high school. She was (and still is) living with a very racist, homophobic, transphobic grandmother who had guardianship over her. One of my ex’s “FRIENDS” (HEAVY air quotes here) told her grandmother directly that she ‘suspected’ we were together. Her grandmother who used to say how much of a good influence I was and how much of ‘a joy’ I was to have over, suddenly didn’t think so anymore. She wouldn’t allow my ex and I to speak as much as we used to or meet up anywhere for actual ‘dates’ (unbeknownst to her). One day, while I was at work by myself on a closing shift, my ex sent me a long text. It was over. She said how much she was sorry and said that it was because of her grandmother’s actions, making her feel hopeless. We spoke and saw each other for a little longer but then I was suddenly blocked on every platform, including my phone number itself.

It’s been three years. I waited two before I even thought of dating again and clearly that didn’t work out. She’s walked into my work a couple of times and we’ve seen each other from a distance and locked eyes in a few stores; almost like it’s destined to be…

Every few months or so (after the first year of being ‘blocked’), I have been sending messages. I waited a year to do so in hopes that I would have moved on or just suspecting I would forever be blocked. I had gotten a couple of responses in one day after I had seen her in a store whilst shopping with my brother. After three years (it was earlier this year) she finally responded and briefly caught me up on the bullet points of her life. She suggested we meet up to catch up properly and I happily told her that I work all days of the week besides ‘X’ day and ‘X’ day (I’m full time).

She never responded to that. But, as before, I’ve periodically sent her messages and haven’t been blocked nor responded to at all. Lately though, I’ve been growing desperate because I NEED closure OR an honest answer here of some kind.

You’re not bothered enough to block me but don’t want to respond either.. Knowing her though, I feel, genuinely, that she is probably nervous to engage in case history repeats itself. I don’t blame her for that.

I just miss her so very consistently and for so long now. I still think about her constantly and wish I can hold her in my arms again. Even if just for a while. What do I do? Why can’t I get over her? What should I say?

I feel like, while rejection would hurt, I would rather that then spending ANOTHER three years pondering and guessing. I need to know. I feel like I haven’t been able to live without her because she was literally all I had ever wanted and it doesn’t help that the reason for our parting was because of something out of (at the time) our control. If we ended on a bad note or something, I know I wouldn’t be as hurt or even think about her.",1755119202.0,2,2,BPD,bpd

My questions are these: how do I best support her? What kinds of things did everyone’s parents or family do that helped, or was there anything you wish they would have done but didn’t? It seems like self-awareness has been a difficult thing for her to develop. I see so many posts here with people with incredible awareness of themselves, how their mind works, and how they can help themselves. How did you develop that? How can I encourage a 12 year old to do that? How can manage these massive feelings and stresses she feels? 6th grade was a nightmare, for her and us. We have an IEP, and are trying some meds, but no one, her included, wants 7th grade to be another very bad year. How do you all manage this?

1mpgn3t,Long-time girlfriend begging me to get therapy. Will it help?,"Some quick context. Pretty much as soon as I turned 15 I’ve had BPD symptoms. No therapist or psychiatrist took me seriously because I was so young, and told me I’d grow out of it. One even said I was “too nice” to have BPD. Well, now I’m 28 and I still have the exact same symptoms I did as a kid. 

I’ve improved over the years just because of the sheer amount of both romantic and platonic relationships I’ve fucked up, but there are still times I lose control and there’s nothing I can do about it. I have a girlfriend of 3 years who I love more than anything. She’s extremely supportive and sweet, and I want to keep her around as long as I can. She is my favorite person. 

The thing that sucks, though, is I just love how it feels to fight. It gives me a rush like nothing else. I like feeling jealous and angry and taking it out on her. I can usually control it, but every so often I’ll split on her and it’ll lead to long, petty fights. No amount of DBT practices can help in the moment when I feel like that. 

The worst part is, we’re in a long distance relationship right now. And it makes me feel absolutely out of mind insane sometimes. I didn’t realize how hard it would be to maintain. I’ve tried journaling, distracting myself, DBT techniques; they all *help*, but nothing truly gets rid of it. After this last fight, my girlfriend begged me to get therapy or else she’d break up with me. 

I’m wary of going to therapy again, especially for something as stigmatized as BPD. So, what are your experiences with DBT? Did it help at all? Is there anything a therapist can give me that a DBT workbook can’t?

now, i wonder if that is not because i spent five years single. once i started seeing (now dating someone again), it was near constant emotional turmoil. when they ended things at one point - not due to any stressful behaviour on my end, they just were not sure they could balance a relationship and work (they had not dated in many, MANY years and had zero interest in it before i came along - i almost admitted myself into the psych hospital because i was sure i was going to probably kill myself (i wouldn't let myself attempt, my cat needs someone). then again, i had just moved to a new content and had several other awful things happening, but that felt like the thing that pushed me over the edge. 

we are dating well and i have received nothing but compliments on how healthy and kind and gentle of a communicator i am. even during the ""break up,"" i was emotional, but always kind, gentle, and non-toxic or manipulative. however, this took a lot of work, and i was suffering internally. 

i need weekly reassurance and am prone to overreacting and it ruining my whole day if i don't get it. before, i would have lashed out; now, i simply put myself in what i've dubbed ""sensitive baby jail"" and wait until i am SURE i can communicate my feelings in a healthy manner. my biggest bouts of impulsivity are binge eating. 

i want to be clear i haven't really had therapy, i've just done a lot of mental work on my own. 


it's just hard to tell what's really being recovered enough to ""no longer meet criteria"" and what might be a change to ""quiet bpd."" asking in general as well, i know y'all can't see into my brain. i just know it feels like i have put a choke collar around my own neck, but i hold the leash, and choke myself out until i am sure i can ""behave.""

I've only worked service jobs (barista, a few different retail positions, dispensary, cafe, and now i'm a barista again). 
Although my current job is relatively easy and low pressure and pays decently i am still finding myself burning out and struggling to show up to work every day (which is difficult at this job as i am the only barista) i have only been here 2 and a half months but im already wanting to find something different.
my reasonings mostly surround my mental health. I'm struggling a lot with working alone and having to deal with customers face to face alone as at previous jobs i've been able to hand difficult customer interactions off to a coworker or manager. 

I also am just feeling exhausted every day my shifts are 6:00am-3:00pm monday through thursday and 6:00am-10:am on fridays. this schedule i thought would be ideal but i have been finding it nearly impossible to get through a full week without at least leaving early one day. this also has to do with the fact that i tend to get sick when i am tired, exhausted, and stressed.

there is also the fact that nobody at my job is aware of my mental health issues and so there is not an understanding there and i am uncomfortable disclosing because i only have male superiors and i am deeply uncomfortable with talking about things like that with men. I also am not sure if there even are any ways to realistically accommodate me here. 

the reason im posting today is i'm just at the end of my rope. i just moved into an apartment and need income as i pay rent but i am struggling to continue this as my quality of life is going into the gutter.

1mpcfco,Relationship Trigger Advice?,"CW: Suicide, self harm

Haven't posted in a while. I'm now 26F (BPD) engaged to 26F.

Has anyone had any luck reducing severity of responses to relationship based triggers without disconnecting emotionally from their partner?

Historically that is my tried and true solution, I just disconnect from them and it stops affecting me. But this causes all sorts of issues I'm trying to avoid.

My thoughts were some form of self help ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention), but my responses are pretty severe (SI/SA/SH) so it seems impossible. The black and white thinking seems to be my hang up, all I can seem to do is disconnect or feel everything.

I'm looking for some starting point for self help sort of ""homework"" practice immediately until I can tackle things deeper in therapy. Any personal suggestions?

1mp8je3,I'm Going Through a TIME,"Been on and off with a guy for a few months, and then last weekend I ended up making last minute plans to go out with him and crash at his place afterwards. That's not really a thing I ever do but I was already out with friends who didn't want to go clubbing but for once in my life I did, so I went. Anyway, we had a great time, slept together, and then I went home the next day. In person he was funny and kind and caring, and then as soon as I left he's been ignoring me. Don't get me wrong, I haven't bombarded him with messages (I've sent him two since Sunday) and normally I would give him the benefit of the doubt that he's not been on his phone or whatever, but he's been consistently viewing my posts and posting things himself since then, so clearly this isn't just a case of him being offline. I just, I don't understand because we had such a good time, but I guess he's not interested. Normally I would be fine with that - I could at least get over it - if he'd just come out and told me, but I feel like I'm suspended in limbo waiting for him to respond. And obviously the bpd means that I've really taken this to heart - I think he was verging on fp despite my best efforts - so I just feel angry or sad all the time which is so annoying.  I can't decide if it's worth it to sendIt's difficult because I know that this isn't a nice thing to do from him, but I also know that my reaction is disproportionate. Like, I should not be suicidal over a boy not texting me back. Anyway, it's my birthday, which he knows, and he's still not messaged, which just makes everything worse. I'm wondering if it's worth sending him one more message asking him to clear things up, because at least then I would get a straight answer, but I also don't want to send ANOTHER message when he's clearly not answering them for a reason. It's affecting my mood at home and I've been asked several times what's wrong but I can't explain this to anyone. I just feel like ripping all my hair out over it and then I hate that I feel that strongly about it. I just don't understand what happened between Saturday night and Sunday afternoon, you know?

I really like him and he has primarily green flags!

Because we talked about a possible relationship, i asked if he had had a thing with any of his friends (probably a bad idea lol) and he said yes and explained the situation (they were friends before, sort of had a thing, it didn’t work + she lives further away and it was also a poly situation which he didn’t like). they still talk frequently because she is in the friend group and he says neither of them would try to date or anything again. i want to be chill and believe him but im having so much anxiety about it and im not sure if i can keep seeing him. 

the other part that’s concerning me is that she has some similar features/qualities to me- qualities that he has specifically complimented me one (ex: i love how dark your hair and eyes are).  he also said she’s really fun and has said the same to me. i feel like the specific compliments are really getting to me head. i don’t just want to be her replacement because it didn’t pan out with her. any thoughts are appreciated!

1mpg6yj,"[CW: dismissive medical professionals, really heavy stigmatization, and mention of hospitalization] I'm seeking diagnosis for BPD and my psychiatrist refuses to even screen me","So, to keep it brief, I (18M) have really bad emotional issues and a really bad fear of abandonment that severely impact my relationships and, to a lesser extent, my actions.

For the longest time, I thought I was just broken or crazy, however in recent months I've done extensive research and found that my experiences are indicative of Borderline (or at least something adjacent to that).

Back in June I ended up in a psych ward and, upon discharge, they had me set up with a new psychiatrist and therapist. The first time I met with my psychiatrist, I asked her how I would go about getting checked for BPD and she told me something along the lines of ""I don't like diagnosing that cause it's a serious condition"" (red flag number one but I shrugged it off and figured I'd just ask her to refer me to someone else the next time I saw her)

So today I saw her again and this time she went on this huge rant about how ""Borderline is the worst mental condition someone can have"" and how virtually all people with it are criminals, addicts, or at the very least just bad people who refuse treatment.

Now obviously this is a wild overexaggeration and horrible thing for anyone (but especially a health professional) to say, but then she additionally went on to basically tell me that she ""doesn't see that"" with me because I don't have any criminal or drug abuse history, and that I just have ""mild emotional dysregulation""

Mind you this woman has interacted with me for a net total of about an hour.

This is very frustrating to me, especially as someone who has a long history of basically begging medical professionals to take me seriously and then still not getting treatment for years (I wasn't diagnosed with Autism and MDD until I was 15 and I wasn't diagnosed with Fibromyalgia until I was 17 despite bringing up all these issues to countless people over the years, and just being dismissed constantly).

Even if it's not Borderline and it's something else, I'd still like to at least be taken seriously enough to be screened for it. Because ""mild emotional dysregulation"" doesn't wreck your life and relationships the way that whatever's going on with me has. And if it's not BPD, then I wanna know what it *is* so I can at least seek support for that thing.

Idk sorry if this was pointless or something, I'm just frustrated.

**Also, important note:** I am seeing about switching to a different psychiatrist, so there's a possibility this will be resolved in the near-ish future, I'm just very frustrated right now",1755118097.0,0,0,BPD,bpd

1mp01cx,I’m actually starting to feel like myself again 💕,"
Hey guys, 
I hope everyone’s doing alright!

So, I didn’t really know who to talk to about this so I thought I’d share it here. So I was in a really rough part of my life not too long ago, for quite a long time but I’m starting to feel like myself again. I almost lost myself and every relationship I had, was almost hospitalised and life just seemed to be against me.

I started lamictal about a week ago and it has been the best thing that could have ever happened to me. I’ve tried so many different medications, do therapy regularly and tried everything to stop having bpd take over my life and nothing seemed to work. As soon as I started lamictal I instantly felt calmer and like I could think a bit clearer. 

It’s only been two weeks and I’m still upping my dose like I’ve been told too but I honestly just feel like a different person, it’s like suddenly all the good qualities that people with bpd have are outshining the bad and as you all know they can be quite terrible and debilitating. I’m not saying I’m magically fixed and I know there’s still so much work to do but I’m actually ready to heal myself, not for everyone else but for myself.

I guess I just wanted to share this and hopefully remind all you beautiful people that there is hope. I’ve been there, where things just somehow seem to keep getting worse but there is hope. I hope you guys don’t forget that and I’m here if anyone needs wants to talk or vent 💕

1moyoj9,My abuser died & I feel responsible...,"I (28 F) have responded requently in this sub, but have never actually posted about a situation that has affected me, and still bothers me to this day.

I feel guilty for something I KNOW I shouldn't, I know it wasn't my fault but most nights I lay there and wonder what I could have done differently to maybe change the outcome.

For context, I was sexually abused by a cousin of mine when I was a child, I was lead to believe it was a game and never questioned it until I grew up, this is where I believe my BPD stemmed from, and I struggled a lot with my emotions all these years & the guilt around what happened to me when it wasn't even my fault. I felt dirty and I couldn't trust anyone, thinking all I was good for  and the only way to get attention and love, was to sleep with people. This was obviously a really bad time in my life.

When I was diagnosed, I finally came to terms with the situation and realised, with the help of my therapist, that there was no fault of mine & I was in fact abused. This sort of unravelled my life & it took a lot to really get past it, but the nightmares sorta stopped.

Fast forward to last year when this cousin reached out to me, he wanted to know if he'd made it all up in his mind as a fucked up person, or if he had in fact abused me as a kid - I confirmed what happened and we talked about how he had BPD too, how he was also abused as a child. He wanted to meet up and talk in person so we could reconcile and he could make it up to me somehow. I ghosted him.

A few weeks later, I was told by my mum that she received a call that he had hung himself. I was distraught, even if it had nothing to do with me, I can't help but feel guilty because of the timing. He tried to reconcile and I ghosted him, I never truly gave him forgiveness and it must have been killing him inside, his fiance who knew everything, told me at his funeral that he loved me so much and he was so upset and sorry about what he did to me that he had wanted to make everything better in whatever way he could, and honestly it felt like an accusation on me, as if I should shoulder the guilt for not forgiving him and not giving him a reason to keep on living.

Since then I've been a big advocate and try to help as many people I can who are struggling, especially when suicide is referenced, but I still can't help feeling like I failed.

It shouldn't be my fault, I know that, deep down I know that I was a victim and this wasn't on me at all, that I should say he deserved it, that justice was dealt etc. But that just isn't me? How do I get past this? It's been over a year since his passing and I'm still so fucked up over it. I just want to mourn a family member, without feeling guilty for his passing, but also without hating him for what he did. I just want to move on & forget what defined me for so long.",1755073182.0,7,3,BPD,bpd

In reality, you’re either chasing them or getting ghosted or trying to hold onto straws to not let go of the fantasy.
This time the same happened again
Got a new FP -> started dreaming -> checking up on them even though they never reciprocated -> made excuses for them -> just kept adding to the fantasy for weeks

I got a bit of liquid courage, took a deep breath and took control of this -> first time in my life.
I wrote to them * I have some feelings for you and I want to assure that you didn’t do anything to lead me on. These are MY feelings and I’m glad I have it for you. I’d rather say this to you than regret not saying it to you*
I also told them that *if I crossed any boundaries unintentionally I apologise with no excuses*

Left it at that.
That’s it.
I am not going to check what they reply as I’m just happy I told them. If they say no I’ll be free from the limerance, yes I’ll lose them but I won’t have any regrets as I actually worded out my feelings than ruminate in a fantasy.
I have a vulnerability high right now but I have started seeing BPD as more good than evil.
Atleast I am able to have feelings (A LOT at times) instead of being an avoidant. 
BPD is already tiring and I’m just making things easier by just being honest with everyone instead of staying in my head and living.

I wakeup everyday and just lay there for hours, hating the fact im alive. I know I need to see someone but I've spent the better part of this morning trying to find MH supports that are taking new patients.

Is it common that neurodivergence and BPD overlap? I’m really new to this diagnosis so not sure if that’s a thing.

She also thinks that I’ve developed coping skills that have helped make my BPD appear mild but she thinks it’s moderate to severe. I have been going to therapy literally since high school so that could also make sense.

I didn’t have a great childhood. BPD makes sense. But idk how to feel. She said it was a highly stigmatized disorder and I do agree. I just wish it was as easy as getting diagnosed for something medical, like a definitive test result or something.

1mpd61y,My beloved little brother,"I am a 36 y/o old sister with two younger brothers, one of which (28 y/o) has BPD c/w NPD. This evening we had a really deep and meaningful heart to heart about his ex, his relationship with our parents and our father dying at a very young age. There is no convincing him that his birth was the start of my fathers drug and alcohol abuse -- linked to his fear of abandonment wounds. 

What I've tended to notice about him, and fed back, is that he appears to live a pretty healthy and happy existence when he is NOT in a RELATIONSHIP. In fact, this is the basis and foundation of most of his triggers, episodes and the beginning of most of what we call, a ""crisis"". No matter how angelic and wonderful his partners seem to be, treading on eggshells and tiptoeing around his paranoid delusions and hypervigilance, they can do no right and he can do no wrong. When he splits and ends the relationships, it can take months and months for him to recover, to the point of our family members having to nurse him back to a place of wellbeing. There are -- and has been -- nothing wrong with his exes. The last one (we all thought) was too good to be true. 

The other thing I've noticed, is the more attractive, successful, happy and perfect these women are, the more likely he is to have absolutely nothing to do with them ever again. He fell in love with his last girlfriend, but couldn't manage the normalcy (without being triggered) for more than 3 months. 

He ended things with her in June and talks about her every single day, weaving her into conversations where she has no place being. At dinner on Sunday he spent hours at the table stalking her social media. He is so obsessed with her, but at the same time cannot make room for her return. As an older sister, I feel helpless and unsure of how to support him through this journey. He hasn't started DBT yet, but I worry, that by the time he does, this woman of his dreams may be long gone.

We’ve become part of each other’s daily lives and always make time for each other, even when we’re drained from talking to others. I got to know about her BPD a bit late in the friendship. 

We’ve had a few disputes, mostly due to miscommunication and my tendency to avoid bringing up problems. She’s usually the one who pushes me to talk so we can resolve things. I’m trying to change that.

The main issue now is that if I say something that unintentionally upsets her, she sometimes shuts herself off—like deactivating her account—for a while. She admits she’s not sure exactly what triggers her, so she doesn’t want me walking on eggshells. But in those moments, I tend to leave her alone instead of reaching out elsewhere, because I’m terrified of saying something worse. Hurting her repeatedly is the last thing I want, but leaving her alone often makes her feed herself more negative thoughts, which only upsets her more.

She’s told me, “It’s easy for most things to blow over if the person says the right thing,” but I’m never sure what that right thing is. I want to stop upsetting her and prevent her from shutting herself off again. Other than improving my communication skills, what else can I do to prevent this from happening again. I just want to be the better best friend to her.

But rather than show him how much I cared and show him how special he was, I insulted him, I put him down, I hurt him so bad. And I found out from our friends that he blamed himself for the end of the relationship.

I didn't want him to miss me, but not only did he miss me, he was hurting because he couldn't understand what he did wrong.

Our friends have been doing a good job at holding me accountable. But the thing that has been tough has been....accepting I handled it all wrong.

In my mind, I was completely justified in my behavior because I was doing what was best for both of us. And my friends are like ""NO, you were being abusive out of paranoia and low self esteem.'

It took a LONG time to realize 'Oh crap, they're right! I was being abusive!'

Is this a result of the BPD? Why did I not realize it sooner?

And the worst part was I still wanted my ex in my life, he is a GENUINELY great guy, I was hoping to be at his wedding one day seeing him marry someone more stable. But now I haven't been able to spend time with him and...I miss him a lot. 

I never realized how much I used him for emotional support, and he did so much to me, and at the end, I couldn't even be there for him when he needed me. ",1755038323.0,32,9,BPD,bpd

1mp4lls,I've been a bad partner,"About 8 months ago, my boyfriend (24m)really really hurt me(25f). We've been together 5 years this October. He didn't do anything physically, but to spare details he was looking at stuff in his phone......... the ""stuff"" was a friend of mine..... innocent on their end.....
I have been unable to forgive him, or even allow myself to try, because he never really gave me a good answer. His answers are because he is stupid, he made a mistake, and it was ""curiosity, do you not understand that""  well I was the one who decided to stay. We've talked and both of us have agreed that I can't stay in the relationship yet continue to hold the grudge on him... it is only hurting us....
I've always hated my body and my face and really reeeeally struggle just existing.... so when this happened my entire world has fallen apart. I don't know who I am, who he is, what I want to be, what I want to do. All I can wonder is why? Why did I deserve that? And I'm angry. I'm so angry anymore. Along with BPD, I have autism, and a lot of the times my meltdowns are because I'm confused in the conversation/wording was off to me and I can't think through it, food is a big trigger, or when I am just feeling a bad mood come on, I'm really bad at verbally voicing my pains/problems. I can text it but nobody in long term relationships likes to have important conversations thru text.... I get it..... 

The thing is last night he told me he doesn't believe I love him anymore. He said ""I don't think, i know""
I think this hurts worse than being cheated on. I love him so much.... I'm hurt yea, but I don't want him to leave me.... I don't want to be alone. I don't know how to help myself forgive him so we can move on and be happy again. I feel so disappointed in myself.

Occasionally, I get this big burst of just overwhelming happiness. I'll get so happy I could cry, sometimes I even do. I'm not even sure why; everything is just great. It feels like stuff is on track, and I can take on the world.   
I start feeling creative, and want to decorate my journal or do all sorts of stuff. There are so many things I want to do and plan, cook and bake, see and visit. Like I have to catch up on all the things I wanted to do the weeks prior, but was too depressed to actually do (wish these bursts of energy would include the want/need to clean my house, but alas 🤣).

Unfortunately, it never lasts long, and there's always this gnawing at me (and everyone else around me walking on eggshells), wondering when I will crash and burn this time.

I wish I could feel this happy and full of energy and life forever. Just good vibes all around. I'm bringing it up in therapy tomorrow, but can anyone relate to what I'm talking about?

I’m nearly 19, and everything inside me is changing faster than I can keep up—but ironically, my productivity has flatlined. With growing up, I feel more disconnected from myself than ever, as if life is slipping right through my fingers.

I grew up mostly alone—both my parents work long hours, and emotional support has always felt distant. I suspect I have an anxious attachment style. My boyfriend started university this year, and now I feel lost without him. My mind is consumed by fear: what if he leaves? If he replies slowly, hangs out with friends, immerses himself in lab work—I collapse into emptiness and worthlessness. Once anxiety takes hold, no amount of reassurance can pull me out.

It feels like I'm addicted to love. His life moves forward, vibrant and full—but I feel frozen, insecure, and hopeless. The thought of living without him terrifies me. If his feelings changed—if he pulled away—my sense of self might just vanish.

At home, there’s no warmth. My parents barely interact, and care seems like a foreign concept. It’s as if the world outside me is crumbling. I’m becoming someone I don’t even recognize—reacting intensely to delayed texts or social media updates, crying, overwhelmed by this hollow, aching void inside.

I feel meaningless. I hate that I feel this way—I hate that I can't stop feeling this way. I'm utterly exhausted, emotionally and mentally. Family life feels emotionally cold—everyone runs after their own rhythm. I feel forgotten, uncared for. My dreams feel like distant ghosts. I was once a hopeful dreamer, but now—hope feels extinct.

So. I feel like this diagnosis has ruined me.

At first, I felt elated too. I finally had an explanation for some of my feelings and troubles, even though some important things didn't quite fit. At the time, I would never describe myself as unstable or overly emotional. I felt like I was in full control of myself, just justifiably unhappy with how my life turned out, and I felt like it had little to do with instability or emptiness. And by that time I had consistently won over my anorexia, so there's that. I had power. And just to paint a clearer picture: when my mom was dying of cancer, I only cried twice: when I first learned of the diagnosis and when they came for her body. To paraphrase: my armor was impenetrable, and it protected the core full of passion and substance.

But when I started to dig deeper into the research, I kinda began associating with seemingly foreign qualities I would never apply to myself. It's like my empathy got bugged and switched the focus on what I read on the internet about BPD. My unraveling was a slow process. Here and there, I came upon things I found relatable. I started doubting myself, my image, my personality. My emotions gradually became all over the place. I began crying a lot. Self-harming with reckless abandon. Destroying my body in spite of how hard I tried to make it beautiful. And I started making poor decisions I would NEVER make before. The control was gone. I became clingy and sensitive; before, I used to pride myself on being the cool independent girl. Before the diagnosis, my life was like a puzzle that missed a few pieces. But after I got it and began my research, I started actively dismantling this puzzle, piece by piece. Now I feel like everything I knew and cared about is just a trauma response. Ambitions, hopes, creativity - everything I was, everything I wanted to be, became inconsequential. Why bother? This was a mask anyway. Through discovering my diagnosis, I have learned to notice the emptiness inside. Or maybe invited it and let it stay.

Its always myself in the form of self harm (if it gets to that point) usually its just me crying. People react badly 99percent of the time.

So i googled it and i found out how some people litterally believe that crying is manipulation?

I never want anything from people when i cry. All im doing, well, actually im not doing anything i literally cant help the biological reaction that happens when my emotions get too intense.

All im doing is shedding tears. Even when im litterally silent. Ive tested this out. If im a loud cry or a silent cry it makes no difference people dont like it and tell me to stop.

I dont know what im supposed to do in a world where my natural emotions are not accepted

1mo3gkh,My gf has bpd and I just need some help,I love my gf but I think she's become very controlling with a lot of things. I try to make her happy by respecting her boundaries and standards even if in my opinion they seem a bit unfair. I really enjoy watching movies with her but she has a strict rule of no nudity of any kind I always make sure to find movies she likes and to skip nude scenes. We haven't been able to watch things I've been excited about like Gen V or comedy movies. She finds it cheating to like characters that are female whether they have sex appeal or not. This extends to video game characters as well. If I pick a female character to play she will get mad at me and split. One night she split on me for playing Wattson in apex legends. I feel like a prisoner and it's making me really sad. I try to talk about it with her but she doesn't understand what I'm saying at all and just thinks it's normal to have these boundaries because some of her friends have it too. What are some ways I can express myself without seeming like a jerk and inconsiderate to her feelings on these topics? ,1754988698.0,82,46,BPD,bpd
1moz4ft,yelled at someone i care about,"what the title says. i was feeling like complete shit because i have been sober for an entire week because i get irritable and hostile when im under the influence, so i figured i would get sober and hopefully avoid passing my own misery onto anyone close to me. turns out when i am in a clear state of mind i just get mad a lot more articulately and say even worse shit. 

so this girl who im friends with came to talk to me because she was also feeling sad and i ended up lashing out and saying some really awful stuff to her. she is usually pretty non-confrontational but usually at least tries to talk back, but this time she kind of just rolled over and took it. seeing that made me feel rlly guilty and i shut up and apologized before i could say anything relationship-ending, but i still feel like an awful person for making such a sweet person feel like that. 

im leaving a lot of stuff out because im kind of just screaming into the void and dont really know where im going with this but yeah. god i hate having bpd and i hate being trans. oh yeah this girl i yelled at is also trans so now i feel like double shit. idk. remember to be nice u guys",1755074923.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1moke6p,Just been diagnosed,"I got diagnosed today. It's completely thrown me. I thought I had a pretty good level of self-awareness and attribute most of my mental health issues to anxiety and depression. I've been in therapy pretty consistently for about ten years, I have friends with BPD and know a fair amount about it, but really wasn't expecting the diagnosis for myself. It definitely tracks and I do have a lot of the symptoms, but trying to wrap my head around this is making me spiral so much right now. 

How could I have been living with this and have had no idea? Do I actually have zero self-awareness, or is this just loss of identity I'm experiencing right now? Was I actually the reason all my relationships ended, or was I genuinely with people who weren't good for me? Did I end friendships for the right reasons or was I actually in the wrong? I suppose now I'm questioning all my thoughts and wondering if they're actually my thoughts or just BPD symptoms. I already felt lost but this is a whole new level. I already felt like I had no purpose and now I'm wondering if I ever will. 

Looking for advice on how others came to terms with their diagnosis, especially if it came as a surprise. Can you live a happy, fulfilling life with BPD, or is it a constant battle of trying to differentiate thoughts vs symptoms?

1moqqw5,majorly fucked up i think i split on my boyfriend who’s now my ex i think,"i fucked up bad. my bf of 2 years and i had issues with him like being messy and not working. but the good far outweighs that. he is the most gentle, sweet, swag, patient, understanding and funny person ive ever met. he was my best friend and we saw a future together and really were in love. we talked about our issues it a lot and he was making an effort. things were normal after we talked but one day last week, my brain started consuming me with only the negatives and i was seeing in black and white. we went from texting all day to me being cold and mean and then i broke up with him. over the phone. like it was on call but still how could i fucking do that i was so cold and mean and he’s so sweet. i completely went about it the wrong way. i should’ve sat down and really discussed everything, even if it ended in a breakup. but i don’t think it was worth breaking up over and i now realize thag. these things feel so trivial too like i made such a big deal when hes the best person ive ever met. i feel horrible. in the past ive been cold and ghosted people but they were losers and it was never with a real serious relationship. i didn’t realize how much pain ive caused to others until i caused pain to the person i love the most. im finally facing the consequences of my actions. 

i don’t want it to end, so i texted asking if we could like actually talk in person and i would apologize but he’s so hurt and i don’t think he wants to see me. and that is so valid. i didn’t even realize how much he loved me. like yes he told me all the time and showed me it but i don’t know how to accept love and for some reason would doubt it      i don’t want to be like this. i don’t want to hurt such pure people. i miss him. i fucked ip so badly.

1moynzh,vent,"hello all. i need to vent and for someone to tell me whether im overreacting or not. sorry in advance for the long post and for any grammatical errors, english is not my first language.

i have a best friend, lets call her M. me and M have been friends for a couple of years now and i can confidently say that besides my girlfriend shes the closest person to me. she has also been my FP for a long while (maybe still is, but im not sure). i love her very dearly and trust her with my life and i know that she considers me her best friend as well. 

however theres one thing that makes me upset. i know it may seem insignificant, but please dont laugh or judge me, i already feel awful for being upset because of this. 

its the fact that M almost never takes pictures with me, and when she does she never posts them anywhere. she has two instagram accounts, one public and one private, and she always posts pictures with all her other friends on both of the accounts. theres almost 40 posts on her private account, all pictures of her and her other friends, meanwhile im in like two or three. 

im gonna be honest - it makes me sad and jealous. i know that this might seem silly and like a stupid reason to be sad, but when i see her sharing a million photos and memories with her other friends and almost none with me, i just cant help but be upset. it triggers my bpd a lot. it makes me feel like shes ashamed to show people that im her friend. i just cant help but ask myself why its so natural for her to take so many pictures with others but not with me.

maybe it makes me so upset because i myself always post pictures with M everywhere on my social media. i like to ""show off"" the people im close with, i want other people to know that im proud of the fact that theyre in my life. i guess id just like to be shown off too once in a while. just to feel like someones proud to have me in their life too. 

someone please tell me whether all this is a valid reason to feel sad or whether im overreacting, because im lowkey losing my mind.",1755073118.0,1,2,BPD,bpd
1moyetl,how can i stop taking jokes to heart so much,"something that i realise dislike about myself is that i take jokes so seriously, or twist them in my head to a point i take it personally. i’m sure the fact i’m autistic and take things literally comes into play, i just hate how much of a party pooper i can be. it’s literally any form of teasing, i interpret it as disrespect and as them finding me the low of the low or stupid and uninteresting or them disliking me. sometimes i’m able to brush it off on the outside but a lot of the time i end up visibly upset and go quiet and have to leave whoever and wherever i’m hanging out with for some time, even if they then specify it’s a joke. it’s so fucking stupid and it causes so many problems like the people around me (friends, family, partner) feeling like they’re walking on eggshells and just in general the feel goes dull because of my sensitivity and reaction. 

what are some instantaneous skills i can apply to avoid visibly getting upset and needing time out at people teasing me? what can i work at in my head to not take everything as an attack/personally? i hate being unfunny and making others feel like we can’t joke around together, it’s upsetting and embarrassing at this point ",1755072128.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1moyab2,I’m ruining my relationship and I don’t know how to be better,"For context, I live in the UK and have been increasingly more scared about the direction the country is going, as I’m of the belief we’re walking right into authoritarianism. 

Yesterday I had a paranoid episode because of the Online Safety Act, and how I don’t want our social media use connected to our IDs. Full blown panic attack. 

Me and my partner tend to not talk politics, as he tries to be optimistic that the country wouldn’t go full fascist, and things will get better, whereas I don’t have any of that hope. 

It resulted in a massive argument, and I then ended on a half-split (I was fighting one) and spiralling about our relationship. That we’re not compatible, that we’ll continue to fight about this stuff, because I will always be paranoid about it and need reassurance. Idk how to be better. 

It then lead to a conversation that I’m holding myself back staying with him, because
I feel lost in life, scared of everything, wanting to do things but not knowing how because I feel like this country is not safe, but also because if I move too far we won’t be able to stay together (due to our circumstances and me not wanting to live with a partner). 

I’m 26, and have nothing to show for it. I don’t have a house/flat, stuck in the same rental doing the same shit, and rather than doing what I want to do, I just get stuck spiralling with intrusive and paranoia. 

I can’t stop the spirals and the intrusive thoughts, and it’s impacting my relationship badly. I don’t want to leave him, I can’t picture my life without him, but it’s all just a mess in my head and I’m so tired.

In the last 3 weeks I quit my job, built a billion dollar startup plan, blew $6K on nonsense and got engaged all in 3 weeks. Manic episodes are undefeated.

Now I’ve kind of come down and crashing, reality has struck me. I’ve been doing so much coke and drinking everyday to cope. 

There’s this constant battle which has amplified lately with me wanting to truly heal and get better and building stability in my life and also burning myself and the world to ashes.

I guess I am just writing to share my current situation because I feel stuck. My doctor says I need to socialise myself more and honestly I can’t do that unless I’m abusing some sort of narcotics or substance. So this is me attempting to reach out and connect with others.

If anyone here has tips or advice, I’d appreciate it a lot because I feel so lost. I want to get my life together but I also really don’t care if I rot away in my sleep and the only people I feel care enough to offer help are the clinicians I pay to be there lol.

1mokv0s,Working with kids is helping me heal,"I was officially diagnosed with bpd three years ago, though I had an unofficial diagnosis through my therapist for the past 7 years. I’ve always struggled with it. ever since I was child, it’s been difficult for me. I never understood why other people don’t react the way i react, don’t feel the way i feel. I didn’t understand why i couldn’t control myself in certain ways, and i didn’t understand why I was always being punished or scolded. Last year, i felt the worse I ever have. My ex had just committed suicide, my only friends abandoned me a week later, and my boyfriend at the time dumped me a week after that. I had never felt so alone and triggered. I had no one. But a couple months after that, on a whim, I applied for a job teaching acting to young children at my local theater. I’d never thought I was good with kids, infact I thought they all hated me. But I got the job, and I went in anyways. and oh my god, I had never felt such pure joy. One of my biggest struggles in my bpd is chasing an unattainable feeling. That persistent loneliness was always there, and I kept chasing people and things that I thought would make that loneliness go away. Never in my life did I expect to feel it in that cluttered theater attic surrounded by 4 year olds. The way they looked up to me, the way they laughed so purely. These kids were the first people who’d made me truly laugh and smile in years. My position ended a couple weeks ago, with the end of summer coming. i’m applying to more childcare jobs now, and have some good interviews lined up. I just wanted to share a good moment, something i’m proud of. ",1755032443.0,7,1,BPD,bpd
1moxif4,advice for starting college,"i’m starting college tomorrow. it’s been 11 years since i was last in school. i’ve done a lot of work on myself this past year, so much so that i’m strong enough to go to college!

i’m confident in my ability to control and regulate myself and my emotions, but i’m definitely not an expert or anywhere near where i want to be. 

what i’m worried about with school is regulating in the moment. i can regulate, but it takes time depending on the situation. a lot of big events are going to happen in school that are going to be triggering and overwhelming, and i’m not always going to have the time to step away to regulate. 

what do you do when you’re in a triggering, stressful situation and your body feels like it’s going to explode if you don’t let your emotions explode, but you’re unable to step away?

A gut feeling since June has told me something like this was going to happen, and right now its beginning to fully unravel. I guess I'm here because i feel like I'm losing a part of myself, i don't know how to exist, breathe, enjoy life, without him. Knowing someone is there always has brought me a comfort I haven't had in a long time. I have no idea what to do, and if it does happen how do i even handle myself. I currently have no form to get help/medication. I usually smoke weed to relieve the stress but where i moved its illegal. I cant drink either since all that does is cause me anxiety. I have no friends where i live currently, and i absolutely don't have online friends i can be myself with. My partner, has been the only person, i could be myself to. I have tried so many different ways to form genuine happiness but everything so much better with my partner. I am genuinely am an extremely lonely person and all I've wanted in life was to love someone unconditionally. I thought we were forever but i don't think he feels that way anymore. The funniest part, is that I'm not mad at him, at all, for feeling this way. I just hate myself more than ever, because i know i fucked a good thing up and i don't know HOW I'm going to recover from this. My past ex called me his abuser, told me everything i did to him. I did everything i could to be better and i definitely have become better, not perfect, because change comes with time. i thought that i was doing okay with my partner but right now it feels like I'm hopeless.

1motnhy,The girl who saved me tried to end her life.,"TW: SH/SI

I met a girl here on this sub and we entered the same discord chat. We’ve been dating for almost a year now and when we met I was so low and hopeless. We started off friends and she was so strong and supportive through my spirals. We had both had attempts in the past and mine was never planned- more like “I’m going to go so wild and see what happens” hers was different. We both knew what we were getting into and she had overcome her depression so much that she showed me how to overcome mine. I was getting more stable in ways but more unstable in others (as I do with relationships). We started off long distance for the first couple months but then we ended up traveling back and forth with each other to one another’s countries. Our last trip was back here to America from Brazil and we had planned to stay until her visa was up and then get married and start the process for a dual citizenship. During this stretch a lot of stress built up with money and life and plans. And a huge mistake we made was not getting enough of her antidepressants from Brazil. She was running low and hadn’t told me she started skipping doses. This along with the stress led to a psychotic episode that’s led her to think immigration was after us and the only way to stop it was to end her life. She tried- a friend (also from this sub) and I saved her and she’s been hospitalized ever since. (Almost a month ago). She taught me how to love, how to be happy in my skin, how to let go of the little things, how to trust. Without her teaching me all that I could have never been resilient enough to stay alive through this time. It’s been so hard seeing the one who saved me- almost not save herself. With the BPD this is a lot to handle but I’m hoping we get through it. I’m scared, but we are both still here. Any support is welcome. ",1755055477.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mot5og,is it time to breakup?,"hi everyone, i've (23F) been with my boyfriend (25M) for a year and a half now. it's the longest serious relationship that i've ever been in. it's also the healthiest and most stable one i've been in. we all know when it comes to BPD that we are not used to stability. i'm really having a hard time with it recently and im trying to be compassionate to myself, but man i don't know anymore. 

i've been feeling like i just want to be alone and not in a relationship at all for weeks. actually, ive felt like that on and off for months now, but recently it's been on my mind daily. my boyfriend hasn't done anything wrong, he's great. it's just me :/ 

i feel like i want complete autonomy. i wanna do what i wanna do, when i wanna do it. i wanna hangout with whoever i want. i wanna do literally anything without worrying about someone else's feelings, but i wonder if this is me self sabotaging. i'm not used to stability and it might just be me looking for excitement.

i feel as though ive already made up my mind and am in denial, but i don't know if it's just my BPD? it just keeps ping ponging back and forth in my mind. i can't tell if the sadness i'm feeling with losing him is genuine or just me feeling guilty about hurting him? 

i already had a talk with him after speaking to my therapist just so he knows where im at mentally. i didnt tell him im considering ending our relationship, but he figured that anyway because he said he was scared it'll be too much for me eventually.

1mos07k,Issues with feeling anger without feeling ashamed/guilty?,"Hi all! I’m new to the community. I wanted to ask my fellow in remission BPD folks if they struggle with a similar issue as to what I’m facing.

I was recently told that I’m in remission and I’ve been sooo excited and feeling like I have a new lease on life. I feel like I am starting to understand who I am and care deeply about myself for the first time in my life. Despite being in recovery, I am still learning coping mechanisms and tools every day to make my internal processes a bit smoother for myself. One thing I really struggle with is guilt for being angry.

I learned how to cope with my anger issues very early on into my recovery, but I did that portion alone, and I think I’m really struggling with how I taught myself to internalize it. Any time I feel anger, I feel such an overwhelming amount of guilt if I express it. I feel like I’ve learned to invalidate my own emotions by trying to apply logic. 

For example, I still deal with anger towards my breakup from like nine months ago. I feel the rage spike, and I’m automatically trying to apply logic. I make sure that what I’m feeling isn’t blown out of proportion and is valid before anything else. Then, I apply the logic and facts of the situation and include empathy for him in it, but the issue is the empathy and care for him still runs so deep, I start to feel guilt and shame for being angry. I don’t know how to honor my feelings of anger anymore. I am able to suppress them easily doing this, but I’m not letting myself feel it. I’ve struggled with this for years, and it makes the people around me confused when I try to approach conflict and immediately back pedal because the guilt is just eating me alive.

Does anyone have any tips on how to start to process anger in a healthier way than this? I want to honor my feelings to improve my relationship with myself. I want to feel safe with myself. I think this is a big part of it. ",1755050731.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mom2qt,off my chest,"TW! I was diagnosed with BPD last year (age 25) following an attempt, and a longstanding mental health history. I have spent the last year healing as best as i can, however i have just ruined a relationship with someone i truly adored, due to my splitting. She was quite a laid back girly, and i am a girly who needs constant reassurance (im working on it). But she left because she thought it was too hard too soon (we were seeing each-other for 2 months and had 2 arguments and a few disagreements) and now i feel like im too hard to handle, because i will never be able to provide someone with that honeymoon period, as thats when i feel the most vulnerable to abandonment. I know with BPD people can get obsessed but with her, my heart just felt like she was right. As a lesbian i’m aware of the love bombing and quick paced nature our relationships can be, but it wasn’t like that. We’d been friends 9 years before at sixth form but drifted apart because she left during second year, and we met again in June this year, and the second i saw her again i thought shit she’ll be who i marry, or the reason i think love is fake. 

I know i’m not all to blame, but i hate the way my mind is, i hate that i confuse thought for fact, i hate that i wasn’t born this way and horrible people made my brain this way, i hate that no amount of therapy, dbt, cbt, medication, stops the spirals.

For the first time in about a year, I felt relief, I felt really hopeful in that I was going to learn how to deal so I could live with it.  I could learn how to deal and change my life.  Today, I found out that the provider does not take my hmo and is out of network.  

While I am still happy to have insurance, I am frightened! Given our shared experience with this disorder, I think it can be assumed why I am scared.  I wrote the insurance company to ask if Talkspace is covered, or something like it.  I need to be better!  I can't go on like this.  I am fine for the most part, but I really need therapy.

1moqktj,Partner Favorite,"Hi. I am poly with a husband and I had a partner of 6 months. The partner of 6 months (I'll call him 6) became my favorite very early on. I was very upfront with him about this. He was willing to work with me. We are deeply in love. I hatehateHATE having a favorite.

Having a favorite makes my behavior unhinged. And I've gotten pretty good about coping with a lot of it and having partners help where they can. 

But I am so sensitive and so easily hurt by my favorite in ways that do not occur with others. Like 6 would do the same things that husband does, and I would get hurt by 6 while be totally understanding of husband. And these are not bad things. They are not doing anything wrong. Like husband will not be up for sex and that's totally cool, I get it! 6 will not be up for sex and suddenly I'm convinced he thinks I'm disgusting, was never attracted to me, etc.

And I have BIG emotions. And I don't hide things. So when I'm hurt I bring it up. And it takes so much reassurance for me to believe the person.

And 6 tried so hard. We tried to work together. We tried to find ways to help my always (like daily) getting hurt and having intense conversations about it. He tried stepping back and not taking on responsibility for my emotions. I tried and failed to walk away and talk myself down without needing his reassurance. Things like that.

But it got too much, and this weekend he left me for his own mental health. He said we are not good for each other as we are. He said he cannot match my extremism. And I do not blame him. I am not angry. I am deeply sad and hurt to have hurt one of the loves of my life to this point. I am heartbroken at losing him because I couldn't control my own bad behavior.

I am in therapy. But I was wondering if anyone had any good coping mechanism for dealing with this kind of thing and not letting it affect your partner? How do you like stop having favorites?",1755046771.0,1,0,BPD,bpd

I find myself often telling my partner that I wish he hated me. I can’t ever seem to explain why. I wish he were with anyone else, not because I don’t love him, but because I love him too much to see him with me. He is a very good person who doesn’t deserve the constant drastic switches in emotion, and I wish he would leave me. I also wish he wouldn’t leave me. I don’t understand why I work so hard to push people away when I know that the second they leave I’ll just be miserable again. I appreciate all they do for me, but a part of me doesn’t physically respond as though I do… I’m not quite sure how to explain that they way I feel and react I can’t control.

I can't go a day without a huge emotional reaction to often minor inconviniances or an impulsive decision that will inevetably harm me. I am not on meds, my therapist stoped that since I showed no progress, and I have stoped going to therapy since that became pointless too. I can't cope by myself and it's somehow worse when I try to share the burden to my friends and family because no one understands the deepth and the harm it is to me. I selfharm on and off and even that has stoped giving me relif that it once did. I don't know how to stop feeling like the worst person on the plenet and like everything around me is fake including myself. I know it deep inside that I am no-ones number one exept to my abusive mother I am low contact with, the one person that makes me phisicly ill when I hear or see. And even when I was in a long loving relationship I was treated as a second best or just not as special as that person was to me which killed me even more. These episods of deep depression which are always followed by more self distructing mania, are all I know. The one moment were I felt true bliss and peace was 2 years ago and it's fading, I fear for the day that the memory of those 4 days are no longer enough to get me though. I don't want to die but my heart might break for the person I delusionaly invented in my mind that I wanted to be.

Does it ever stop, does it become better with age and time, is there a non bpd person that will understand me and love me for all of me? I am desperate to try anything......

1mohu01,Finally cut ties,"In college I made a friend who to be honest in hindsight wasn’t a good friend at all- He would randomly be rude and was hypocritical af while being aggressive about it. He never denied his hypocrisy but also never acknowledged it and it was getting on my nerves- He had already been acting weird to me ever since I came out as genderqueer and started being more distant and easily aggravated- Then during the summer I fell into depression and his reaction to me isolating myself was to tell me he was annoyed by it and to remove me from group chats for no reason- He had done that multiple times before and I kept being a fool and letting him back into my life- Today I had enough though. He once again was hypocritical af about me simply liking a certain character enough to use them as my pfp and I sorta half snapped, I wasn’t aggressive directly but I passive aggressively brought up his hypocrisy and rudeness- He refused to acknowledge it and just made a rude remark then left every group chat we were both in- I know I was probably in the right but I feel almost guilty about it.

1monhy3,I had a crisis in public,"So, I used to work at the grocery store near my house as a cashier until like two weeks ago. My best friend still works there and since I stopped working she suddenly stopped replying to my texts, unfollowed me on everything and would gossip about me with the other cashier. All of this happened after I attempted suicide and was hospitalized for three days. My FP,  who's a 25 year old man, works there too. We have hooked up a couple of times, but only kissing, not having sex. So, yesterday I go to the grocery store to buy bananas to cook oatmeal (my favorite food). As soon as I show up my ex-best friend rolls her eyes. I start to shake. I pick up the bananas and go straight to her checkout counter. I can't handle this anymore. I confront her about not talking to me and gossiping about me. I don't remember really well what I said, because I usually forget a lot about what happened during the crisis after I calm down. I remember calling her a coward. We started arguing. And then she said that she only stopped talking to me because my FP said I was going to invite both of them to go to a motel, and she thought that was disrespectful since she had a boyfriend. At this point things got even worse. My FP lives at his work, so I basically invaded the grocery store and started going up rounds of stairs while the manager (my FP's uncle) ran behind me. I knocked his door. No one answered. I knnocked again. Nothing. I told the manager I wouldn't live until I talked to him. He asked me to wait for him downstairs. We go back to the store. I start arguing with my ex-best friend again. The other cashier left. Suddenly I notice that I'm screaming and everyone is looking at me. The manager is calling my FP. I remember pointing my finger at my ex-best friend and she telling me to get it out of her face, but I answered her with: I PUT MY FINGER WHEREVER I WANT TO (the audacity...) I start saying I'm going to beat my FP's ass. I start crying. Suddenly my best friend isn't sure anymore if my FP said that I was gonna invite them to the motel or just to hang out. Apparently the other cashier had heard it and she wasn't sure of what he had said. So now I start saying that if the other cashier hadn't ran away I would slap her face. My ex-bestriend also says she got mad because her boyfriend followed me on my Instagram and I followed him back, and he also followed me on Twitter (I don't even have twitter downloaded). My FP shows up. He takes me out of the grocery store with my bananas. We talk. He tells me he hadnt said that. He told the other cashier I would invite them jus to go out. He has always been honest with me, even about the bad things. I know he wouldn't lie. ""You're pretty, smart and everyone likes you. That's why they are gossiping about you. They are jealous."" We end up talking for an hour about different things. It calmed me down, certainly, but I was very ashamed of the mess I made at the grocery store. I told him I would never go back there, but he said I should go back there and enter smiling and twerking lol. We walked the way to my house and he left me by the door. He says he is too bad for me and is going to make my life a mess, so we can't date. But really, I wished we could be more than just friends. So now my ex-best friend told me she was sorry, it was just gossip, and that she talked shit about me just to try to forget me. She wants to be my best friend again, but I'm just not being able to let it be. It feels wrong. I don't believe people change so quickly. God forbid a girl wanting to make her oatmeal.",1755038694.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1modgx3,Uncommon bpd experience?,"I browse this subreddit quite often and I see that most of the threads are about the experiences of having BPD and navigating relationships, either romantic or friendships. 

Interestingly enough, this is something I could relate to, but ever since I started taking an antidepressant my ""relationship-related bpd symptoms"" have substantially subsided.

For context: I am single, I don't have a lot of friends in life, live alone and work from home a lot — so it's not as if my exterior life improved, but somehow being under the effect of the medication has made relationships not the main focus of my life. Don't get me wrong, I still experience a deep sense of emptiness and loneliness, but I don't have a FP like before, nor do I experience constant instability with the few relationships I do have.

I'd say, if anything, being a bit of a lonely homebody makes me feel kinda safe from possible bad experiences with people (also, I just love not being perceived, but that's another problem haha).

That said... I still experience deep emotional instability, unstable sense of self, passive suicidal thoughts (anything that happens immediately gets me to ""what if I k* myself"" lol), hard to control anger, anxiety, etc. I'm at a constant war with myself inside my brain: pushing myself, judging myself, putting myself down. 
I also feel intense feelings towards others (specially work colleagues), but I am ""able"" to keep in and explode inside myself.

Does anyone else have a similar experience?

1momyi6,I feel like an abuser,"I was abused multiple ways growing up and I can’t believe I have let myself get this bad. I feel so horrible for my partner. I’ve been with him for 4 years and I have just been horrible recently. I wasn’t always this bad as I’m typically a happy and sweet caring person. But lately every little thing is triggering me where I’ll explode, I’ll start throwing things or storm off slamming doors. I feel horrible. It feels so justified for a split second then immediately after I am regretful and I feel so sorry for acting out that way. I can tell my partner is getting tired of it and I can’t say sorry anymore since they are just tired of it. I am working on myself so hard and trying not to have meltdowns and split so often. Seeing post saying “it never gets better” or post from partners of people with bpd saying “just leave it won’t get better” makes me feel terrible. I love him so much and I just want to get better/do better for him. And I hope he knows I’m trying and I want to be his sweet girl again. I can’t take this feeling of being distant and being pushed away because of it. But I do deserve it. I can’t believe I let myself get so bad I hate that I made him feel like this.

it's very early into our relationship, and i know that there's no reason to move in together yet but i'm fighting every day not to bring up the conversation more seriously. i've lived with my previous partners as well, and i'm not wanting to repeat patterns. i do also enjoy having my own space the way i know she does. when i think of things logically i know that there's a lot of reasons to avoid rushing moving in together, and realistically i'd like to wait to see how we handle the holiday season. but there's always that list of ""pros"" in the back of my head that makes me want to mention it to her more seriously.

1momjqr,I'm super ashamed of waking up to how I harassed an ex fp. I didn't even realize I was doing it.,"**In short for the backstory:** he was physically violent, frequently screamed at me while on drugs. We made up. Then more screaming happened and we fell apart. We made up. Then he accuses me of absolute bs of stealing his mom's hair and his (removed) wisdom teeth. We made up. Then someone beat his ass and I got accused because they were my friend, and I did not ask them to beat him up. He refused to speak and told people I betrayed him, and I snapped and the texting spree began.

----------------


**The current state:**

Oh my god. I literally **just** realized what I'd done. This past half year I felt right because of all he did to me, and told him so. I used to harass this man every weekend with multiple texts from december last year to march of this year while blackout drunk. I honestly don't remember any of it besides the final text. I deluded myself that I was fine and it was hardly anything and his lack of response meant he didn't even see it. How did I convince myself of that?

It's a lot of pathetic begging and constant texting, sometimes 3-12 long texts a night. The final one was furious and telling him to fuck off of my friends, since he kept trying to bother them when they didn't wanna be bothered (probably to warn them I'm a psycho).

How do I cope with this? Especially the fact that some people in iur small community know? Can I ever regain trust from the community who knows? He avoid a lot of common social grounds he used to love because of me (I don't bother him irl, only over text, but yk why still), and I know who knows.

1moln2n,"""You were a victim of your parents, but he was the victim of you.'","Update on my therapy journey, so besides my DBT sessions with my therapist, my one friend/roommate also has materials he has from his time as a counselor for DBT. So its like getting two therapy sessions.

But todays therapy session was brutal.

My ex boyfriend was NOT abusive, in fact he was a golden retriever in some ways and just a total green flag. But I didn't love him, and I was worried he was gonna turn abusive, so I pushed him away. It was jarring and it really messed him up, hence my previous posts.

But the thing that has been brutal in my therapy session is neither my friends or my therapist are pulling their punches when it comes to my behavior anymore.

My mother was a narcissist, and when I tried to defend my actions for brutally dumping my ex, my therapist cut me off by asking 'Did your mother use this same logic to defend herself?""

My blood ran cold because.....my therapist was right. I was acting just like my mother. And I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt come over me.

Then in my group therapy session, I mentioned how I was paranoid my ex was going to turn abusive and they were like 

""You were the abusive one, and for the record, you had to have known deep down he wasn't abusive, because if he was? The horrible shit you said to him your last week together would have gotten your ass kicked if he was abusive. Instead he had the patience of a saint even when you were mistreating him.'

The sad part is I can remember one time during a depressive episode my ex told me this and its haunting me now.

*""I've been dumped for mental health problems before, and I promise you I won't leave you because you're struggling.""* 

And I realized just how abusive I was because I literally abandoned him when he was struggling. Because he was paying all my bills, paying for my groceries, he sold a lot of his hobby stuff for money to......

The worst part was finding out he was planning on proposing to me soon. And I just abused him.

Therapy is one of the most painful things I've ever had to do.

And frankly.....maybe I don't deserve a happy relationship after this, because how can I deserve one knowing what I did to the ONE guy who was willing to stick around?",1755034217.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mollz2,What should i do?,"Ever since I was young, I have always been made to feel that I wasn’t enough. I was always compared to my intelligent cousins who did everything right. And when they surpassed me, I would never hear the end of it. I have experienced tremendous loss of friendships but there’s one, in particular, that I remember even after 6 years and it still hurts me. I was in this relationship where I was made to feel not enough and was always walking on eggshells. Everytime I tried to express my discomfort I was hit with an “you can leave if you want” or an “you are the one who asked me to be your girlfriend, I never came to you”. Everything was so toxic and the embarrassing thing is that I never noticed that until I was out of the relationship. I was dehumanized and humiliated multiple times. I used to cry every night. Why did I stay for that? I would be lying if I said I have a straight answer. Maybe I enjoyed the pain because it made me feel like i was right that I cannot be loved. Maybe I was in denial. Maybe I thought I could never find love anywhere else. Now, after that relationship, I still remember everything that happened vividly. All the time I was treated like garbage. I broke down and developed eating disorders after the relationship. Everytime some certain words are said I remember something that happened. And the fact that the person explicitly told me that I was not enough which proved my claim. I have never felt enough. Fast forward to now; I’m in a new relationship. Every chance I get, I sabotage myself. Because I don’t feel like I’m enough and I miss the pain. I’m always waiting for the person to hurt me. And most of the time, I’m just participating in the relationship but my mind is just anticipating pain. I love this person but I am being so unfair. I just feel like I deserve pain ,you know. I must not be loved because what’s there to love. If the others left, why would this one stay. I don’t have much going on. This relationship is the nice thing i have right now and I’m trying to blow it as soon as possible. I can’t even enjoy her presents because I’m always thinking that they are fed up with my company. I still feel like I’m not enough but my partner is now suffering because they feel like they can’t do anything right and they feel like they aren’t doing enough. I feel like they should just leave me if they want happiness and peace because I’m beyond saving. I don’t even talk about what’s bothering because I fear that I might lose them. So I write my thoughts down.
I try to not express my feelings much because of fear. I don’t know what I should do. Clearly, I’m weighing my partner down and as much as I love this person, I feel like they are better off without me. Rather, I think of myself as the bare minimum the world has to offer.

I ended up popping a molly and he was being really nice to me and we had sex but he still didn’t want to take me back. 

When I was coming down off the molly I wanted to buy ket, he sold me his own. Then when it got late he wanted me gone but I wanted to stay with him and wouldn’t get on the bus. I ended up walking around alone on the streets at night in his area while he met his friends, managed to get a strangers phone to call him and he ended up picking me up. Went to hang out with him and his friends and I got really high and my (ex) bf let me stay the night. 

I woke up and started crying cause I remembered everything that happened and I got high again while he slept. When he woke up he wanted me gone again. I tried to stretch the time, I wish I didn’t, he had told me he hates me, that i was embarrassing him, and threatened me with a restraining order. Eventually we went to the same bus stop where I refused to leave the night prior. I kept talking and pleading and didn’t want to leave before I could “fix things” he told me if I didn’t get on the bus he’d start running. I told him that I can’t and he may as well start running and he actually did so I got on the bus and left. 

Over text I begged him too, he blocked and unblocked me, said we could be friends. The last time I messaged him was like 2 days ago? I basically told him I love him and to please let us try again. He left that on seen and became friends with a girl with the same name as me on instagram and that made me completely disgusted.

I thought folks could have free opinions on interests, but having an opinion can really ruffle some feathers even when I say it respectfully. It’s very activating almost like exposure therapy.

1mo92w8,Love with BPD,"Hello everyone,

English is not my first language, so I hope what I write will make sense.

I wanted to share something that has been on my mind a lot lately, and I’d really like to hear your thoughts.

I have a diagnosed borderline personality disorder, and I’ve been in a relationship for a little over a year with someone who knows nothing about mental illnesses (he has never experienced them himself and has no close ones who have). Still, he supported me as best as he could during a major depression last year. He is very kind and very much in love, but he is also extremely rational: when I feel bad for no clear reason, he immediately tries to analyze and rationalize instead of just sitting with my feelings.

We also have different love languages. For him, it’s mostly loving words; for me, it’s small, concrete gestures (bringing a cake when the other is sad, planning a surprise date, taking me somewhere special). He has tried doing this once because he knew I liked it, but it’s not something that comes naturally to him.

Because of this, I often find myself wondering: am I with the right person? Sometimes I think I’d be better with someone who understands my disorder, or even better off alone… and sometimes, the very next moment, I think he’s the love of my life.

He once told me that I can’t be “the eighth wonder of the world” to him because he also has his work, friends, and family. But for me, it feels like I need my partner to give me almost all of their time and energy… and I don’t know if that’s normal, or if it’s my borderline making me ask for too much.

So my question for you is: in your relationships, how do you tell the difference between “normal” needs and needs that are amplified by the disorder? And for you, what is love?

I’m not saying I’m like amazing in relationships or perfect this isn’t about how you show up in a relationship it’s about like a raw type of like actual love that’s really hard to describe.

1mnzmzu,I’m exhausted in every way a person can be.,"Just getting this off my chest because I know others here have gone through similar things, and I’m hoping I’ll feel a little less alone.

I’m 33F and past year has been overwhelming. My house flooded, and I’ve been living alone in my grandmother’s house for eight years while she’s across the country.

My family basically left me here to survive on my own. While I don’t pay rent, the upkeep yard work, cleaning and repairs. It really feels impossible with BPD, C-PTSD, major depression, and poor executive functioning. I’ve slipped into hoarding, binge eating, endless naps whenever I get the chance. 

For context my childhood was far from stable. My mom lost custody of me when I was 11 due to severe alcoholism. She later passed away in a house fire in 2019. My father with narcissistic, personality disorder remarried and I don’t exist within his new perfect family. They always kept me at a distance, but this past year they’ve pushed me away completely for being “too much.” When I finally cried in front of him, his response was, “You must be on drugs.”

They’re anti-medication, even though I only see someone once a month for support. 

I also have a younger brother with severe autism and epilepsy who lives in a residential home, 
He’s non verbal and I was never able to bond with him. 

On top of it all, I’m in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, and can’t even afford to file for bankruptcy.

As for work that has taken over my life, I care for special needs children It’s basically all I know. I barely survive on the income. The job drains me so much that all my hobbies and interests have disappeared and maintaining relationships feels impossible. Everyone says to get a cat or dog and the icing on the cake is, I love them but I’m highly allergic. To say the least, I’m exhausted physically, mentally, and emotionally.

TL;DR- No support system, severe burnout, and lifelong trauma.

1mobn7u,When is it okay to believe your own narrative?,"I’m trying to figure out a way to not overdo it in the whole self-awareness thing. It’s easy for me to lock into a negative memory and ruminate on it, on my flaws, past mistakes, etc. I frequently obsess over my last relationship and whether I was abusive/capital A abuser. It’s hard to know for certain because my ex did not communicate when things bothered them. I also learned not to ask because they’d get upset just trying to name their emotions.  

I also realized recently that my ex assaulted me quite early on in our relationship, like the first date, essentially. I tried to tell myself it wasn’t a big deal at the time, but now I wonder if it influenced how I acted in the relationship, how upset I’d get when my other boundaries were violated, or how my emotions would escalate if I wasn’t being listened to. There was a pattern where my ex would ignore my needs or boundaries when I’d express them verbally, I’d have a breakdown, and then they’d work to do better. I feel weird about it now, but I also feel weird about the fact that they wouldn’t listen otherwise. They’d poke my body, keep me up at night, enter my room without permission, and ignored me the first time I asked them to move out. 

I’m also scared I’m using DARVO or justifying myself. I don’t think I was healthy. But I also know I like to pin the blame on myself because it feels safer to be the problem. At least, less uncomfortable than the fact that I was violated and still stuck around for 2 years. 

At what point can I step back and say I understood what happened, even if I likely don’t understand everything that happened? My therapist doesn’t think it’s serving me to think of myself as abusive, and that abusers don’t sit around contemplating their actions. I don’t really know. This sounds bad, but I wish the assault never happened so I could put the problem solely on me.

I feel gross.",1755012092.0,2,0,BPD,bpd
1mo66j8,Long distance relationships,"Hey everyone,

I’m in a long-distance relationship right now with someone I care about a lot, and I could really use some advice from people who get what it’s like to have BPD in the mix. 

The distance is tough. I’ve been noticing that when we can’t talk as much or our schedules don’t match up, I start feeling jealous, insecure, or even scared they might leave. I’m trying to stay self-aware and not let those feelings run the show, but it’s not always easy. I really struggle with social media, monitoring what he’s doing/who he’s following, and spiraling when he is out partying and meeting new people. 

For those of you who’ve done long distance:
- What helped you feel connected and secure with your partner?
-How did you handle jealousy or fear of abandonment without letting it blow up the relationship?
-Did you have any routines, boundaries, or communication habits that made things easier for both of you?

I really want to approach this in a healthy way, and I’d love to hear what worked (or even what didn’t work) for you.

Thanks ❤️",1754998314.0,4,2,BPD,bpd
1mo7jla,I react poorly to criticism. I want to detach.,"It all feels like an attack, even when I laugh it off and am sure it's not. Someone replies, I scoff or laugh it off. I tell myself I don't care even though I've thought about it a dozen times.

This all applies to real life situations as well as some interactions on this app. (Focusing more on the app here though.) It's at a point where it eats me up so much so that I imagine some response but am too afraid to go through with it, (Which drives me up the walls) or I do go though with it, already an emotional mess, and end up deleting everything afterwards. It makes me feel pathetic.

These past few years, I've wanted nothing to do with people, and in this I've found solace, but whenever I reach out, I am sometimes met with something as simple as some dickwad talking out of their ass, and the cycle resets. At this point, I loathe coming to people for help, and yet, here I am. I want to accept criticism at times but I feel I'm too emotional. 

I hate this cycle. Is there help, or am I stuck being a fucking emotional pin cushion to poke and prod at for strangers on the internet?

Thanks.

1moadyi,Understanding my emotions,"The intense build up of emotions made me feel 3 ways: angry, depressed and numb. 
That’s just how I said I felt all the time. 

In one of my group therapy session we were starting the day by learning and identifying different emotions. It felt so childish and condesending at the time lmaooo 
But honestly, at the end of the day, I really needed someone to teach me. 

No, I wasnt always feeling sad/depressed. 
Sometimes, I was confused, bored, anxious, lonely, tired, etc. 

Same thing when I felt intense anger. 
Sometimes I was embarrassed, disappointed, hurt, irritaded… and so on.

1mogc0j,Anyone else thought they were in remission until an extreme situation happened?,"I was diagnosed with BPD after my first hospitalization in 2020. 3 years later, after so much work and self-reflection, my therapist discussed the concept of remission with me. I moved a few months later and saw several new therapists until I found my current one, all who did not believe I fit the criteria. I stopped identifying as having BPD, though I was still struggling with depression and other symptoms that have been explained with a recent OCD diagnosis. 

Last year I started having some major work issues and my depression spiraled. It culminated in a suicide attempt early 2025 that I had planned out for months. I self-interrupted and was hospitalized again. Even throughout this and the healing process afterwards, I wasn’t meeting the full diagnosis anymore. 

Then… 4 months after my attempt, while I was still far from recovered, my friends all decided to leave our friendship. Real abandonment. I totally lost it yall. As soon as I realized they really weren’t my friends anymore (unnecessary rant with details in a few paragraphs down below) I blocked all of 3 them. I wish I hadn’t, because maybe they would have explained or reached out or something. I shut down completely for a few days and was drinking heavily. Then I did it. I got onto my second account and sent them all messages, mostly begging for answers but particularly nasty towards one girl (my closest friend). She then added us all to a group chat and we argued. I kept begging for answers, of course I wasn’t entitled to any. It was really bad.

Since then, it seems all my old BPD symptoms are back and in full swing. I’m splitting on my amazing boyfriend and my family. Impulsive as hell. I used to struggle with stress-induced paranoia and I’m not sure if it was a medication I was on or not, but for a while a few months ago I was acting similarly to how I used to. I’m terrified of my boyfriend and family leaving me. I think I’m starting to make some uphill progress, including having the ability to write this all out and post it. But it’s been so hard and I thought I was out of this fight. Can anyone relate to thinking they were in remission?


UNNECESSARY RANT:

My best friend really supported me after I got out of the hospital. I literally stayed over at her place every day for over a month while she WFH. I was so grateful and I tried to show it, but I was still really struggling. I was still actively suicidal. I guess it took its toll on us both too much. 

There was one week in particular, after I had been staying by myself again, where I was really struggling. I was slow to respond and distant. Then she ignored me for a few days, and I sent a snarky text. She responded, we ended up both admitting that we had felt a little distant. I apologized and tried to make sure she knew how much I loved and appreciated her. I told her she can always reach out about issues, and I thought we had it worked out (even though I suspect one of her responses was chatgpt?!?!)

Anyways, I never saw her or our other friends again lol. For a couple of weeks they pretended everything was fine. But they took me off their private stories and turned off locations. All hangouts were “cancelled”. One of the girl’s birthdays came and went, and the get together was “cancelled” (after I blocked them the pics were all posted… I threw away the clay trinket dish gift I made). 

For some reason they continued to make plans with me just to cancel. Finally my best friend told me that she had been feeling weird about hanging out. We sent a few messages back n forth, she tried to say that it was because I took too long to respond in group chats lol. I sent her a few very mature and calm messages expressing my wish to continue the friendship but understand if she doesn’t. Then I crashed out when she didn’t respond after a day, sent another nasty text and blocked them all. A few days later is when I got on my second account as said above. I hate myself. 

I get that no one is entitled to have anyone else in their life. If someone doesn’t want to be around me anymore that’s okay. I just wish they hadn’t led me on like that I guess? I wish they would’ve been more mature about it. I totally get how I wasn’t being a great friend. I was being distant, and I was rude when it was turned around on me. And then I crashed tf out and have been ever since. Fuck me.

1moa5za,I can't stop hating and blaming myself,"Recently got diagnosed with BPD. I come from a lower middle class family where money has always been tight. Two fatal attempts later (the previous one being in March where I was under coma and ventilation for about a month), I've been finally diagnosed with BPD. I have had severe CPTSD for the last 5-6 years, with lots of minor unalive attempts and self harm. I've destroyed major chunks of my life in my own hands, and my family has paid for it. It is so tiring to see them struggle so much for money, especially when most of the costs are spent behind my physical and mental treatment. I give them fake hope that I'm going to get better, when I know I won't and it kills me to know that they would still trust me blindly. You'd tell me therapy helps, but even therapy costs so much money, I'd rather have myself dead. I frankly have no idea what to do at this point.",1755008719.0,2,0,BPD,bpd

1mo9q3e,"I'm so confused, and I don't know what to do about my Ex/pwBPD","My pwBPD and I have been off and on for 5 years, but mostly together during that time.

She hasn't had therapy for her BPD, tried to go once, had an episode, and never tried again, and isn't on any medication.

We've had 3 incidents over the last 5 years where she either did or said something so serious that it lead me to break up with her, either temporarily for some space, or for what I wanted to be permanent at the time, which has really eroded her trust for me and a long-term future together.

Some how, some way, we'd always end up back together, but that changed the last time I broke up with her.

We had almost 2 months of no contact, before I reached out her to reconcile, as I had been going through some really difficult times mentally myself, breaking up with her wasn't the best reaction and I wanted to make things right.

Since then we've had some downs but a lot of ups, and until last week I felt like we were in the best place we'd been with each other all year, even though we still haven't gotten back together officially.

Everything seemed to change though, last week she went on a 5 day vacation with a lady friend, the first 3 days were completely fine, we didn't talk much but she seemed upbeat and I knew she was busy, but by the 4th day there was a clear shift in mood, and she mentioned that the trip had been mentally challenging for her but didn't say why, then on the 5th and 6th day, the day she was coming back, she didn't send me a single message, which surprised me, but I continued to give her space and didn't message her until the next day.

In the morning on the day she returned I messaged asking if she was ok and hoping she got home safe, to be met with a blunt ""Sorry, I need time, are you ok?"", I took that as oh she needs to rest and recharge after a busy week of travelling and socialising, but then hours later she's uploading stories on instagram of her out riding her motorbike and going out for food with friends, which she proceeded to do all weekend still without messaging me or giving me any explanation why she was being so cold all of a sudden, this is also really out of character for her, she does occasionally post stories on instagram but they aren't usually so personal and she would never post 10 in 9 hours, and just felt odd to me because she'd know that I'd be able to see them.

What's even more confusing is she wanted to see me the weekend before she left but just didn't have time, suggested we start a business together the week before that, and asked me last time I saw her with genuine concern if I was talking to any other women, so I'm feeling really lost.

It's been 4 days since she said she needed time, and I'm torn between giving her more space to process her feelings and reach out to me to explain why she's acting this way, or taking the initiative myself, sending her a final message, and blocking her on all socials, as well as her number, and going no contact for good.

I don't know if it's my brain that's making me assume the worst, but it really feels like she's already made a decision but can't find the courage to be honest with me, even after some of our deep/emotional chats earlier this year she never ghosted me like this.

1mngxwc,High Emotional Awareness with BPD feels like the worst combination,"Tldr: my therapist said I had high emotional intelligence, and that not enough people I meet have the same awareness to meet me where I need to be met.

I was in a long discussion with my therapist. There was various relationships that fell apart for various reasons, with the worst being that I was used a means to cheat by my ex as revenge to his cheating girlfriend (which he cheated on me with initially), and my most recent being with a friend who only ever reached out to me for emotional support and to send brainrot Instagram reels. As I explained my situations, how I felt, and what I did with every conflict that raised. Soon, my therapist noticed ""you are not being too much of too sensitive, you're just emotionally intelligent.""

I asked what they meant, and they explained that I was not overreacting or doing anything wrong. I reacted very collected, where instead of blowing up or being quick to blame anyone, I still wanted to connect to find growth and truth. Its that in combination with my BPD, that when my needs have not been met long enough I blow up out of control. The issue arises that my needs have been neglected by others because their emotional awareness was significantly lower than mine, in addition to my ""maturity"" where I seek long lasting depth instead of intensity.

I don't know this could have just all been stuff to make me feel better about what happened in my life, and why I still struggle to make friends from being actually being too sensitive to other people. ",1754928039.0,81,11,BPD,bpd

I want to continue to be friends. I really loved and cared for this person and it was sad to lose our relationship. After she broke up with me she immediately wanted to get back together and I didn’t because it was really hurtful to be broken up with and I needed boundaries.

I’ve been this way my whole life, overly sensitive, intense with my emotions, and stuck in patterns I can’t seem to break. I often feel like a teenager trapped in an adult’s body.

Right now, I’m in the healthiest relationship I’ve ever had. My boyfriend never gives up on me
he listens, supports me, and stays through all my moods. But I’m either extremely happy or extremely sad, with no middle ground. I know it can be “too much,” and while I find it cringe and exhausting, I can’t control it. I constantly fear he’ll eventually get tired of me and leave.

Around friends, I mask my real self. After hanging out, I overthink every conversation and convince myself they hate me or talk about me behind my back. Sometimes I even imagine they have a secret group chat just to dislike me. I send them reels and feel hurt or angry if they don’t react, which makes me spiral into wanting to “get new friends” and restart the cycle.
And sometimes I make new friends I’m really really good at making friends and now I have a lots of friends n I can’t give everyone time too 
I left home three years ago because I couldn’t live up to my parents’ expectations. I live alone now, unmedicated. I can’t keep up with cooking, eating properly, or cleaning
unless someone’s visiting, then I rush to make everything perfect because I’m scared of being judged.

When I’m angry, I sometimes say hurtful, irreversible things I don’t truly mean, but doing so gives me a strange, temporary calm. I hate this about myself. I wish there was a medicine to balance my mood swings before they ruin the only relationship where I’ve truly felt loved and safe.

1mo14be,First Ever Romantic Relationship,"This is my first ever post to Reddit ever! I’m a newly 20 year old woman, and have recently entered a relationship with my new partner. I wish to receive the most real, honest, and maybe harsh advice for maintaining a healthy partnership. I care deeply about my partner as a human being, and I do not wish to harm him in any way. Even if we aren’t meant to be together, I need his happiness to be put first as he is a very kind, honest, and thoughtful man. He deserves a kind, honest, and thoughtful partner. (:

For context:

• I am NOT diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I have often suspected from a young age that I was “different” from my peers, and I thought/behaved abnormally. This has caused me to seek out answers pertaining to my psyche which evidently led me here. (: 

• I am no expert nor have any experience with BPD beyond the humble search bar. I know how damaging it can be to this community to “self-diagnose” oneself with this behavioral disorder, and my intention is not to do that. I’m a very depressed and  mentally ill girl, and I deeply wish (and hope) I am not afflicted with this disorder. 

• The main reason I haven’t gone to a psychiatrist is because I’m scared. I don’t want to have to explain to my close friends/family about my BPD because of the negative stereotypes and stigmatization around it! I fear that they all will soon think I am “crazy” or whatever word I know my mother would come up with unfortunately. (:<

1mnm292,Boyfriend tells me that no one would be able to handle my bpd,"It’s kind of defeating to hear that from someone you love. It makes me feel like a problem for something I didn’t cause but try to manage. I always talk in a calm tone, if I slip up and ‘have an accusatory tone’ I apologise and reword, I acknowledge his feelings and offer support. The second I even mention an emotion he tells me ‘It’s always about your feelings. Fuck that’. ‘No one can please you. Nothing I do is ever enough. No one would be able to handle this’. 

I’ve had a mental health stay booked for the end of the month (3 week inpatient program) to try to combat strong emotions stemming from recent stress. I sat with him months ago weighing the idea of this and checking in with how he felt about the temporary time apart/ trials of medications etc. He was kind of dry about it but said he had no issues and supported the decision. 

He’s now told me that I need to ‘deal with the consequences of my actions’ about not being able to see each other for 4 weeks (week holiday before my stay). I expressed disappointment at him only seeing me for 12 hours before I leave. He told me to stop guilt tripping him and that he can miss me at his own pace. That he needed to fix his PlayStation before coming here (he is cat sitting for me for a week which I appreciate and understand) and that he doesn’t want to inconvenience himself just to see me a day earlier. He’s been on 2 long holidays with his family and friends, both in which I dog sat with nothing expected in return. Stayed with him right up until the last second. Picked him up from the airport. Didn’t complain or suggest there should be consequences. It feels hurtful that he’s treating my effort at getting support this way. 

I’m sitting here thinking ?? Am I wrong to feel disappointed? Am I guilt tripping? Am I doing something wrong in getting support? Did I not communicate effectively? Am I a bad partner? Was I misunderstanding? 

I speak to my mum, she reads over the messages and she tells me to leave him. She says that every time she is more and more amazed at how manipulative he is being. 

To make things worse we worked things out only because I apologised again. Only for a few hours later him to shoot me a message whilst I’m sick with the flu asking me to cover for him for his friends that we were both sick the other night when we cancelled. He never once cared that I was sick but asked me to cover for him. I literally just said ‘can you please check in with me next time before asking me to pretend for you’ I set a bloody boundary again about not wanting to be in the middle of something and that guaranteed a half an hour of ‘it’s always about you’ to which I’m saying ok I’m sorry just for it to stop at this point. 

Am I too much or is this just another stupid situation? I’m starting to bloody mentally check out at this point so I’d like to know if I’m the one creating the problems ",1754939290.0,33,31,BPD,bpd

You can sit, lay down, hold hands, side hug, cuddle. You just develop a therapeutic, platonic relationship with someone and they're there for you. They can travel with you, go out, stay in, give you head scratches, read you a book. It won't make up for my mother not holding me, but maybe it will help me feel safe.

1mo3umi,I can't sleep this fucking sucks,"I have a job interview today, I can't sleep . I looked up some shit about the job relating to driving and other things and I'm just paranoid and tired and slightly suicidal. I really want this job, I love teaching art to kids and I'm confident I'll probably get it , since I used to be a art teacher and worked as a after-school group leader , but split on a coworker who was being really emotionally abusive to me and I lost it in front of my students , so I'm scared of going back . The kids don't really trigger me as long as I have support , but I'm worried this might be another toxic workplace where I just leave . But even the commute ( they're expecting me to drive to different schools and some people said they might be super far), also someone on indeed said the pay isn't worth the number of hours you work. I'm looking for very part-time anyways , but I'm worried about it all. I can't have a job like I normal person. I just got diagnosed with BPD like a few weeks ago , so it's getting to me, also my therapist said I do have some autistic traits, but we could diagnose that since we we're focused only on BPD for about 1 1/2 to 2 hrs. Plus me being premature, I'm just sensitive and overwhelmed and I low-key want to sleep again , but my body is in so much physical and mental agony I just hate it. I'm vaping weed and trying to relax because I'm so close to engaging in self harm behaviors like head banging or pulling my hair and trichophagia. I wish people actually understood mental health issues, not just my boyfriend because he's very understanding and accepting, but mostly society. I do have the ability with my boyfriend not to work at all and just work on my passion as a artist . But with AI and just the aspect of dealing with others opinions and that could cause me to have b&w thinking towards myself which usually leads to self harm or harming others. So like how do I hold down a job IF EVERY LITTLE THING TRIGGERS ME . ugh this shit is the worst. I just want to sleep all day and rot , but I have this fucking interview. I'm going to it because I want the job, but also I can care less. I just can't get attached.",1754990183.0,2,0,BPD,bpd

She has said she loves me and even as of a few hours ago has said she loves me. She insists her feelings are unchanged.

I was recently in the hospital for a month (unrelated to the diagnosis) and now that I'm home, I was reading the hospital report and it said one of the things I'd been diagnosed with in the past was BPD. 

I was never told this by my psychiatrist. I thought I might have it a few years ago, but hadn't thought about it since. And now that I have a confirmation, my head is blowing up. So many things make so much sense now. I feel kinda sick actually. And depressed. Why didn't my psychiatrist say anything? Ive been feeling like something was wrong with me for years. 

I'm not sure how to deal with this. How to cope. I read about the ""symptoms"" and it broke my heart that I am the way I am because of this.

Not to mention that I’m also autistic, and they don’t believe that diagnosis because they only know of autism being the main stereotype of a boy having a meltdown.

They don’t believe any of my diagnosis’s and it’s really frustrating. I don’t know how to have a relationship with them when they’re like this.

1mo3i21,Being aware of my BPD hasn’t stopped it,"I’ve known for a long time now that I had BPD, since my teenage years (maybe around a decade ago). When I remember the way I acted at times I wondered how I could be so thoughtless. I thought because I am older now I would magically be able to deal with it if it ever became a problem again. Well here I am, and it’s a problem and I can’t deal with it like I think I should be able to. 
Yesterday night I knew I was acting up again, feeling insecure about my relationship with my FP. I don’t really know why because lately just about anything sets me off. But that night I tried to be mature while also talking about the way I feel instead of bottling it up, so I did text my FP (who is my long distance partner, at least I still hope so, but after this I don’t know) saying that I was so tired of having BPD and getting so anxious and freaked out all the time. For context, the last few weeks, for reasons I really don’t understand, I’ve broken down several times over extremely mundane things.  For example, I had to go to work to fill in for someone else instead of playing games with my partner and friends online and I was so so upset, when my partner and friends said “we miss you” I said “no you don’t.” I continued to act miserable and mopey and I’m sure they all noticed. It’s so embarrassing and I could tell I was doing it but couldn’t stop myself. When I told my partner/FP about being tired of acting this way, they were nothing short of understanding and patient as always. I was very happy for that, but it wasn’t enough to stop the feeling that night. When after I had sent some more messages venting they didn’t respond. I knew they were online still, their status said they were playing a game. I resolved to just leave it alone and said nothing more and went to sleep. I woke up early this morning, before they did, and the BPD still had hold of me, first I just sent an emoji expressing my dismay at being left on read. Then a few minutes later I said something like “guess you were tired of responding”. It’s so pathetic. But I just felt so upset that they just kind of ignored me even though they responded to all my other messages. I then went back to sleep for a little bit before I had to get up for work. I woke up to a message from them that said “i was asleep”. I guess they took that to mean right then, early that morning, but I meant earlier when I had sent my original messages and could see they were still awake. I didn’t want to correct them because I knew it was stupid. A few hours passed, I went to work, eventually said “my bad,” with no response a few minutes later elaborated with “im sorry”. They responded a bit later with “it’s alright” but the general feeling I got from the whole thing was that they were just tired of me and my behavior, which I understand. I felt worse because of it. I saw instead of saying anything else to me for a while they went to play games with other people while I was at my job. I just felt miserable like I had ruined everything by being annoying. They hate me. They’re tired of me constantly having mental breakdowns. Whenever they’re upset enough with me to not talk to me it throws me into a spiral (to the point of tears, usually, scratching and clawing at myself, hitting at my head. And I was at work so I just felt like a bomb ready to go off). So I spiraled. Tried to give it an hour before doing or saying anything, I don’t even know if I made it that long, then I left every active group chat we shared. I was trying to do damage control (at least part of me thinks so, part of me thinks it was just trying to get the jump and leave others before they can leave me) and stop myself from saying anything else, but I think what I did just screwed it up as much if not more than if I just had sent more messages.  Now they must really hate me. I haven’t heard a word from them or anyone else in the group chats I left. Nobody bothered to check on me and see if I’m okay, which really hurts. I just feel like an awful person and I deserve to be ignored and left but it hurts so badly. 
Not too long ago I sent them a DM saying I was sorry but I understand if they don’t want to talk to me anymore. 
I guess I just wanted to vent somewhere because I leapt out of the actual outlets I had for no good reason. I hate this stupid fucking disorder and I wish it would just GO AWAY because I’m sick of ruining my own life and I’m sick of my brain catching fire literally every single day. I’m sick of being stupid and selfish and pathetic when nothing is actually wrong. I hate myself.",1754988858.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mnoy2p,I have no real personality,"I’ve had diagnosed BPD for a few months now but it has been going around for many many years. 

To put it shortly, my problem is that I have no sense of who I am. I can change my whole personality anyday anywhere I want like magic. I adjust myself differently to my friends, family and other friends. Everyone. And as I spend time with people, or too long reading a book or watching a show I begin to mimic the people who I am jealous of (or just want to be). 

But also because I am bpd, it always goes overboard at some point so I have to “restart” my brains to zero where I have no personality. Thats the point when I am so depressed I will not speak for some time, just watch very changing things like TikTok/instagram and just play games that secure no personality. 

Then I choose a person or persons who I would like to be and rebuild my whole personality and everything around them but very carefully so it’s not obvious. Like it could be my one friend’s humour, one person’s speaking style, my mother’s empathy and brother’s style. Or that all could be my crush’s everything. They all vary very much. 

The cycle just keeps repeating and therapy doesn’t help. Partly, become I got weirdly obsessed with my therapist and started copying and being her because I hate myself (or whatever I am). Started acting like her and all. This has happened with all my last 5 therapists and nothing seems to help. 

And just for the record I do NOT do this on purpose. Sometimes it would be my brother (who has seen me change personalities countless times) to point out that I’m doing it again. We were once watching a tv show for maybe three episodes and when we turned it off, I was mimicking one of the characters without noticing it myself. I was surprised when he dared to accuse me of copying (I did not know I had bpd at this point). 

So honestly I don’t know what to do, but I do get it now why our life expectancy isn’t past 30💔",1754945805.0,10,4,BPD,bpd

*I am seeing a therapist and will talk to her about this at my next appointment with her. Also I am finding a new med management doctor that might take a look at my mood stabilizers.*

My emotions have been such a rollercoaster lately, A single text could send me spiraling and a single text could bring me back to joy, it hasn’t been like this in nearly 2 years and I’m just disappointed. The last 7 months has been pretty rough because my mom was diagnosed with cancer and has been going through Chemo, I’ve also had changes in my own health and I’m suddenly responsible for all the pets and the household maintenance, it’s been getting better now that my mom is done with her main chemo treatments and my dad is starting to help more. 

Another difficult thing is for some reason my urge to sleep with someone has come back, I don’t even know how to explain it other than aimless lust, it makes me worried I’ll impulsively enter a relationship for the wrong reasons because it’s a feeling I don’t understand and previously resulted in my making bad choices. 

It just feels like my grip on my emotional regulation and impulse control is slipping. 
I’m still way better than I was a year or more ago, like therapy and everything I’ve done has helped but not being able to regulate my emotions is a problem. Just a few weeks ago it lead to me **almost** having a major car accident because I was so caught up in my own emotions and thoughts that my situational awareness wasn’t really working even when I was trying to focus. Getting more sleep kind of helps but it’s hard to do 

I just kind of don’t know what’s going wrong, my mind tells me my life has just gone to shit (kinda has) and my body just tells me I need to go fuck somebody but I know for a fact that doesn’t help at all, my emotions tell me it’s the end of the world 😂😭",1754975175.0,2,3,BPD,bpd

1mnmt7p,can chronic boredom be a mask for emptiness in BPD?,"so i am being evaluated by a psychologist for BPD. i took a generalized test and it came back that i display bpd traits, not the full disorder (which is my mistake asking for only a generalized assessment). i do believe that i meet at least 5 out of 9 symptoms for bpd, but i have always questioned if i experience “chronic emptiness.” i did read that people with bpd can be bored a lot if they aren’t actively experiencing extreme emotions, such as not romanticizing about a favorite person and etc. in my personal life i do experience a lot of boredom day to day which causes me to seek out a lot of impulsive activities so i can basically get that dopamine hit. i go on a lot of what i call “side quests” which are really just impulsive behaviors that i can no longer control. it usually makes the feelings of boredom go away for a couple days or so until i can act impulsively again or find a rabbit hole to fall down. this shows up in many aspects of my life that i hadn’t realized. i basically can’t sit still, and i have wondered for the longest time how people do so. if im at home playing a game i can only play it for a couple hours if im not borderline obsessed with it, im always trying to seek out new experiences, if i can’t travel for a while i get really depressed and daydream constantly about how things could be so much more fun and exciting in a different place. it leaves me wondering now, what am i truly searching for? i have changed so much during my life looking for satisfaction but i have yet to find it still. traveled across the world and i still get bored if im not actively doing something. i’ve almost always been a “thrill seeker” type of person within my limits. idk, i just need a second opinion, i dont see my psychologist for another week or so and im trying to figure this whole thing out basically by myself. also i apologize if a lot of this post doesn’t make sense. any feedback is appreciated.

I’ve been in therapy for anxiety, depression and adhd since I was 12 and been going to therapy at least once a month since/in and out of residential/iop treatment for an ed my whole life. I was deep diving last year learning about bpd because my mom has it and whilst learning about it I resonated with so much, mainly quiet bpd. Anyway fast forwarding to now my psychiatrist went pretty in depth with all the criteria and I hit all of it, I’ve been managing my symptoms the past 4 years but it’s like I feel like I’m a cup with a hole at the bottom and it’s being held together with a bandaid that’s leaking. I was getting really close to quitting my job I love and breaking up with my bf for no reason other than cause I felt like sabotaging my life pre psych appointment and it’s like I am just addicted to messing up my life and I’m constantly trying to keep myself from going off the rails but somehow not going off the rails cause I don’t want everyone around me to be disappointed and hate me. Anyways my psychiatrist said I have the bpd core but hasn’t told me anything else in terms of an official diagnosis and I’m kinda confused. I asked my therapist about it and she isn’t sure if I have it cause I’ve been doing ok the past 4 years but I feel like I’m good at hiding it and managing it since I’ve been in therapy for such a long time but idk… I just wanna share some of how I feel and see what y’all think, 
Ages 18-22 were me at my worst in terms of symptoms like reckless/dangerous behavior, hyper sexuality, substance abuse,rage episodes, self harm and straight up feeling manic but now I’ve had more of the following(now 27)
Never felt like I know who I am and like I’m just copying people around me in the moment to fit in, internal rage that I take out on myself, constant boredom like nothing makes me feel anything, history of trauma, feel like everything is a bigger deal than it is, I’m so terrified of friends leaving me that I just don’t have many anymore and tend to push friends away cause theyve always ended up leaving me, being hyper aware of others body language and over analyzing everything cause im like always looking for signs people hate me or are upset with me, feel like people hate me for no reason at all, do things to piss off my boyfriend to test if he’ll break up with me, horrible anxiety like lowkey paranoia, extreme perfectionist with my job cause I feel like if I mess up everything is over, constantly need reassurance and validation, feel like I constantly need to change how I look to keep people from seeing who I really am cause idk who that is, I just feel vacant inside like I had a personality and interests when I was a kid but I just don’t like anything anymore and feel like void of nothingness, constantly feeling worthless, all of my self esteem goes to my appearance/body/success, weird fear of being found out(idk even about what though like I’m just afraid of being exposed as a fraud, I feel things hard but numb out to protect myself or deny that things are happening, I feel like my emotions control me sometimes and I just get lost in my own head and emotions instead of rationalizing things, feel like a burden, feel like I my personality is fake and I’m exhausted whenever I’m around people cause I’m just acting however they expect me to act, go from loving everything to hating everything, my moods change sometimes every minute or hour over nothing ",1754957929.0,4,0,BPD,bpd
1mnylc9,How do you handle conflict in relationships when you instantly just want to break up?,"I have BPD (obviously) and struggle with idealization/devaluation. When things are good, they're great, but whenever I face conflict in my relationships, I instantly want to break up. When I calm down, I start to second guess that. 

It's hard because I genuinely think my partner and I aren't a good fit sometimes. We've been together almost 7 years, he's extremely patient with me, he's loving and sweet, but he's also an alcoholic/douchebag when he's drunk, and can be extremely selfish. I'm in the process of selling my condo and we're going to try to buy a house; we are going to get a prenup (because he is also financially irresponsible and has 25k to contribute to a downpayment while I have 100k and i'm not going to get screwed over and lose half of that if we break up). The prenup isn't the problem, but we got to the terms and I want partial custody of our dog to be included. He got the dog FOR ME in 2023, though he lives with my bf because he has a bigger place with a yard vs me in a 1 bdrm condo, it just makes more sense. Well, he's unwilling to consider that as a term and is saying it's ""his"" dog and it ""isn't a problem because we won't break up"". There are other smaller issues that I won't even get into rn. 

It SUCKS having BPD because on one hand I feel like I have a right to feel how I do, he's being a selfish prick and to not even let me have 2 days a week custody of our dog, do I really want to commit my entire life to someone like that? But again on the other hand, I know i'm upset and i'm probably not thinking completely clearly. I don't want to overreact and it sucks not being able to trust my own judgement.

1mnetpi,I feel so ugly,"I split on my fiance last night. He's cleaning out a room he's been using for storage so I can have a dedicated place for my new work from home job. He mentioned that his ex used to use that room, and I lost it. I have quiet BPD, so it wasn't a rage, more of a shut down. I now know her name and I looked her up on Facebook. She's beautiful. Skinny. I'm fat and ugly. I don't know why he says he wants me when he had someone like that. My heart hurts. How do I rein in my emotions? How do I stop thinking of this beautiful woman that used to be in his bed? I just want to gather all my things and leave. But I love him.

1mo278j,Advice for coping with a celebrity FP,"Back in April, an actor became like a favourite person to me. I say 'like' because I know some people don't think fps can be people you don't know, but regardless of whether that's what it is or not, I know its my BPD doing this, and I'm looking for help detaching.

It started with watching all the movies he'd been in, showing them to my friends and family, having the urge to talk about him with everyone, and getting into the things he was in to. It then evolved to watching interviews of him all day long, learning everything I could about him, and it turned into obsessive thoughts about whether I thought he would approve of certain things I did, said, wore, etc. and acting more like him or his movie characters, even picking up some of his mannerisms. In watching basically everything he has ever said publicly, I stumble across some things that made me uncomfortable. Nothing too bad, but because its him, it affects me a lot. It may also be important to note that I have pretty severe OCD and fixate heavily on morality, and have strong emotions for many taboo topics that are covered in movies he's been in. Needless to say, these things really affected me, even leading to me relapsing (which I have admittedly found very embarrassing lol), and I am currently in a major depressive episode which I believe was heavily influenced by this. There is no proof that he is the kind of person i fear he might be. He hasn't had any major scandals and everyone says he’s a good guy, but I can't help but feel like I should assume the worst since he's a famous man.

I do enjoy his work and want to continue to follow it, I just want to find a balance so it doesn't continue to control my life. I am very aware that i have no connection to him at all, and that he is just some random guy I happened across, but I can't help but feel these strong emotions.",1754983717.0,1,2,BPD,bpd

1mnma42,How to deal with the need to be the best they've ever had (sexually),"How do I let go of the thoughts that tell me if my boyfriend and I had a threesome, he would be more attracted to the other girl? I have these thoughts and thoughts related to him thinking about the other girls he has been with right after sex and its becoming so draining and heartbreaking.

I journal and use CBT prompts to help view this in a different light but it is hard becasue I know that biologically men want what they want and I can't change so theres always going to be someone he is more sexually attracted to. He makes me feel beautiful but since I was 13 I've only felt wanted by guys for my body. Since then I feel like my self worth is in how fuckable I am. So these thoughts really take a toll on me and my reltionship. I spilt on my partner from these thoughts that pop in my head and am convinced that there is someone else he would rather have sex with, someone he has had sex with that is better than me/better than our sex etc.  He is loving and doesn't say or do anything to suggest any of my thoughts are true. He gives me reassurance but I feel like this way of thinking is engraved deeply in my brain- I want that to change

I have apologized but ever since then, I haven't been invited over again. She doesn't text me as often as she used to and she also never asks me to hangout anymore.

1mntooy,When do i walk away from something?,"After a recent confrontation with someone I consider my best friend who told me we 'aren't best friends anymore,' I'm really having a hard time figuring out when it's OK to walk away from a relationship that my BPD has repeatedly affected negatively. 

Without splitting hairs and weighing scales, I know me and this person, R, have both hurt each other a lot in the past, and I know for the past year or so I have been the primary 'bad guy.' But as soon as R starts railing into me about how I've hurt them, I can't help but either lash out or just go totally numb and almost ask to be hurt to even things out. I once again tried to say in our latest confrontation, I think I really should walk away from this relationship because I seem to hurt you a lot and I don't think I can be fair about this. I realized and then explained I think they've been my FP for the past five or so years and small reactions from them feel so much bigger than huge reactions from other people. They told me they didn't ask to be obsessed over, but also that it isn't fair I'd rather walk away than work things out. 

This is so frustrating because if I could work it out, I would. If I knew how to stop taking small things from them personally, I would. If I knew how to stop feeling like they hate me, I would do that. If I feel like other people in my life are upset with me, it's so different than how it feels when I'm out of R's favor. I feel out of control and insane and I just want to walk away. I understand they're upset with me for hurting them and I'm trying to own it, but I'm just stuck in this spiral of 'Why do you hate me? If you hate me why are you talking to me? It would feel safer if you just said you hate me. Why are you keeping me here? This feels like a punishment."" 

Hass anyone ever broken that FP bond? I would love to be normal friends again with R and start from the bottom, but I just can't seem to. And walking away is also not allowed, apparently, because then I'm abandoning them. I'm so lost. I just want to stop having these feelings. ",1754957342.0,2,1,BPD,bpd

I've been through countless talk therapies, but nothing has changed, if anything it has just gotten worse, however i think subconsciously and unconsciously i was probably manipulating them or playing the victim instead of truly trying to change. For the first time in my life i am booked into seeing a psychiatrist after years of denial and harm. This is my rock bottom.

I feel disheartened because a lot of my research has pointed me to narcissist can never change and that there is no hope for long lasting change. i feel constantly empty inside, completely isolated and have no idea how to socialize or be present with people. i just end up talking about myself and my problems. This too has cause more introversion/antisocial aspects because i just don't want to cause anymore hurt or harm. Also because people stay away from me because I'm in victim mode 24/7. I cannot see outside of myself, i cannot see other people's perspectives, i have very little to no empathy, understanding or genuine care. i have left a very destructive relational path with women and that has been the hardest thing to face because deep down i just want to be loved however i have no idea how to or genuinely understand the other person and their wants and needs.

I really don't know what to do i feel so lost, so hopeless, so alone and i want to try and change so i can become someone present, grounded, trustworthy and honest. so hopefully i can build healthy relationships one day based on mutual respect and reciprocity and so it isn't all take from my side and i can give back. i know my behavior needs to change however sometimes i cannot even see it or how my actions affect other people, it's like I'm completely blind to it.

If anyone has any advice on where to start, what type of therapies i should be looking to do or help i should try and get. that would be greatly appreciated. I'd also like to hear anyone else's stories and hopefully utilize this platform as a way to connect so i don't feel so isolated and alone anymore.

Thank you for your time.",1754969963.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mnpu3b,It’s so hard trying not to self-sabotage in a relationship,"I wish I could have my partner all to myself. I wish he was like those bfs in memes where they are cold towards other women who are in their radius. But alas, he’s so kind to the world and I can’t relate. I don’t think these people will matter in 10 years and I’m picky with my time. I can’t imagine caring about what other people are up to on social media and hate going through their stories.

I have crazy retroactive jealousy and I can’t even stand the thought of him having more fun playing games with his own best friend whom he’s known much longer than me. I wish I could be everything that he wanted.

He’s very patient and does his best to reassure me. But no matter what he says it just won’t register in my brain. Nobody will ever understand how hard it is to fight these crippling thoughts alone without blowing up on innocent bystanders.

I don’t think I deserve such kindness. I hate myself and I feel like my existence is a nuisance. I’m nowhere near as good looking, talented, charming, intelligent, well-spoken as he is. It doesn’t make any sense for him to settle for me. I stutter, my sentences don’t make any sense and I lack any charm whatsoever. I’m really slow, i can only do decent art and that’s it. I’m not good in academics, I’m not even street smart. The only thing I’ve got going for me is I’m the understanding therapist friend but that’s it. I don’t have any qualities he could be proud of. 

These feelings manifest in me having random urges to break up with him so he could be free to date other women who are much better suited for him that’s in his league. 

TLDR; i’m blackpilled and want to prove to my partner that i’m unworthy of being loved by self sabotaging because i think he’s too good for me",1754947813.0,1,1,BPD,bpd

1mnp2v9,out of psych ward,"hey

I got released from the psych ward 2 weeks ago and everything feels so weird. I got diagnosed with BPD and I did discuss this beforehand with my therapist at home, but having it said to my face, officially, that what I feel is valid and real. I can't seem to adjust here though. Nothing feels real, I dissociate so often, and to make matters worse my therapist is on holiday for the rest of August. 

I feel disconnected, I am constantly exhausted and also back to work, which makes it feel a bit better since I can take my mind off of things. My head is a mess, and I'm trying really hard not to relapse even though I am so so tempted. I now know what I have, but my therapy for the real thing hasn't started yet.

 Unfortunately they didn't get me on any antidepressants and they said it probably won't be possible to do it if I'm not stationary because the risk is too high. 

I am so overwhelmed with everything. My parents, work even though I love it, the friends I dont have but so so want to have, and I just wanna feel okay but it doesn't seem to be possible. When I don't work, I bed rot. I don't live, I exist. I see other people living their lives to the fullest, knowing I wont have that for a while because of my anxiety and ocd/autism-traits.
(Theyre traits, I do not have either, but I do have ADHD) 

I feel so lost and lonely and desperate. Nothing feels permanent, I feel empty but at the same time I feel like I might break down at such minor things. I don't know what to do. ",1754946102.0,3,1,BPD,bpd

my boyfriend went to a concert a while ago. i didn’t go because it was a sort of tradition between him and the people he was going with, and there also wasn’t enough room in the car. okay whatever i was fine with that (kinda) but i didn’t really know the band so it wasn’t that bad for me to sit this out. but i think that when he was there, he either bought a pre-signed cd or he got to meet the band and they signed it for him. when he got home he didn’t mention this at all and it’s been months since, and i just found the cd when i was cleaning. i think he might have not mentioned it to me because he knew i already had a little bit of fomo to begin with and didn’t want to make it worse by saying he got to meet the band, but i just feel not great now and idk how to feel about this. am i stupid for feeling lied to?

1mnj2kx,How to heal when having A FP (friend) is really hard to heal and have a more normal friendship?,"im a 30 something year old recently struggling again with people close to me and a new ""FP"" that i only now know as that... dynamic. That has started in my life regrettably as the previous 2 or 3 were something I thought I simply got over. But long periods of refusing to socialize and trying to get into self help /development and I thought It wouldn't happen again.



So this is a bit hard. but In the last 15 years I've had various ""FP"" attachments, I had a horrible childhood with abusive/neglectful and alcoholic parents and became ill with an eating disorder and I stopped making new friends, I stopped doing anything much but cope by playing video games and having online friends besides the few best friends.

I dont think i really had a FP untill I was in my early 20's. It got worse the more isolated I became since i found some refuge with people online that i wasn't meeting irl. And I eventually was admitted to the hospital and asked for help for the first time at 24 after like 18 years of being through hell. 

as girl that likes girls i would usually fall for very emotionally unavailable women that were very empathethic or charming aswell. 

i would feel good for the first time in so long but usually it would be impossible or long distance and it would just start out as friendships because I thought i would get hurt anyway If I opened up about romantic feelings.

I realized after over 10 years in psychiatry treatment where they thought I had schizotypal or schizophrenia unspecified that I actually have symptoms of borderline. mainly quiet borderline.

I met another person recently. A woman my age, and that I started to idealize without really knowing what I was doing. It wasn't untill I had build up a fantasy that kind of shattered that I realized it was an illusion. complete agony that maybe they arent perfect and they dont like you the way you like them.


this person was amazing on her own, but didnt feel or think the things I thought in my head, I played into my own fantasy and didnt realize I was still sort of not realistic. 

I felt so much dread. Reality felt like shit. But i didnt want to lose her. I'd become so attached and tried my best to find out why I felt like that, diving into different topics hoping to heal and feel normal.  

I realized now that I have issues, and I had to put myself first. But I struggled with self love and identity for so long, that I suck so much at it. I felt great only when I had somebody else to help / love and focus on, and that they somehow were interested in me, which meant that I felt good about myself and wanted / safe.

I wish I could help love and focus on myself. I wish I could not have emotion swings all the time, and not feel sick. FP just means so much to me, and when i dont hear from her, I think im unworthy and that i dont matter, to the point im getting scared of being simply left. 

It's been a struggle to be a good person, to treat her well, and respect all her boundaries, and not let her deal with my emotions. 

as I can't see her very often and she would be overwhelmed If I called her much, or texted often.

I think she just genuinely likes me and wants to help me as she realizes I have some issues. Its a good person and therefore I want to be healthy for myself and people i meet in my life, so that I don't have to emotionally unstable / bad all the time, so that I don't put pressure on my friend. So that I can actually start having meaningful ppl in my life without fucking it up. 

If anybody has any ideas? I am going to try find a therapist soon and try more DBT. I have been very interested in healing trauma for a long time, that's what I thought caused my intense attachment issue, (wanting like a stable parent like figure in my life) due to lack of reliance and joy in my own identity. 

I try to work on a few small goals and try and improve my sense of self.

 I feel a bit like drowning sometimes, Drowning in isolation and darkness sometimes where I just feel like fighting for just me is so pointless and I just wish I could go and work on somebody elses life. Like hers, and make myself needed, at least thats better than not being needed that often and struggling to be alone. 

Also the greyness and boringness of not hanging out with her for so long, it hurt so much, I tried my best to find the best possible replacement to avoid the pain, and spent a lot of time just socializing to try and distract myself it seems. 

Realizing that she isnt that perfect that and life is dull and goes on... well, that's just so intensely boring. I am scared that the more time passed and the more i learned to simply survive the long times between talking that if I healed from this, and she was more like my other not so close friendships, that life would simply not be worth it, if everything becomes dull and grey. like it used to be. 

However the strength in my own self and self love would also make me a lot stronger and capable of true love and support both to her and my family and future potential partners So it seems like the logical way to be. I never really felt whole enough to even attempt a proper long term relationship after my first one broke apart.

i do feel empty. so I guess I hope that i could heal and feel good alone, and have a relationship one day based on love and not attachment and scary emotions. I think it would feel boring too though and it makes me scared. 

i hope somewhere out there can relate at all and offer some tips to try and move towards healthier where I am feeling okay about just beign with me.

i really hope it made sense at all and somebody out there can relate. maybe even somebody has some advice. :( I know that the solution isn't to find another FP with more time, as it would simply end in trouble again. I wish i didnt have a need for them. and i didnt feel so intensely happy with certain people i meet and this insane chemistry.",1754932658.0,5,0,BPD,bpd
1mnw5u2,How I (37M) Healed: My Journey,"Want to start this by saying that I've lurked on this subreddit for a while and observed other people's stories. I am forever grateful for this sub for being able to look inwardly at my own issues and how I've been affected, and how others around me have been affected by my trauma. NSFW warning, I've known something has been wrong with me since my youth but could never really gauge it. Physical, emotional, sexual abuse as a young boy colored my perspective on life for a long time and never could quite work through it. This certainly wasn't helped by my own family who refused to believe anything was wrong with me and I was refused access to mental health services in my youth. It wasn't until about 6 years ago that I was able to even seek mental health treatment, and in truth, I don't think I was being honest with my therapist at the time. Mostly because I wasn't being truthful with myself. The BPD was obvious to my first therapist, but I internalized too much out of fear, anger toward others and my violent mood swings. It's one of my biggest regrets not being fully truthful with my first therapist, who genuinely was trying to help me. I just couldn't let go of what was not within my own control.

Turned to substance and alcohol abuse by the time I was in high school just to cope with all the myriad of issues, for a long time. Issues compounded in many ways but I was never able to meaningfully form relationships as a result of those challenges. I increasingly became disconnected from others. Other major traumas compounded in my adult life: my then wife and I had a daughter who passed away as an infant. She and I never could get back on track after that, and the drug and alcohol abuse got even worse. I spiraled further down, and after being witness to my best friend in the world (and one of the only people who ever really understood me), taking his own life, I hit rock bottom. Funny that, I was always able to mask all of this by laser-focusing on my work. I was able to stay afloat by simply just existing in the knowledge that I am a rockstar at my work and it gave me some degree of purpose. 

Sadly, that also blew up in my face. I finally snapped and it all went off the deep end. Due to the combination of issues - my mental health, letting my physical health decline as a result, the substance and alcohol abuse issues I lived with for years. Working myself to the point of exhaustion just to stay afloat financially. It all culminated in a stroke two weeks before my birthday last year. I recoiled at what had happened and tried to make sense of it all.

But somehow, that also turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Since that time, I was fortunate enough to finally get answers that had never come through years of therapy. I was able to finally be truthful with myself, (and with my therapist as a result), and I could look objectively at what I had to do to see a better day. Saw my own value again for the first time, motivated me. And then vitamin deficiencies I had lived with for years that I never could find out (lack of access to healthcare for years), I was able to really get a holistic handle on my own health, mentally and physically. The brain fog finally lifted. As it happens, I had critical vitamin deficiencies I never knew about. That, and an underperforming thyroid, all exacerbated by my vices I had turned to as a younger man just to make it through the day, culminating in a stroke somehow has lifted me further than I ever could previously go.

The brain fog going away and that near death experience somehow lifted me to new heights I'd never thought possible. I was able to finally stop internalizing these thoughts, these feelings. All my past thoughts of suicide and internalizing everything because of my own experiences, on some level, I really think my old self died in that hospital room that night. But despite that, it's given me a renewed sense of purpose. Combined with the fact that the saying ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"", I now absolutely believe that - I walked away from that stroke with no permanent brain damage and a better outlook on the future. I've forgiven and chose to put behind me that which is not within my control, and it's helped me better understand being empathetic toward others who suffer more than I ever did in the past.

And now, my hope for a better day that pushed me to not take my own life despite my own trauma, finally came true. And this sub has helped me greatly understanding others personal experiences - and for that, I must thank all of you who have shared your own stories, and I hope in some way that maybe this could help others. I value all of you and this community.

1mntjk4,any advice?,"I want to preface this with I have not been diagnosed with BPD (please delete my post if I’m being disrespectful), but I strongly relate to some of the symptoms.

When I have a crush on someone, I idolise them. They become the most amazing, important person to me, and my life starts to honestly revolve around making them happy and never disappointing them. I can’t stop thinking about them and then how they hate me or abandon me.. even when I should be thinking about my degree, my job, or literally anything else. At one point it even extended to my entire former friend group. I’d see them as the perfect family rather than just people, and then I’d get paranoid that they were going to abandon me when they just needed space or didn’t talk to me enough. 

Then it was like the switch completely flipped. Everyone just became monsters trying to hurt or attack me and I felt like the only way to make it through was to fight everyone around me, to show them that if they hurt me, they’ll get hurt so badly they’ll never be able to hurt me again.

I’ve been a genuinely horrible friend and person, just burning down the people around me and I just regret it all. Ive seriously hurt everyone I’ve loved and I don’t deserve or want forgiveness. 

I went to therapy for a while (about a year until all my free sessions ran out haha) mostly for my depression and anxiety, and learned how to cope with the loss of all my friends, and I’m a lot less suicidal and depressed. I believed I could do better, make new friends, get a job, survive and keep going.

But I’m afraid because I can feel the same feelings I had before towards a new friend I’ve got a crush on. I can feel this irrational obsession growing, I think about him so much, more than I’m actually seeing him, and I feel as though I’m crushing on a guy I don’t really know very well? As in the feelings are so intense, for someone I realistically don’t know that much about. 

I’m honestly terrified of how I feel. I don’t want these feelings, although I can’t deny that without the obsession, my heart feels terribly empty. It feels good to think about someone all the time but I have to push the thoughts out if my head because it’s ridiculous and I am very much not capable of loving another person.

at the very least I don’t want to hurt the guy or flip on him like I have with others in the past. I’m not too sure if it’s the exact same thing as having a favourite person, but I think it’s similar enough to ask for advice from you all.

How do I cope with these feelings I have for my friend? In general how do you stop idealising people and then changing your view completely when you feel like someone is going to abandon you or hates you? 

Thanks in advance

1mnthcd,I’m at a loss.,"I have spent a lot of time self reflecting on my actions, my feelings. But by the end of it I’m confused and not sure who to point the finger at. or if it was all my fault. 

For context, I show up a lot in friendships and relationships, and when there’s an inconsistency or if they also have disordered behavior towards me. I’ve had people try to manipulate me on purpose by gaslighting or guilt tripping me and to combat this I disengage and I leave. It’s not me ghosting them or breadcrumbing them, I’m just genuinely disinterested in talking to them all together. But I’m seen as the bad guy for it(?) and get the blame for not being consistent and putting up with it enough. Sometimes I’m just distant because I’m invested in the things I have going on for myself and it has nothing to do with the other person- I tell them that- and yet they take it personally and try to punish me by breadcrumbing me back anyway. When I ask if things are okay, they lie about it. But snoop around and invade my boundaries and get mad when I react negatively to that also. 
I’ve read a ton of posts where people have been extremely angry at their friends and loved ones for leaving , how their life is so much better without them anyway and I wonder if people feel that way about me sometimes. But I don’t leave to be evil. I just don’t want to be hurt or confused anymore. I just want them to stop lying to me.


I try to mirror people so that they can feel safe with me because my personality is too complex. I was taught that no one can handle me. That I ask for too much. And when I don’t fit the bill of what they wanted I feel like I get punished for it and discarded all the time. Or even worse, they copy me and take parts of me they demonized for themselves leaving me with a lack of self. I have no idea how I’m supposed to show up in the world. I feel like I’m shattered into a million different pieces just to survive, just to get along. and I’m the only one that can or will want to efficiently protect myself while also having to manage the feelings of other people. 
I’ve fought long and hard to be strong for myself and the people I love, but I’m learning that kindness and being giving only gets me used. After failing so many times, I’ve lost interest in everything. Friends, lovers, people, hobbies. Just the day to day. Alcohol makes me feel better but I don’t want to be addicted.

1mnt1v5,Impulsivity is my biggest down fall,"Well, here we are once again I have made some very impulsive decisions. Most of these decisions are based around me being under the influence of alcohol and now I’m starting to think that I might actually have to become fully sober. And I slept with two separate people this weekend under the influence of alcohol. Now I’m rotting in my house and had to take a mental health day today to deal with my fucking bullshit. 

I am still trying so hard to work through my fucking problems, but I’m so sick of my own shit. I’m so tired of making poor choices impulsively because what?  And one of the individuals actually likes me, but I actually don’t like them that way so now I have to be an asshole and just fucking black-and-white this shit like no it’s not happening ever sorry. Like how do you stop making such crazy impulsive decisions like what? What do I do? When I probably have to either stop drinking altogether or cut back like for a month or several months. It’s just been a lot. I’ve been making some really fucked up decisions in the last month. And then I get really depressed because I’m like why am I doing this to myself like I am my own worst enemy. And this is probably the only place I can come to vent about these things other than using you know ChatGPT you temporarily until I see my therapist.

But I’m also starting to get the feeling that I am too much to handle from my own therapist because I’m repeating cycles of impulsivity and substance abuse and then going back to trying to live my normal life with my normal job acting like I didn’t just do a bunch of crazy shit This weekend.

It’s so exhausting and I feel like I need to just like stay home and do nothing like I need to not even have friends or be around people or talk to other people in search of sex or whatever.

1mn30wy,Does anyone become fixated on fictional movie/tv characters?,"I’ve been reading about identity diffusion in bpd and was wondering if anyone else has this same experience.

I become weirdly fixated on tv and movie characters. Like let’s say for instance I’ll start a new tv show and find a specific character really cool. I will then proceed to change myself in line with that character. I’ll dye/bleach my hair, buy a ton of new clothes and accessories to match that characters “aesthetic” and even change the music I listen to, the mindset I have or way I act. Then after a while I’ll get over it or find a new character to obsess over and I find that I’m longer into that “aesthetic” despite spending a ton of money on it and practically trying to be that character. 

It happens with celebrities too. It’s a weird feeling almost like I’m convinced I’ve finally found my “style” or my “image” only to drop it months later. 

I always thought this was normal until I realised how rigid I was about it and how I felt weirdly high during the mirroring (idk what else to call it).

Support/advice is also welcome… also hoping that I am not writing about you!!!!!

Started dating one of my closest friends whom I love very much and seriously made me think that I am capable of love, and I funnily enough have started experiencing so much emotional instability since starting dating them (mostly due to unresolved problems I already had before), and have done and not done things that prompted each of us to become more distant.

1mnp1i4,Medical Issues and Extreme Paranoia/Emotions,"

Hello, I (21 m) was diagnosed with BPD in June of 2024 and since December of 2024 have had serious medical issues going on. I got very sick in December and since then have had an ever growing list of very concerning symptoms that are worsening and multiplying. I will give a few symptoms just so you all can understand why I am feeling so worried and having such a problem right now. Some symptoms include: 

- Confusion 
- Loosing balance
- Unintentional extreme weight loss (December: 260, today: 180)
- Muscle deterioration 
- Memory Loss 
- fatigued 24/7
- Vomiting weekly
- Nausea daily
-  Loss of appetite 
- Unable to sleep (previous problems with insomnia though)

Those are just some of the big ones, but as you can see, very extreme stuff. I failed out of college because of all of this and was almost homeless because I had nowhere to go when I left my college dorm. I had been a mess since February when my girlfriend finally made me go to the doctor and that is when all of this medical testing started. I am getting all of these test done by a million doctors but I am getting worse both physically and mentally. I finally decided to get on here today to talk to some people hopefully with BPD and get some help or just relief because I have nobody to go to about these extreme emotions except my therapist. 

I am constantly irritated, constantly worried. I work a lot too and that has played a part in it as well. I recently became manager in June of a local dive bar and adding that level of stress on top of everything else has made me just ready to snap and I don’t want to because I can’t afford to do it right now. I work in the food industry and it’s getting to the point where the thought of going to work makes me want to bash my head in. By the time I get home I am in so much pain and so upset that I can’t enjoy my evenings with my girlfriend or my dog. I try to mask my pain for her because she is a literal saint and has been nothing but patient with me but its getting harder to do. I feel like life has done nothing but fuck me over and I am so sick of it. Im just angry at the world and what the past year of my life has turned into. 

I have long struggled with my identity and sense of self, and after getting out of a long and toxic relationship I worked really hard to become the version of myself I wanted to be, without the input of anyone else. Now I feel like it all got taken away from me because of this medical stuff. None of my clothes fit me, I look like I am wearing my father’s clothes. When I look in the mirror I don’t know who it is anymore. I am NOT a crying person, now I cry at least once a day. I am constantly worried about loosing everything again, so I work over time every week even though my body is LITERALLY deteriorating. I sleep with the sound of grown men screaming in my ears, its the most terrifying cry of desperation you have ever heard. It sounds like grown men are screaming out as they are being awfully tore apart by a bear or something. I am constantly rechecking myself over and over again. My girlfriend has to talk me out of going back to work to “double check” that I locked up the bar even though she saw me do it and I live over 30 mins away. She also pokes fun at me for how much I recount my cash and recheck my bank because I am always convinced I have no money. I am convinced that at any moment the cops are going to show up and rip me out of my apartment (for what? Nothing. I have no reason to believe that.) I wake up every morning with the notion that I will roll over and see I lost my job ( I am literally the glue holding that place together.) I am worried that at any moment I am just going to have this horrible pain somewhere in my body, fall to the ground, and just die because we are no where close to finding out what is wrong with me. I couldn’t even remember what side of the road to drive on last month. It’s all so scary and it’s making all my emotions a million times more intense. 

They took me off all my antidepressants and anti anxiety meds back in February of 2025  for a fear of serotonin syndrome. But further bloodwork proved that was not the problem so I am running on messed up medications as well. I am working with my psychiatrist to get me back to normal medication wise but it’s taking its sweet time. 

I know this is such a whirlwind of an experience to go through and so I am guessing many of you have not had this exact experience but any similar stories would be greatly appreciated. Any advice at all on how to deal with all of this? I try to talk to myself with reason and I self soothe a lot but it’s getting less and less effective as time goes on. I talk through my emotions as they come and I try to stay aware of my limits and try to not push myself beyond them but life sometimes does that for you. For example, last week I had a full-blown panic attack in the back alley of my job and I can feel them coming more and more frequently. Any advice at all is helpful. I apologize if this is all over the place or confusing my brain does not function properly anymore so my thoughts are scattered. Thank you for reading and your thoughts and advice!

1mndoly,I think I just lost my fp,"I met this girl one year ago and after some time she became my “favourite person”. At first we used to call each other babe and stuff (but not in a romantic way) and she was just different for me. We’ll be on calls for hours until we fall asleep and video call from time to time and she’s basically the no1 in my heart. But the catch is, there’s this other girl who she knows for a very long time already and it’s obvious that that girl is her no1 (and she admitted it herself) and I cannot say I don’t mind that at all cuz all this time I know that I’m not her no1 and in my heart I try to not put her on my no1 spot just because she didn’t put me back, but I know that I don’t have anyone else who puts me on their no1 spot too just so I can put them on my no1 spot, if that makes sense. I feel like I was pretty controlling of her and I don’t like it when she’s like super close to people who I don’t like(cuz they did me wrong), but I try to not say it out loud because it’ll make me seem super petty.  Every time we fight I give her the silent treatment because I really just don’t know what to react and I literally just can’t speak even when I want to explain my point of view. I feel like I keep pushing her away from me just because of how borderline Iam. A few days ago we had another fight in which we both did something wrong. She apologised but reading her message I feel like she’s already tired of me and I think I’m loosing her already.

1mnmiuk,Splitting time,"Hi everyone, I hope you're doing well.

This is my first post here.I'm going through a very difficult time I believe this community might be able to help me with some guidance and support.

My girlfriend was diagnosed with BPD this January, after a séries of evaluations conducted at the end of last year.

After our first year living together, she began experiencing intense anger episodes and frequently expressed a deep fear of abandonment.Because of this, we decided to seek help to better understand what was going on.

She had already been attending biweekly therapy sessions before the diagnosis and continues to do so, but unfortunately, nothing has been specifically focused on treating BPD.Even after the diagnosis, there hasn't been a significant change in her therapeutic approach.

Since then, I've changed the way I handle conflicts, trying to open space for calm discussions and avoid arguments.The more intense fights have decreased, but over the past three months, I've noticed that almost everything I say is being misinterpreted as criticism or offense even when that's not my intention at all

Then, eleven days ago, I came home from work and found her parents.She broke up with me, saying that small disagreement we had the night before was the final straw again, a situation where everything I said was distorted and taken as criticism.

Over the past few months, I've been fully dedicated to our relationship trying to be a better partner, more attentive, loving, and romantic. But sadly, she hasn't  been able to see that and still doesn't.

We bought an apartment that's scheduled to be ready in December, along with the furniture.We were in the process of choosing the finishing touches.Not even this shared life project was enough for her to stay.

Since the breakup,we're barely spoken.On about seven of those eleven days, she said things like ""I love you,"" "" I miss you"", ""I think about you all the time"".But she also emphasized that she needs time to think things through, without setting a deadline.She said that after this período,we'll talk ans decide whether to end things for good or try again.

Yesterday,she asked me not to send affectionate messages and said she's not ready to talk not even by text during this time

While researching BPD, I came across the concept ""Splitting"" which seems to perfectly describe, what I'm experiencing.It feels like she's unable to weigh both the good and the bad, or everything we've built together.It's she only sees the negative and can't let go of past arguments.

Has anyone here gone through a splitting phase with a partner? Could you please explain how its works, how long it usually lasts, and what I'm supposed to do during this time ?

Honestly, being in our home alone, surrounded by all our memories while she's thinking things over, has been incredibly painful. ",1754940319.0,1,1,BPD,bpd

1mnk6d1,Stormed off during an emergency having a meltdown,"
I have a family friend who I consider my family, she’s in her 80’s and I’ve known her for about 5 years now through me walking her dogs. 

I went to the vet today with her, my mum (who’s her ‘best friend’), and her dog for a checkup. 

As we were leaving, she collapsed and wouldn’t wake up. I had to run up to someone in the waiting room (who’d witnessed all this btw) and force him to call an ambulance. 

After this, some receptionists and vets came out to ‘attempt to help’ whilst standing staring. 

An ambulance would have taken 2 hours to arrive. At this point, she was on the floor convulsing and staring into space unresponsive. I was 100% convinced she was going to die. 

The ambulance service was on speaker phone with the receptionist, and asking questions so I tried to intervene to get across the seriousness bc this receptionist wasn’t really explaining anything.

She told me to be quiet. At this point I started shouting, I’ll admit. I told her not to tell me what to fucking do, the other vets started getting funny with me. 

They were all umming and ahhing whilst staring at her on the floor, and I’d had enough. I asked my mum what we were going to do, and she said we’d take her to A&E to be triaged. Which obviously it’s a bit late for that. 

I told her, ‘I watched someone die in an A&E waiting room, we can’t just hope for the best and take her there’.

Another receptionist got angry with me and put her fingers to her lips like I’m a fucking toddler and told me ‘be careful what you say in front of her.’

Bare in mind this woman is unresponsive on the floor, not even blinking. I screamed at her ‘fuck you’ and fuck you all and stormed off. 

I’ve been sat on a patch of grass on a farm area for 2 hours sh ing. My mum has threatened to call the police on me if I don’t go home. 

The friend is ok, couldn’t be seen by anyone so she’s waiting for a doctor’s appointment bc she’s awake and responsive now. 

The whole time I knew I’d regret it, I felt sick and my heart has been pounding, like I’m going to faint. The euphoria I got from shouting and swearing was like nothing else. 

I kept telling myself this wasn’t a normal reaction, but everything in me feels like it was. 2 of the receptionists were fucking making little jokes and chuckling about something during it and it’s wound me up beyond belief. 

Originally I was going to lie down in the road but I thought better of it very quickly and decided to sit here and do this. I don’t want to leave.

We’ve broken up probably a hundred times in the span of our relationship and we always come back together in the end because that’s just our cycle. He’s avoidantly attached and I’m anxiously attached and I also have quiet BPD so yeah we are a toxic ball of shit. 
But the past year or more he’s been going through some really hard times. I have tried to help and support him as much as I can but over time I’ve noticed that I am adding far more stress to his life than anything else. I’ve actually known that for a while. And despite me making some major improvements in my mental health, I know I am a burden on him. So I have decided to end things. And I am devastated. I’ve spent the last two days crying about it before finally sending that text tonight. 
I know it’s gonna be hard and it always feels like withdrawals when we break up but this time somehow I’m going to have to push through it because in the end I know what I’m doing is the best thing for him. This just really really sucks. 
I guess I’m seeking advice on how you guys cope with breakups of this magnitude? I’ve had breakups before but I have never loved anyone like I love him. I’ve had other FP’s before and other attachments, but not like this. I’m just so lost but I have to stick it out. I’m only making his life miserable and that’s not fair to him.

1mn73e4,I just need someone to relate to me.,"Most people I've become friends with have started being mean to me or replaced me. Now I'm scared of any type of connection. When somebody new comes up to me, I get very paranoid and angry and I just want them to leave me alone. Being around people makes me feel alienated and paranoid and triggers my mood instability. I have a mix of petulant and quiet, so I get very angry and I'm quick to blame others, but I only show it in a private space because I've never been allowed to be angry.

For the people I AM friends with, I can be very affectionate with them, I get angry if they're closer to someone than me and I get scared of them being angry at me and forgetting me if I'm not fully being paid attention to.

Being alone is much more enjoyable for me. There's nobody around to hurt or leave me and I can show my emotions without being yelled at. There isn't anybody to piss me off or make me feel invalidated. I'm just becoming very hyper-independent. Since I also have PPD, I trust myself much more than other people.

I want to be gentle and kind, because I know that's what I truly am, but people just make it so hard.",1754899509.0,5,6,BPD,bpd

1mngw5w,First Time Dealing with Romantic Insecurities,"Hey, here. This is my first time posting anything on here. I've always been a bit shy to reach out, but a lot of what is said here on r/BPD has helped me navigate things. I've been recently diagnosed (like literally a month ago), but I don't have access to any therapy, so I go off of vibes and the support friends with BPD and bipolarity offer. And, after my diagnosis, I have come here. It's been cool to see that there are people that experience things the same way I do and react to/interact with life the same way I inadvertently do, too. I'm getting off topic here, ugh, I apologise.  
The issue I'm here to ask about: I have recently become romantically involved with somebody - my first true romantic experience - and while it's been a beautiful and wonderful journey, as we continue to develop our relationship, I'm spiraling more and more often, and it's been taking over my thoughts: 'did I say that thing right?'; 'was that thing I said nice?'; 'does he hate me now that I've said that one thing?'; 'how can he care for me if I'm so messed up?'; 'is he not sick of hearing my anxieties and dealing with it?'. He's said time and again that he cares for me and he's here to support me (assuring me that he understands that I struggle with these very anxieties, and that it won't deter him from being with me), but I don't want that as a substantiation to just continuing the cycle of anxiety. I also consistently feel like he's going to leave me and that those words of support and affirmation hold no truth. I feel very alone and untethered.  
I'm here to ask if anybody can offer assistance. How can I approach these anxieties constructively to exercise diffusion. I want to trust him; moreover I want to trust me, but I don't know how. Any advice? Further, is there any advice that can be given about how to navigate my BPD independently? A psychologist I had in the past (back when I had access to therapy) spoke about practicing DBT, and I've heard people on here speak about it, too, but I don't really know what it is/how to apply it. I kind of feel very isolated and confused (and I'm tired of asking ChatGPT for support and advice).",1754927934.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mng516,Girlfriend pulled away after argument – feelings or just politeness?,"I (male, early 30s) have been dating my girlfriend (Ela,diagnosed with bpd and depression six montha ago, late 20s) for a few weeks. About two weeks ago, we had our first big argument. Afterwards, she told me she needed space, and I respected that.

During that time, she reached out twice on her own, but it was just small talk. We then met up once to “clear the air.” During that conversation, she expressed doubts multiple times about whether it made sense to continue if things were already “starting off badly.” After a long talk, we cleared up all misunderstandings and agreed to check in after the weekend to clearly decide where we stand.

When we texted after the weekend, she said she needed more time. I suggested we meet casually and have fun without talking about relationship issues – she declined two days in a row.

A few days later, we ran into each other at the gym. She just gave me a quick wave and walked on without saying a proper hello. Later she told me she was surprised and didn’t know how to act since we hadn’t seen each other for a few days.

Now I’m unsure whether her behavior means:

She still has feelings but is scared of getting hurt,
or

She doesn’t have feelings anymore and is just being polite.",1754926293.0,0,0,BPD,bpd
1mn3tgf,Anybody else feel lonely when they’re doing well?,"I’ve worked so hard to find peace and happiness after my BPD diagnosis. I have a routine. I’ve lost over 80 pounds after kicking my drinking habit. I have a beautiful apartment in a big city that I can easily afford when I budget correctly, and am responsible with my paycheck. My full time job is at a concert venue and I make my living putting on shows. I get paid very well and sometimes I have to pinch myself to remind me this is my full time job and that I’m GOOD at it. I have a lot of incredible friends. I have a dog who is quite literally my entire world and I would never ever go off the deep end because of him. He’s saved me in more ways than I could ever say. 

My life is so good. It’s so good because of the exhausting work I have put in to stabilize myself; but I’m so lonely. I feel stable and SO alone. I really thought once I found my rhythm I’d be able to find a partner, but it just hasn’t panned out. I think I’m pretty. I’m not in bad shape, but I’m 5’10” as a woman and I really think that hinders guys approaching me and it makes me feel horrible about myself. Like I’m a monster nobody could ever love because I’m too big no matter my fitness level.

Does anybody else acknowledge that they’re doing well, their life is good, but just can’t get over not having a significant other? I have so much love to give and wish someone could see that in me and let me give it to them, but right now my love has nowhere to go. It’s been years. Despite my great progress, I feel broken and fundamentally unloveable. I don’t know if that will ever change, but it’s exhausting to feel this way simply because of a lack of a significant other. 

I don’t want to feel alone, but I don’t want to be alone. This condition sucks ",1754887305.0,9,0,BPD,bpd
1mn854i,I never feel good enough,"Im so tired of trying to hold everything together, to make sure people think im doing well when im really not. I used to cry almost every day and breakdowns literally once a week. The amount i cry and have breakdowns has gone down drastically, and i thought i was getting better but ive just had 2 breakdowns in the last 3 weeks (one of them being today), which is way more than im used to now and its taking a toll on my self esteem. So i decided to make a rant because i want to know if others feel like this and need to get it off my chest.

I get praised by family or friends when i seem good or havent cried in a while and told im ""normal even with bpd"". But im so stressed and tired all the time even when im not doing anything (like watching tv or lying in bed). My mom constantly points out all my faults and says things like ""how are you ever going to hold a job?"" Or ""how are you going to cope with a career"" when i have just 1 breakdown after ages of being okay. Anytime i cry or show anxiety thats her go-to phrase. I feel trapped in my feelings and my life. I know shes just worried about me but id love a day where she just tells me shes proud and thinks im doing well. All i feel is a dissapointment in her eyes, and everyones eyes even if they say they dont think that about me.

I constantly feel the need to be told im good, to be told im good enough and that im trying hard enough but to everyone else i know im not. Ive heard people say ""you exsisting and trying your best is good enough"" but its really not. To everyone else im never trying hard enough, i dont push myself enough, im not trying my best. Sometimes my best is staying at home and doing nothing because i dont want to go outside and i dont want to talk to people. My room is constantly a mess and i struggle so much to keep it tidy and clean. Some days i hate going outside, the sun feels too bright, and people always seem to find a way to talk to me. Idk what it is about my face or maybe theyre just friendly but can people stop coming up to talk to me for a chat.

I feel like a failure and that im not ""acting"" properly. I am overwhelmingly dissapointed in myself and even with the positive daily affirmations theres no one who hates me more than myself at the end of the day. 

I rememeber once my therapist said ""but who gives you reassuance"" and i said ""me"". Theres only ever been me to keep myself afloat and i try not to rely on anyone else other than myself. It was family therapy and my mom knows how important words of affirmation are to me but she doesnt seem to get it, saying ""so i should just comlipment you when youve done nothing all day?"" And i didnt even know what to say because is that what i want? That feels pointless, i feel like I want to her to just tell me randomly ""your doing your best and i can see that and im proud"". 

Overall, i just wish i was better all the time. Better at being organised and fun to be around. I feel like i am trying all the time but it amounts to nothing and then i have a breakdown and it all falls back down and i rememeber im still struggling and im not okay.

1mn9tfv,A little situationship into a big baseline dip (35F),"Since I can remember- trauma, survival mode, emotional dis regulation, intense mood swings, chaotic interpersonal relationships, s*elf h*rm, substance abuse and feeling like I’m beyond broken- have been my identity.

It wasn’t until last year, at the age of 35 I was finally (and all self educated, self supported and self driven) was motivated to seek answers. Got meself a case of the ol BPD, amongst depression (derrr) and now ADHD. 

I’ve been single for maybe 5 years. My last relationship was loving (he loved me and wanted to help me) but it dr*g fuelled, abusive (on both ends), volatile, just completely out of this world mental. Fast forward until today and I’ve been working on myself- getting great psych support, reading, art, good friends! plus meds, self care and slowly building my identity! 

Recently I met a guy at a party (after an alcohol and dr*g relapse) he seemed lovely, we hooked up (I’ve been solo, Celibate and an emotionally unavailable since doing all this work). I told him I didn’t want to have s*x but, he kept insisting and asking and I gave in. (Not my first time experiencing this at all, which is why I just gave up and surrendered). Anyway, you’d think I would have cut him off…. But since I’m very damaged, I doubled down and ignored those voices (“he maybe SA’s you, but you’re so used to this sh*t, was it your fault) and then invited him to dinner and he stayed over and basically all the whole love bombing me. I have been SO emotionally drained and conflicted and confused and I still feel pressure to see him. I denied his request to come over again last night and said I was feeling quite vulnerable and I’d had a hard week and no reply… (rejection OUCH) 

I hate how I’m thrown from stability and doing hella art projects back into this world of obsession, despair and pain. Especially after all the healing and work I’ve done. I’m trying to go easy on myself but these interactions with men just fuckn throw me everytime. 

Living alone and being single for 5 years. It’s the best! But it’s easy to get back into a little moment and have it throw you completely off course and remind you, solitary and self protective is where you need to be. ",1754909825.0,2,2,BPD,bpd

That created fear in him, which made him decide he didn’t want me in his future. He told me he was afraid I might commit suicide and he would feel guilty. (I was going through a very bad depression, partly pushed there by problems with his mother and his emotional abandonment.)

Then I confessed it to a friend who soon used it against me when I explained something that happened, and she immediately implied it was because of my impulsiveness (which is not true, and I explained it to her).

I’ve felt like shit. The love of my life doesn’t want me by his side. He was a very different person until recently, when he saw me depressed. I thought I had a solid and healthy relationship. I regret so much and hate myself. Yesterday, after a month apart, I couldn’t take it and spent hours writing to him and venting. At times I apologized and tried to be gentle and empathetic with him, then I turned into a sarcastic and mocking mess. My mood changed a thousand times over those hours.

1mnedr6,Behaviors and questions.,"I’ve started researching bpd the last couple of months in search of some answers to disruptive behaviors I have in relationships. I do have a history of eating disorders in my childhood as well as self harm. I’m in my mid thirties now, a professor, a single mom of an eleven year old, home owner. On the surface my life looks stable but internally I feel disconnected from everyone, deeply lonely, and going through intense thoughts of ending my life or running away completely.  I was single for a long time, only pretty brief casual relationships or situationships that I would obsess over for years after they ended. Three years ago I met a man when I was traveling in Europe. We stayed in contact through instagram, flirting a little bit. About 10 months after meeting he told me he thought about me a lot and wanted something more with me. This immediately lit every part of my brain and body on fire and he’s been my constant thought, partner, and lover for the last two years. I’ve been obsessed with him. Talking to him or thinking about talking to him every moment of the day. We want to build a life together and have made good steps in this direction. I am really scared though. Because I feel like I constantly put the relationship in jeopardy with outbursts and thoughtless bids for reassurance and attention.

For example, we are long distance so we have to live our own lives. We both love to party and go out. But he lives in a huge European city and I live in a tiny midwestern college town (plus I’m a mom without family support close by or many friends). So my opportunities are limited where his are plentiful. I struggle with intense jealousy when he is out, but ESPECIALLY when he’s out and meets girls and follows them on Instagram. I used to do this too, but I stopped. But lately I will really go deep into a spin out…getting to the point where I will mildly self harm again. I’ll think about it for days, staking them and their posts and stories to see if my boyfriend shows up on them. I convince myself that he wants them, and even masturbates thinking about them. Or dms them and starts something like he started with me three years ago. 

Instead of talking to him about my feelings sometimes I’ll accuse him of something. Like (tmi sorry) we are having phone sex and I blurt out - did someone offer to do that for you last night? As soon as we’re done. Or I’ll start a fight and say some shit I already know isn’t true. Just because I’m so overwhelmed by these feelings of being abandoned. 

He is growing so weary of my accusations based on feelings that come from nowhere. I do have a therapist and I don’t know if she’s helping. She seems to think I need to work on my anxiety, but he also needs to stop blowing up and then disappearing- sending me into a tailspin. She believes he is avoiding any responsibility. He believes there is an imbalance in the relationship where he always has to deal with my emotions. If he only knew all I was keeping from him and trying to manage on my own. 

The fucked up thing is that I’m ready to take responsibility. I want to grow up inside (he keeps referring to me as a toddler, and 
I feel like it too a lot). He says how can he raise a kid with someone who thinks she can open her mouth and say whatever comes to her mind? Then he said, how can you even raise your own kid? I know he’s stating to say that I’m really crazy and don’t want things to be good in our relationship. And I feel really lost.

Any advice? How to I keep from spiraling? I’m going on runs every day and trying to calm myself in a healthy way. I’m in therapy and I need to get back into my art and hobbies. Nothing feels as good as the attention of my boyfriend, but lately he resents me so much that it’s starting to hurt. ",1754922232.0,1,5,BPD,bpd
1mn9eyl,Struggle with breakup and self harm,"My ex-boyfriend of four years ended our relationship three weeks ago. One of the reasons he gave was that he stopped seeing me as a partner and more of someone who needed to be taken care of.

For context, I had moved continents to be with him. He lives in Spain, and I used to live in Mexico. So, I worked hard to get a job near him. I’m a programmer, and it was challenging to get my visa sponsored, but I finally did it.

I left my loved ones, pets, culture, routine, everything, to be near him. Even though I didn’t get the job in Spain, I managed to get it in the Netherlands. The plan was for him to move in with me, but he never really tried to.

Since I’m very introverted, I struggle a lot to make friends, so I’m quite lonely. I called him all the time to chat about my day, but he found it exhausting.

Now, I’m lonely in this country. Even though I don’t cut myself anymore, I’m battling so hard to stop doing it. I’m chainsmoking, knowing it harms me as much.

I don’t know how to deal with the breakup being alone here. I don’t have anyone to call anymore. I have nightmares, and all my friends are eight hours behind me since they’re in Mexico, so talking to them is difficult.

All it took was that, and I thought about it and even though he was sweet, kind and everything to me.

BUT

I didn't love him, I don't know if I'm capable of it.

So I broke up him a week after getting out of the hospital. He didn't take it very well. I told him that I still wanted him to be a part of my life and told him

""I want you to find someone better.'

And that was all it took, he started crying and left.

I figured I knew he was hurting, but I genuinely believe he deserves someone better. And I think the breakup went well.

Only for my friend Helen (Named changed for privacy) to blow up my phone a week afterwards. She was the one who introduced me to him.

""WHAT THE HECK DID YOU DO?! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HURT HIM?!""

I was shocked, I knew my ex struggled with depression but apparently he had been having a really hard time accepting it.

I told her what I told him and I could hear her facepalm over the phone.

""Breanna.....NOBODY who thinks someone is a good guy says 'I want you to find someone better' everyone knows thats just a way to soften the blow. What it translates to is 'I want to find someone better.'

And then I started panicking because I didn't want my ex to think that I thought less of him or that I wanted to find someone else! I just wanted to live my life in a certain way that wasn't compatible with him!

I thought I was being nice to him telling him that when I broke up.

But apparently that wasn't the right thing to do. But the worse part was I sent screenshots of my exes and Is text conversations to defend myself. And then she was pointing out 'Breanna....literally everything you said implies that you wanted to find a better man than him.'

About a month into dating he expressed that he didn’t trust me having a cell phone and was thinking I was cheating on him, so I threw my phone off a bridge. I cut off all contact with anyone but him, he put cameras in every room of our house. I was being monitored 24/7. I agreed to drug tests once a week which I never failed. As time went on he became more controlling to the point when we were out in public if another man was in our vicinity I would make sure to look at the ground to avoid being accused of “making eyes” at other men. I was accused of cheating on him daily. Besides the false accusations I was constantly criticized and called every horrible name you could think of. Eventually I snapped during an argument and hit him, he hit me back with 100 times to force I inflicted on him. I know I shouldn’t have been violent and he says he was defending himself but out of the two of us I was the only one with bruises, knots and broken fingers. I tried to leave several times but whenever I would be separated from him and the reality of being alone set in, I was like a junkie needed him again. All I could think of was I gotta get back to him. He lost our home because he refused to work or let me have a job and he could no longer support us so he moved in with his mother where I am not comfortable being.

1mn5tow,Living with unaccepting Parents,"Hi, It's been a few months since i've been officially diagnosed? with bpd/eupd- so bare with me as i'm still coming to terms and understanding everything if that makes sense. i have been trying for six years to get a diagnosis from being told im just depressed to saying im bipolar ive finally had the correct assessments and have my answer!! Yay. But on to the matter at hand. I'm a Univeristy student (college i guess in the usa) and from september to june i live away from home (i think it's important to add im only 40 mins away from my parents in student housing yet they've never come to visit me in three years of me being there) So rightfully, over the summer i have to move home as i can't afford to stay there as it's £2000 and i don't have that.

 I find having a job hard, i love working especially in pubs/ bars but after a while something happens and i switch to a person i don't know and i can't even get out of bed. So moving home- i was open with my mother about my new diagnosis and explained everything to her in a way she would understand. My father on the other hand cannot know. He is basically against mental health. As stupid as it sounds. My father clearly has ptsd from time in service, aswell as other things but looks down on treatment and medication as it makes a person ""weak"" and ""what good is a pill gonna do"" 

Since moving home, my best friend of six years has dropped me, he claimed i've said horrible things about him to people. I'm the most loyal girl out there, someone close to me would never be spoken bad of in any situation. if i love you, you know i'm never gonna mess up that friendship. So rightfully after that situation happened (i won't go into it but it's obvious someone who doesn't like me, has been making things up) i was upset. Abandonment very promiment in my head. He didn't even ask for my side and it hurt. I've been talking to friends and getting out of it but it hurts. 

My parents offered no affection or love. Now onto the main issue. My parents don't really want me about. I'm too easy to upset. I'm too emotional. On weekends i usually drive an hour to see my boyfriend however with no money and other things it's hard- which is an inconvenience to them as they want to do their own things (i'd like to point out i'm 22 and im only home because i have no money and no where to crash until september. so i stay out their way) If i talk to my parents about anything they will state after about 60 seconds ""bored now"" or ""go see your friends your talking too much"" so in turn i go into my room, as my friends live hours away. i'm then anti social and never spend time with them and sending myself to an early grave for lack of fresh air and exercise. So then i go out- which they need to know when, where, how long the contradictions continue. 

every morning my parents have coffee and sit in bed. I will walk in to say good morning and sometimes sit with them to ask about their plans for the day. Today, my father asked me why i was there, i said it was to say hi and just see what today plan was for them. He turned and looked at me and said ""hi, bye you can go now"" instantly it hurt. Like a level i'm used to but it hurt. i got up said i needed to go to the bathroom anyway and left. To which that was recieved as me being a bitch and i got shouted at. 

I'm at a loss here. I cannot talk to my parents, spend time with them without being a ""leech"" or annoying. My friends live far away and are busy anyway, my boyfriend has a life of his own and i'm only allowed at his two nights a week (he lives with his parents also and his sister kicks off if i'm there more that two nights as it's unfair her boyfriend can't stay that long) Nothing i do is good enough and i just want to know if trying so much will work or if i need to find something to hide from it all.

1mmr8t7,Starting to feel like I can only really connect with other borderlines,"I haven't known a lot of other people with BPD in my life, and when I have the connections haven't lasted long (naturally), but when I have, there's this intense sense of... connection? Understanding? Recognition? Like it's the only time I feel like I'm talking to a member of my own species. It's the only time the loneliness that eats away at me 24/7 fades away a bit.

It's not that I can't be friends with neurotypicals. I don't have a lot of friends, but I have one or two people I'm close to, and I enjoy their company and value those connections. But it's just not the same. I like those people, but I don't understand them. I don't relate to them. They're aliens to me. Pleasant aliens whom I care about, but aliens all the same. I'm starting to think I'll never be able to really connect with anyone who doesn't have BPD (or maybe PTSD or similar, I guess, IDK). I especially worry I'll never be truly fulfilled in a romantic relationship unless my partner also has BPD.

It's not even the intensity that I crave. I don't need someone who clings to me 24/7 or who can't live without me. I just want to be with someone who's felt the same pain I have. I want to be with people who know how hard it is to live with this constant tempest in your soul.

But I feel like it's an unattainable goal. It seems like connections between borderlines (especially romantic ones) are near impossible to maintain long term, and I feel like actively trying to pursue such a thing would just land me in toxic situations. I have an opportunity to attend another DBT group in a few weeks (I've already done DBT twice), and if I'm being honest with myself the only reason I'm considering going is the opportunity to meet other borderlines and maybe make a friend (or more), and that just doesn't feel like a healthy impulse or an appropriate use of a DBT group.

1mn4124,I feel like I've lost my life,"28M here, diagnosed since the age of 23

I hadn't struggled with BPD symptoms since my last official relationship in 2023, and even then I was able to overcome most of them by the 4th month of the relationship, we were together for a little more than a year and I broke it up because of issues within the relationship, and because I wanted to be single again and to experience new things. Since then, I had been living single life and I honestly enjoyed it a lot, as people with BPD, you know how refreshing it can be to just (responsibly) hook up with people without instantly attaching and them becoming your whole life, being able to have a sexual life while still remaining focused on your goals and your life.

However, at the start of this year, I started hooking up with a girl that had been my friend for some years and things just started happening, and I slowly started feeling strong things again. Long story short, I fell for her, decided to give up my single life and asked her to be my girlfriend in April, she accepted. She is from my hometown and I moved back here some days before we became official, after living in the capital of my country for +10 years.

Since then, my mental health has been declining to a point that I don't believe I had seen it decline before (the only possible equivalent being 2020, in which I had some substance abuse issues), and fear of abandonment and codependency have completely taken over my life, I've become a person that can barely move a finger if I don't feel sure that she is not going to abandon me or hurt me (even though she hasn't), and all of the drive, focus and discipline that used to be my pillars have completely vanished. I can't sleep if I don't know she got home safe, I can't wake up if she hasn't responded to my last text, I can barely stand more than 2 days without seeing her, I sleep all day, I'm constantly paranoid that she will suddenly disappear, and work has become an extremely difficult thing to do (I'm an online English teacher) so I cancel classes very often. My context has not helped either, I don't have many friends in this city and my job doesn't allow me to be in a social context daily so that I can distract myself and get some perspective when I start obsessing or spiraling.

This has been an extremely heartbreaking thing for me, I feel like I had a whole life ahead of me that I had spent years building and that great things were coming for me, and now it's all destroyed because I overestimated my capacity of handling a relationship again. Even the money that I had saved up is almost completely gone from having to use it to handle crises (ordering food in bad days which are most, therapist appointments, psychiatrist appointments, paying for a coworking space to prevent myself from spiraling when working at home).

Even my relationships have been affected, I'm very expressive and outgoing so when I have these crises I have them in front of my aunts and my friends, and even though they try their best, they don't know how to help me.

I feel like I'm in a labrinth in which I'm either a slave to every single one of her actions (even though she has been very understanding of my BPD and we have tried to work through everything that has come up), or I break up with her, and then I'll be in for a world of pain that I'm not sure I can handle (I broke up with her some weeks ago for one day, in the middle of a crisis, and the pain was something that I don't think I had ever experienced before, not like this).

I love my friends.  Obviously.  I love being around them and thinking about them and knowing they're thinking about me.  I've been excited about going back to school since before summer break started.  After some recent reflection during an appointment with my new psychiatrist, I've realized that my bpd symptoms have severely decreased because I haven't been seen any of my friends more than once or twice a month.  Now, I'm terrified to get back to campus in a week.  My symptoms spiked like crazy fall semester of last year, and while I know I already have my friend group and am familiar to the environment, so it likely won't be as bad as freshman year, I feel like I should have been preparing or doing something to make the adjustment easier for myself.  I have felt SO GOOD about the progress I've made thanks to meds, therapy, and an insane amount of work, but now I'm realizing that the forced isolation from my fp and anyone else I've become intensely attached to (and having been sober all summer) probably had a huge part in that.

1mn2wxp,Struggling with splitting episode with a long term partner,"I’ve been married to my wife for 7 years now. My wife has strong abandonment issues. I suspect this is due to her history of parental separation and her father taking on other wives without formally divorcing her mom.

In the beginning it was very confusing, but she would have what I can now describe as splitting episodes at the slightest of triggers - one time I was changing travel plans to see her over a weekend because my childhood friend was making an impromptu trip to come see me (we were partially long distance at the time), another time she felt disrespected for me using the phone at dinner because I checked a text notification. I suspect these examples are familiar to people here. 
What would follow would be intense emotional arguments about how I’m an insufficient and uncaring partner, how she’s ending things and that she hates everything about me. Over time I realized these invariably end with me breaking down and crying. And then she would go back to normal-ish and make up with me and apologize (but without realizing the intensity of the situation for me). Over time I started laying my own boundaries on my own. She started seeing an amazing therapist, who said she doesn’t have BPD but has a tendency for it. But the episodes gradually grew apart and then went away for a couple of years. 

Until this weekend. For context, my entire family, who my wife isn’t very close to due to drama during our wedding, is visiting the country for my sister’s wedding. Last week, my wife had an outburst over an innocuous infraction from me and it suddenly exploded. There was a sharp outburst and yelling and then she gave me the silent treatment. We were doing things - even went to catch shows and a movie but the conversation for all this was brief or over text. I kept a normal, positive tone while interacting with her. Yesterday I was supposed to travel to the city my family is in for wedding prep and she is supposed to join me on a couple days. I tried talking to her in a normal (not sad) tone a few times. She started sleeping on the couch in a different room so I ate dinner there trying to unsuccessfully have a conversation.

I really wanted to resolve things before leaving because I know she has abandonment issues and me getting on a plane while she’s upset would get to her even more. So I made us breakfast and initiated a conversation, this time in a calmer and reassuring in tone.
This is when I’d say the splitting really started. I got the same accusations and hateful and disrespectful remarks of being uncaring and not invested in the relationship from a couple years ago. I was devastated and also had my guard down and I ended up missing my flight. 
When I did go to the airport to get on a later flight, she accused me of lying that I missed my flight so I sent her proof. While at the airport, it finally clocked to me  what was happening - it’s that splitting episode. I didn’t get a flight so had to come back home that night, and tried talking to her again. This time more firmly in the mindset of I’m not talking to a hateful person I’m just talking to a very sick version of my wife I love. 

I’d say I made some progress. Nasty things were said again but she gave indications of being very hurt and stressed. I made the mistake of telling her you’re not this person, you’re experiencing an episode and that wasn’t taken well. Finally, she came to bed and was a lot calmer, but still firm on separating. 
We went to sleep cuddling and I left in the morning when she was still sleeping and groggy but she said bye to me. 
I thought we made progress but it’s still not the case. I want to give her space and have my boundaries but I’ve never been away from her when she had an episode. 
All day today I’ve again been getting texts about how we’re separating, she is not coming to the wedding which is extremely important to me and will be really humiliating to explain to many many guests why she isn’t there, let alone my own family. And hers too, who as of now are also coming. 
Her pattern of splitting and idealization (she tells me we’ll die together, playfully accuses me of planning to leave her, gets stressed days in advance of me going on a trip) is incredibly private - only the two of us know. Now when I’m looking at this potentially blowing up to the whole family and friend circle in what is supposed to be a family celebration, I feel alone and helpless and I’m seeking advice.

Then the headache came in at the same time as I suddenly lost what little bit of will to live I had- I completely wanted to stab myself to death and started spiraling while venting to friends- It went on for about an hour of me going from dissociation to extreme sadness to anger against myself back and forth with the only constant being a wish for death. Eventually I couldn’t take it and got some ibuprofen aswell as cut myself again which actually did snap me out of it.

I never go out, I never do anything) so I wanted to seem more ‘normal’ to others. But I don’t know I always thought that was kind of a concerning thing.

1mmwntn,My doctor told me my BPD was historical.,"Hey everybody, so Im diagnosed with schizophrenia and bpd. Or so I thought. I saw my psychiatrist the other day and we talked about what I was diagnosed with and I asked about my bpd. He told me it was historical and never explained what that meant. I didn’t ask him in the moment either and im not sure why. I guess I was a little shocked. My schizophrenia seems to be under control for the most part, I don’t hear the voices anymore which is good but I still struggle really badly with bpd symptoms. Our appointment was short and he wanted to focus on the schizophrenia more than anything else so we didn’t get to talk about me and bpd very much. 

I still struggle with bpd symptoms pretty badly. I was upset when I learned more about what historical bpd meant from the internet. It basically means it was part of my past medical history but not part of my current active diagnosis. I felt quite upset about that. I felt invalidated because i obviously still struggle with bpd. My partner agrees because she has to witness it when I split on her or when I have my episodes. Idk. I think I’m going to talk to my case manager about it. Or call my family doctor and tell her what im going through. I know she’ll listen. 

Have any of you heard of or experienced something similar? It sucks feeling invalidated and like nobody cares. ",1754866342.0,1,4,BPD,bpd
1mmwn5j,I don't know what to do,"I have never made a post on Reddit, so bear with me. To give some context: my girlfriend has BPD, and we recently reached our one-year anniversary. I’m very happy to have her in my life and I love her very much, but the thing is, I don’t know what to do anymore.

We argue practically every day. Sometimes there’s a day that goes by without arguments, but it’s almost always filled with conflict. During the first 3–4 months of our relationship, it was the most fun I’ve ever had in my entire life. I was overjoyed to have her in my life. But after that, problems and arguments started popping up.

I researched online and found out that every relationship goes through an “argument phase.” This is my first relationship, so I’ve been learning with her, and I’ve always tried to give it my all because I really want to make this work. But the problem is, it never stopped. It’s been eight months now, and the further we got from the start of winter, the more we started arguing.

The nights we used to spend playing games and chatting until morning last year have now turned into constant arguments. The only reason we stay up late now is because we’re fighting. I don’t know what to do anymore. I do everything she asks me to do. I’ve changed in so many ways that I’m basically a completely different person from who I was a year ago.

I don’t want to keep arguing, but I don’t see any other way. I want to make this relationship work, but I’m afraid I might not be able to. The mental strain of remembering a million different things she’s asked me to do—and not to do—every day over the past eight months is really getting to me.

I’ve thought about breaking up a few times before, but I ultimately chose to give it my all and not give up. And just to clarify—the reason she keeps bringing stuff up and we keep arguing is partly because of me. I know I sometimes do or say things I shouldn’t, and she’s definitely valid in bringing those up. But most of the time, it’s not like that—and she even says so herself sometimes.

I know it’s probably because of BPD, or at least that’s what she says. She’s a good person, and I don’t want to leave her. But I also don’t want to feel miserable for my whole life. Please help me.",1754866294.0,1,0,BPD,bpd

It's been months since I've hung out or hooked up or even texted with any of them and it's thrust me into an identity crisis or something.

I feel like I only exist when I have someone I'm obsessed with and they feel the same about me. I've been going through a cycle since I stopped being a shut-in a few years ago, where I find someone just like me, we obsess over each other, have a lot of sex, and I try to be like them as much as possible. I dress similar, I talk like them, I listen to the same music, pathetic shit like that. It usually fades on both our ends and we even out into mostly normal friends, but I've always had a rebound with finding someone else to love, and that hasn't happened again, so I'm just stuck here in my own head lol.

I just feel so empty and fake and it hurts. Everything I liked about myself came from someone else, and I now realize that there's no reason to keep any of it up if no one I love is here to see it. My whole personality is a mask and I really, really hate the girl behind it.

I've been desperately searching for attention and affection, going on dates and fucking people I'm not even attracted to just to feel anything, but it's all grey and flavorless and I just want to fade away. When I think of my real self I just want to torture her, cut, throw up, and die.

1mmwaly,Do you have a 'safe' person?,"A lot of my life I've questioned if I have BPD or if my intense emotions when it comes to other people is just a mix of my Autism and other factors of my life. I know it's not uncommon for Autistic people to develop BPD or another disorder/condition alongside Autism because of just the experience of being Autistic but I understand the importance of not jumping to label yourself. 

Ever since I've turned 20 (Young people aren't typically diagnosed with BPD which is why I've been waiting 'till I was older to think about it more) and puberty ended I found that I've been calmer and freak out less over small things (because puberty is over, I'm assuming)- I still feel things intensely a lot of the time, sometimes slipping back to feeling as strongly if not stronger than how I felt as a teenager. Lately I've been crashing out and crying almost every other day because someone I used to have a crush on (the first person to show 'interest' in me) told me they were aroace and didn't think they wanted a relationship and sometimes it's okay and sometimes I'm so angry or upset that it's unbareable. I'm worried my best friend might be sick of how much I've crashed out in her dms over it. No matter how hard I try to be logical about it, it feels like it'll never go away. Not for a long time at least.

My best friend is actually one of the main reasons why I'm hesitant to say I might have BPD. I've had two friends with BPD claim me as one of their own a few years ago and people in my life tell me it 'sounds like me'. But this best friend that I have, I love her a lot but she basically never triggers the intense feelings others trigger in me. I feel normal with her, it's really nice because I didn't think I could feel that way with anyone ever.

My husband got prescribed medication for the first time ever and I wanted to share your insights with him since he doesn't speak English and he's actually really scared of the process. I'll be translating your comments for him.

They prescribed him Lamotrigine but he was feeling the worst he's ever felt for weeks so he decided to stop taking them and maybe try a different medication in the future (so he says, but he's dead scared because of the symptoms he got from this experience). 

The thing is he's using marijuana often, which I'm not against, but it's the only thing that ever worked on him and he hates having to use it daily because it leaves him feeling depleted and, whenever he stops using for a couple of days, he gets severly worse too.

He said he would give me one more chance, so I better be fully healed when I decide to take that chance. He said if I mess up again he’ll get an EPO on me. Is it even possible to never split on someone again? Should I take the chance or let him go? Am I being selfish?

I feel like I’m just an emotional support dog. And I don’t really know about a big part of her life. This hurts my feelings.  What is that about? Also sometimes she has this attitude of superiority like she’s so above me? Like somebody asked are we sisters and she said “ew” and walked away from me.

She gets upset at me when I hangout with my other friends. And always wants to control everything thing we do together. If I plan a hangout she will decline or come and try to control it or sulk the whole time. To make it miserable.  She doesn’t really tell me much about what happened on campus. (I live off campus). I think is odd that she lives on campus and always ask me to come with her to events when she has access to other ppl on campus. 

I suspect that she sabotages my talking stages with guys. Everytime i tell her I like a guy or I’m talking to someone. It all of a sudden falls apart. The guy stops talking to me. I feel like I’m her possession and she doesn’t even see me as a real person. She also obsesses over who is following me or I follow on social media. Who commented.

He’s even gone as far as to say I’m grounded? 

Some more info I’d like to add on top of this is that he wants a trad wife that’s submissive and sub-servant. He’s definitely let me know that I don’t meet this category good enough but I’m his responsibility because he took my virginity. He’s an “orthodox Christian” that has been to church with me once at an Orthodox Church since we’ve been together. He wants a “traditional” lifestyle. 

I also would like to say that I do have bpd and pcos and due to this he thinks I shouldn’t have kids because it will get passed along and because he questions how my parenting will be. SO instead he wants to have polygamy in our relationship with or without my consent. Due to his “traditional” values, he wants A LOT of kids and I’m not fitting into that role.

It’s like I can’t handle anything being in a state of uncertainty. I either need to hear from them or I need to be okay with never hearing from them again. I end up having to resolve myself to eternities just to deal with a few hours or days. 

I try to live my life going with the flow. People come and go, and you gotta just enjoy them while they’re around. But sometimes you meet someone you just can’t help but want to spend more time with. The newer someone is - the less time I’ve spent with them, the greater my desire to interact with them right now this second. To give myself the long exposure I need to properly imprint them on myself. So I can understand and keep them with me even when they go. 

The real injustice that hurts more than eventual departure is when a false sense of trajectory is established and then diverted. You feel like you’ll have days or weeks or months in which to get to know them, to ask them questions about their life and learn how they think. 

Then once you part, for however brief or long a period, you feel like your life is holding its breath until the next interaction. 

Has anyone successfully sequestered these feelings?

1mmtct1,"Split on bf again, he wants to break up","*undiagnosed*

As the title says, I’ve had another episode on my bf over something very small. He was on his phone & it makes me feel like he’s bored with me. I blew things up & said a ton of hurtful things that left him wanting to break up. We have done this a few times & he will block me but we will get back together at the end of the week. He’s been going back & forth on being done for good, saying we can take a break, to blocking me again & then I will split again & say more hurtful things. He is the type of person that needs space to think when things get stressful. Space for me creates uncertainty which makes my brain run wild. I’ll blow his phone up repeatedly going back & forth between apologizing & then blaming him. I know it’s overwhelming & while I do think it’s unfair he keeps going back & forth, he is trying to protect both of us. I know he doesn’t want to give up, but he has been saying for months now that it hurts to fight & be told he’s “always/never” doing something right when it’s usually my attitude that sets things off. 

How do I give him space? Should I just accept that we are done & leave him alone? It’s so hard to do that when I don’t mean to hurt him & I do want to change these behaviors, but it doesn’t feel like it’s fast enough. Whenever I’m alone long enough, I go right back to destructive behaviors like blowing his phone up even if I’m blocked & that’s not cool. When I’m done, I’m in that moment of clarity where I’m left apologizing for even more & some things can’t be unsaid.

1mmt992,The part of recovery nobody tells you about: just how lonely and empty and it can feel,"So there are two huge upsides:


1. I like myself now, like even through this really rough recent rut I’ve never once fell into negative self talk


2. While I still feel all the heavy intense stuff, I know when to act on it and when not to



Now that this is out of the way, I’ve come to realize that outside of older habits like people pleasing, actively pushing, discarding boundaries, latching on and so on… I know absolutely nothing 


I’ve recently begun actually pulling away from a long 11 month push-pull with someone that I’ve actually been my best in. Not clingy, fully myself, not people pleasing and so on - and it’s not that they didn’t like spending time with me, it’s more that external circumstances made things very very complicated. I’m also trying to make a bunch of new friends and so on 


But through all this, especially when you are getting into your 30s, to turn away and realize “I’m alone now, again. Same as always” - it hits different… and not good different. You realize you’re back in this routine of being hyper independent which was fine once upon a time, but now you’re just thinking “what’s the point of going through all this?” - but also, you’ve been burned one too many times, and this time in a more vivid way cause you tried to do things right to where you start thinking “is this it? Is this just how I’m meant to be?”


And there is this other factor of other people simply not knowing what’s going on inside you - all the weight, complicated feelings, and so on. Frankly, being functional in itself takes a ton of emotional and mental effort and energy - but people don’t see that, they’ll just think you’re weird, or odd, or wonder why you’re always alone and feel like you have a big weight on all the time. 



Thing is, in the past I didn’t understand how people can fall into just… succumbing to the isolation, prior to being diagnosed I was falling into my own patterns and after, despite trying actively, you start to see that others see your active effort as “what red flags does this person have?” Rather than “what if I tried to understand them” - and what’s worse is that when you do try to get close to people, you don’t want to reveal this side of yourself because it is too intense and too much for them, problem is, lots of people themselves aren’t great communicators so you end up feeling like you’re in a loop that’s familiar to what you’ve been used to. 



Idk - I’m mostly just feeling hopeless and tired for the most past. A part of me wants to keep trying but a part of me is thinking “maybe if I give it enough time I can go back to being detached and hyper independent” ",1754857850.0,1,0,BPD,bpd

I (18F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) who is diagnosed with BPD for a year. He’s the loveliest, kindest guy i’ve ever met and makes active effort to improve himself but things have got really bad lately.

He had a psychotic episode (no diagnosed cause yet) but I feel it could’ve been caused by how extremely anxious he gets over abandonment. The level of pressure and stress he puts himself under to try and make sure I don’t abandon him is unlike anything else i’ve seen. He thinks he needs to do absolutely everything for me and if any action of his is not complete perfection in his mind he will become completely distraught and convinced i’ll abandon him.

During his psychotic episode, he yelled at me a few times (i was never fearful of anything physical nor do i think it would occur) but I don’t believe he remembers this, is this something I should move past or bring up?

He has now fallen into a very severe depressive episode and to be honest, in some ways, I am exhausted. It’s in no way his fault but the constant sobbing and complete conviction in the idea I would abandon him is really tiring, I do my best to make it clear I have no intention of that without validating problematic behaviours, but it doesn’t seem to work.

I live in the UK and he has very little mental health support, which I have been trying to change with no success. I have called the GP multiple times which ends in a useless appointment, I’ve called 111 and the mental health crisis team, with a similar outcome. I’ve completed about 6 referrals for therapy services in my area with no luck, and if i’m honest i’m lost on what to do.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been mourning my childhood, knowing I’ll never again be loved simply for existing and being small. I stopped enjoying my birthdays around age 6, realizing each year meant fewer mistakes forgiven and less freedom to enjoy what I like. On my 12th birthday, I cried, convinced childhood was over. ""12 sounds so much bigger than 11.""
When I started having favorite people (unlike the shorter fixations I've had on people as a child), it made me forget about everything else. Having a favorite person made that fear fade, until she left. Then it came back even worse, and I spent months feeling envy, grief, and this evil voice that my bpd is would constantly make sure to let me know how I've “wasted"" my childhood worrying about growing up, and that there's nothing I can do to go back now. 

One day, I grabbed my roller skates and went to the park, worried what people would think of me. But then I heard a gentler voice, “You are a kid, go be one!! What are you waiting for?” And then I realized I still have two years left to enjoy my childhood, and I don’t want to waste them.

Also before I feel some sense of friendship it’s far too easy for me to not care about offending them and in the past I would kind of start arguments for entertainment without care for how it effected them but I also didn’t understand how much it affected them because I didn’t understand they care about my opinion of them and their beliefs, values, and knowledge. 

I’ve had multiple friends that seemed almost worried about me when they found out I wasn’t sure if they actually cared about me or not. I feel like to me a lot of it looks the same so I learned to just not care too much. 
At one point my friend referred to me as being a close friend and I mentioned not knowing that she felt that way and she said something like “We’ve been meeting for coffee and talking about all the details of our lives for 3 years… and you were at my wedding…” which yeah when it’s out that way I can see it. After that conversation and letting her perspective sink in I did start to feel more of a bond and trust. 
I experienced a similar interaction more recently and the pattern became more obvious.

I also just don’t feel the same as the rest of humanity. It feels like I’ve seen the darkest sides of so many people and seen the systemic abuse, it’s hard for me to feel like we’re even the same creature despite being far too aware of those human behaviors in me, I just feel very disconnected from my own sense of being human. Sometimes I meet people and it’s like I can see some aspect of myself in them but it’s often not exactly a good think, equally sometimes I encounter people that my mind just immediately registers as being fake and predatory because they have a lot of the same dangerous behaviors as people of my past. 

Sorry for such a long post. I’m just not sure if this is somehow a result of my BPD or what exactly it is.

I'm 26yr F been diagnosed since August 2020.  However even before my diagnosis of BPD I knew there was something off about me .

I can't handle rejection. Like at all. When people cut me out of there , block on their social media or phone 
 . I spiral completely out of control. 

Either I'm threatening to end my life ( or actually make an attempt) I'm SH in some form (over eating, c*tting ) or I make a fake social media page to see what's going on 😪 (absolute cringe) 

It seems I feel like rejection is a death sentence. Like I'll never have anyone ever again. Maybe I won't.

How do you handle rejection or people not wanting you?",1754828078.0,2,1,BPD,bpd
1mmoopt,I got broken up with over text,"My post history tells the story leading up to this. I’ve been pretty calm in my responses to him over the past few weeks, but anytime I have tried to express how we got here, or my feelings being hurt, he takes is harsh criticism and shames me because he’s hit a bad flare and he’s unwell. 

My last message to him was:

I'm sorry it’s that bad. Are you getting enough help? I'm trying to understand what's happening, you don't just break up with someone you love because you're in a flare, and over text. I don't know how we can go from you saying you love me and to come up north to talking to me like you barely like me.
To get to the point where you don't want to speak to me, to not respect me enough to give me a call to talk about this. You're throwing away so much

And he responded with:

You kw i hav no help. I'm in hell.. Is kn I in agony without med not enou for u.
A call/sp 2 u?! I'm in flar. Cnt eat.
Sham on u. i said WKs ago, do what u need, fnd Ur joy. Lv me alon

I just don’t know what to do other than respect he wants to be left alone. I feel like he’s majorly self-sabotaging. He’s said before in a flare that he’s had nothing left, and then he snapped out of it and we ended up doing lots of lovely things over the summer together.",1754847313.0,1,4,BPD,bpd

Over my stay my team has said that i meet 7 of criteria and have been diagnosed with bpd. Honestly, i don’t care abt at all just so tired of everything but my problem is how she portrayed it. I ask if it was a ‘bad thing to have’, and her reply was ‘Well yeah, it’s a personality disorder. It basically means you have a bad and dysfunctional personality.’ 

Now it is entirely possible that i am completely over reacting and just being precious and over sensitive, but was that really the response to my question?

1mmogs7,Toxic relationships and paranoia,"I (29F) need a rant/advice. I am BPD and have not been doing well. I couldn't afford therapy, lost my job and had exams coming up. I have been living with a boyfriend (33M) whom I thought was loving and caring and with whom I thought I had one of my healthiest relationship. I unraveled in the past 6 months, lost 20 pounds, not sleeping, splitting, verbally abusive, jealous, and he handles me well usually. My mother, with whom I have a complex relationship and who I suspect may be BPD as well, has suggested that him not putting boundaries and leaving me in these moments is a sign that he isn't healthy either and that this relationship is doomed.
I went into his past relationships (I know bad idea) and realize that he has had a pattern of going out with women who were not doing well. His last ex was schizophrenic, hallucinating, not showering for weeks, and he maintained a relationship, would go on double dates, remain sexual, despite her clearly not doing well. 
I'm starting to requestion everything. I know I'm unwell and toxic in this relationship. But was there a pattern of minimization and enabling on his part? Do some people who end up with people with BPD ""like"" that they're unwell? I currently don't trust my perceptions or feelings at all and would appreciate any insight.

1mm304p,I only feel happy when I’m in a relationship…,"Recently, I went through a break up, and although I had feelings of inadequacy, jealousy and just ruminating on negative things, it was also the healthiest relationship I was in because previously I had been in DBT and talk therapy for over 3 years, I felt I was fully ready to be in a committed relationship, I even stopped therapy a few months after I met my ex because everyone felt like I was in remission including myself. 

During that relationship, I did have some BPD episodes, but I recognize them immediately and apologize for behaving the way I did, and took full responsibility for my behavior in those toxic moments, which honestly didn’t happen often. 

Unfortunately, my ex was very toxic and had a lot of issues that he hadn’t worked out before meeting me, it’s a very long story that I rather not get into. 

Fast forward to today, it’s been around four months that we’ve been broken up, and I’ve been miserable every day since and most of my BPD symptoms have come back, I honestly feel like my ex was a big reason why I’m like this again. Nothing makes me happy. I try to do hobbies, focus on myself, not think about the past but NOTHING works. 

I am both physically and mentally drained, I either feel everything all at once or nothing at all, the pain is so excruciating it feels like I’m being burned alive, I can’t breathe, I have extreme panic attacks that last hours sometimes, and I have nonstop thoughts of taking my life for over 4 months now. 

I’m starting to realize that as miserable as I was in that relationship because my ex was toxic, I was happier being in that relationship than I was being out of it. That’s the thing though, I only feel happy when I’m in a relationship, nothing else seems to really bring me joy, not hobbies, not focusing on myself, maybe animals and nature, but that that’s about it and that doesn’t make me as happy anymore since my breakup. I even called up my ex one time and I was like I don’t want friends, I just wanna be in a relationship. I haven’t been able to maintain friendships most of my life anyways because of my extreme social anxiety and my trust issues, and friends don’t really fill that empty void inside me.

Genuinely the only thing that seems to fill the void in me is being in a relationship even if I have PBD symptoms, even if it’s toxic, nothing else makes me happy, and it’s been like this for as long as I can remember. 

I genuinely don’t care about anything, I don’t care about having hobbies, I don’t care about taking care of myself, if I have friends, I do care about them, but they don’t fill that void for me. The only other thing that somewhat fills that void is traveling, but not to the extent that being a relationship does. 

I’ve been feeling this way since I was about 13, probably longer than that if I’m being real, I just haven’t been able to care about anything or get anything done because I’m always looking for my next relationship.

Does anyone else feel this way?",1754780828.0,27,11,BPD,bpd

1mmf92i,"I am now, ready to heal for my gf/FP that left me 1 month ago, scared it my be euphoria","female turning 18! ( bad translation cus english isn't my first language )

My gf and I had a reallyyyy hard relationship for so many reasons. First, when I met her I was still at my mom's place where she would abuse me mentally and sometimes physically. She was against me having a relationship, so I had to hide it. We would see eachother outside or at her place. BUT, she is trans, and when i met her she didn't come out yet, and I know my mother would NEVER accept a hetero relationship, but a LESBIAN RELATIONSHIP, WITH A TRANS PERSON??? She would die. Anyway, the first months were fine, until I started to show BPD symptoms, and they became bigger and bigger with the time, alot becauzse of my toxic environnement. Everytime my mom upsetted me or pissed me off, I would reject everything on her, and she was strong for staying. I was jealous because she spent too much time with her friends on LOL, would never instantly respond to my messages and bla bla bla you know the deal. Split after split, we became gfs, then friends, then friends w benefits, then strangers, over and over again for 3 years. Between that, I got to a psych ward after a suicidal attempt and went to live with my dad, which is SO MUCH better. Even tho things at home were chill, I was still in a depression state because I didn't wanted to get better and my ED got worse. I was not doing great and, guess what, I would let her know. 

But this time, it was just too much. I splitted and insulted her bunch or horrible words to say to a trans person, but I still liked her, and I hate my brains for hating her at just random times. Since that, she did not replied to my messages. I sended vocals of me crying and apologizing, then just me talking casually to the void, since she did not answered any. 2 weeks later, I send her a message : message unsend, she blocked me :) I talked to her on another social media to notice that her bio changed to some romantic lyrics, and a girl commented "" I eat you {name} "". I looked at this girl's profil and saw that we had friends in common. I found that really weird, but I just thought it was a friend, it's girls girl behaviour to flirt after all. I contacted my FP to know what was happening and she told me that she just couldn't continue any of that, and that she is currently flirting with someone else and that I should get over her because she doesn't love me anymore. That girl in the comments. Everybody knew that she had a situationship with someone else, will I was still waiting for her to reply. 2. weeks. 

I started crying and sobbing a apologizing, but she was still on her decision. She wanted to forget me. We met in front of her place to talk about it, I was holding her hands, telling her how much I love her, that I will change, for real this time because my dad is not against our relationship, that we do not have to hide anymore and everytime I feel a split coming I could talk to it with my dad. She didn't even looked at me in the eyes, gently pushing my hands away when I was trying to hug or hold her. She was juste saying with a tired voice "" I can't "" "" I don't want to "" "" I can't do this anymore "". I ended up sitting in the street, crying and scratching my face to blood, and it felt like dying. Not like the other time, because I know we would go back  together in a way, this one was really hurtful. I stopped eating and drinking for 3 days, begging her to stay at 2 am on ig but the answer was the same. And, I don't know how, but I kind of got a sparke.The problem was me, I always knew it. But when she was talking to me, she used the words "" forget "" or "" healing "" towards me. And if she wants to forget, maybe it's because she still have a bit of love, but needs time and healing on her side to maybe reconsider our relation. And by that statement, my mind chanegd INSTANTLY. I sent her a message, a last one. I told her :

""I know how much I hurt you and I'm sorry, but apologizes habe no meaning without changes. I think the love is not dead, just off. And I understand how selfish it was of me trying to get you back in a relationship where you weren't actually happy and drained. Tho, we promised each other to love forever. And to proove you how much I love you, I am ready to finally let go and heal on your side. I've decided to put actual efforts to be a better person, for myself and my pairs. You will probably focus on your flirt, but for me it means a lot, and I know I am still an important person to you. By now, I will stop drugs and drinking, try to fight depression, bpd and ed. It will not be easy, but i'll do it. I still got some hopes that, one day, you will see again the girl you started dating, the girl that you loved. I will really have a talk to my therapist and never miss my meds. And I will do everything I can to treat mmyself like you treated me. I choose to stay single, because I know I will never forget you. Heres my number. We still have friends in common. If in some years, after healing, you still feel something for me or try something new, i'll always be free. I let you space, you will probably need to explore relationships to rest and feel loved, and it's understandable. If you find the love of your life, I will not disturb your peace. I realised how much I have to love myself before loving someone else, and thank you for that. Thank you, because with you, I feel loved, and I hope your next gf will treat you like you treated me. ""

  
Afte that, I started eating again thinking about how proud she would be if she saw me. I stopped drugs to avoid increasing bpd or depression and stopped haming myself in any way. And seeing my body through her eyes was an experience I never thought I would do. I always told myself that the girl she loved needs to be protected. It's been almsot 5 days that I feel ""great"". Well, I still stalk her and her flirt a little, but would never interact. I'm scared that it's a kind of euphoric phase, and then I would try to kms next week or the next day. I still miss her a lot, she means the world to me. And I wish her the best.

But if we could be back together, both ready, in great conditions, I would live my dream. 

Does anyone think this state of mind is great? Some people told me to live for myself, but since I hate me, I prefer to rely on something I know will never change : my feelings for her. And maybe... Do you think I can get a chance with her? Like.. In some years? I'm praying for that, I want to show her the love I kept hiding in my heart...

1mmn025,Thinking about FP ALL DAY alternatives?,"As soon as I wake up, he is the first thing on my mind, through the whole day I think of & fantasize about him, to the end of the day when I go to bed and I'm imagining being in his arms.

I'd quite like to be a mentally & emotionally healthy person 😅, and I've felt & thought this was about a person before, and when it hasn't led to a relationship I've had a mental & emotional meltdown that sets me back (can't function, don't want to do anything sort of thing). I don't want that to happen again, but ofc it's still normal to desire and pursue a person (in a healthy way).

I'm trying to balance this between focusing on looking to myself for love, attention, validation and also 'desiring' myself, which actually feels good to know I love and want me. 
But also I don't want to resist the thinking/fantasising too much (coz resisting is kinda exhausting, and the spiritual folk say its counter intuitive, you gotta 'allow') so I try to turn the fantasising into healthy intentional 'manifesting'. When I say 'healthy intentional' I mean envisioning in a healthy way a life and relationship with this person that is healthy (meaning: not expecting him to worship the ground I stand on, remembering he is his own person with a life and other loved ones, friends etc. And also not fantasising/envisioning the entire day on him, also focus on my other needs and being open to the possibility he may not ever be mine).

1mm6udz,My new therapist is brushing off my interest in BPD?,"Hi y'all. I'm hoping someone can help me with this situation. 

I have a new therapist that I've seen twice now. She seems nice but we don't really know each other. In our first session, she asked what my previous therapist and I were working on. I told her some stuff and said ""my previous therapist and I were just starting to bring up/talk about BPD. I think I have BPD and definitely want to talk more about it later."" She said okay and we moved on. 

In our second session, I told her I think I have BPD and would like to look into it further. She asked why I think I have BPD and I told her: I relate to 6 of 9 criteria for diagnosing BPD according to the DSM-5. My entire life I've always severely struggled with relationships and social interactions. I have always felt so incredibly alone and empty in this world and nothing can make it better. I'm impulsive, have a hard time controlling my intense emotions, etc. I also told her I always thought something more was wrong with me (besides GAD & MDD). 

I have been thinking about BPD for atleast a year now. It always pops up in my head off and on when I'm having a hard time. But I've never told anyone. My previous therapist actually brought BPD up on her own, shared an information page with me, and asked if I relate to it. I definitely did. Unfortunately, my old therapist left for a new position so we couldn't further discuss BPD. 

After sharing my thoughts about having BPD, my new therapist said, ""Well... I think of BPD as an attachment disorder."" And then gave her thoughts about what she thinks BPD is. She seemed to dismiss my interest in BPD and possibly being diagnosed. I don't remember how, but she changed the topic and we didn't talk about it after that. 

I understand BPD is a spectrum and that it manifests differently for everyone. And that I'm not a mental health specialist or well educated in the topic, but I truly believe I have BPD or that I am strongly exhibiting symptoms. I thought I had finally found something I related to and could put a name on. I thought that if I knew what was wrong with me, I could better treat it/try to get better. But now I am doubting my thoughts and feelings. 

After this interaction with my therapist I feel like maybe I'm crazy and trying to make up things that aren't there. I just feel confused and weird. Should I stop looking into BPD and BPD specific coping skills? Am I looking too much into things? Does it seem like my therapist dismissed me or am I overreacting?

1mmgygx,What should I do,"
i apologize if my english is bad, eng is not my first language.

my boyfriend and I (both 22) would get into an argument atleast every week or every other week. 

I know I cannot control myself when I get mad (I'm not physically abusive) but we always get into verbal arguments. And mostly me shutting off. 

But the issue has been recurring since last year, him always randomly sharing his past relationships/situationships and he would always talk about them lovingly, the nicest way, ""they meant the world to me"" and mostly about that. I've never heard him talk bad about an ex even if he has an ex who doxxed him/tried to harass me. He would always say he genuinely loved them. 

It is obvious that I always get uncomfy when he brings up stuff like that. Not that I'm insecure but I feel like I get scared (trauma response) due to my past and I tried to explain that it was disrespectful to always share moments like those with current relationship especially someone like me who is obviously mentally unwell. He called me ""immature"", ""insecure"" and ""crashing out"". 

I know some of my responses were very dry at first but no indication i was angry at him at first, just me being dry. And when I explained what I feel, he made it feel like I was the one who was insensitive. Said ""am i signing up for emotional abuse?""
> he knew about my pasts relationships, that it left me traumatized
> he knew i had attempted due to relationships
> he knew i am very mentally unwell
all these before we got into a relationship, I even warned him about me and my tendency and how bad my mental health is but he still pushed through.


This is hurting me so bad, he told me I'm an emotionally abusive gf, tbh if I really am I want him to break up with me. If that's how he sees me as, always an emotionally abusive gf. He says that and doesn't tell me he's breaking up with me. It's hard for me to breakup and I wanted him to do it but he won't do it even though he says im abusing him.

1mmm5jw,Is this Dissociation my BPD?,"Hey everyone, I’m not really sure if this is related to my BPD, or if I’m facing something separate here, I’m hoping if it is part of the BPD, maybe someone here can relate!

Ok, here we go.  To sum it up, I’ve been aware of my trauma, cptsd, and bpd for many years now, and have actively been trying to work on it.  But earlier this week I had a dissociative experience that was on a different level than I’m used to (at least that I’m confident I can remember).  I’m left feeling a little more than confused and anxious for what this means.

Getting into the details of it all.  I’ve been in therapy, consistently on medication, in and out of php’s, the general works.  It also is worth noting that I’ve been learning about DID to better understand and support some people in my life who live with it, so I have been reading about dissociation. 🤷‍♀️ The other day, I stumbled across an article written by a woman with BPD, whose inner child went from being an innie to an outtie, after spending more and more time with her boyfriend.  Because of how safe she felt with him.  I related MORE than I had expected to, or was ready for, and it felt like my entire brain/body….glitched? I’m not sure exactly how to word it, words are not my specialty.  But I felt myself lose control of my body, like the connection was severed, and I could feel myself kind of falling back into a (familiar) large dark room with a large cage in the middle, which I now was laying in the center of.  It was like I could see perfectly clearly, like a movie, this room filled with versions of me, at different ages, in different emotional states/mindsets.  Some were as young as me at 4, others had taken on traits of characters I identify with from tv.  Some I couldn’t really see their details, more of a general presence. But I could tell they were all some version of me.
They had a lot to say, and I mostly just laid there and listened, too exhausted to move, but I could also see/feel my body, even though I lacked control.  I was primarily laying in my bed (in the real world), holding my head and trying to find a way to soothe myself. I know I also tried to communicate with someone that I got triggered and was struggling.  Unfortunately, I didn’t do it in a constructive or useful way, and while I don’t remember exactly what my message said, I know it only made things worse, leaving the other person feeling terrible. I wish I had just gone silent, anything other than me causing pain, fear or anxiety to somebody I care about.

Over time I was able to regain more control.  In my brain it felt like I was waking up inside the cage, and that didn’t even happen until 4 days later.  But the versions of me aren’t gone.  They aren’t all the same ones hanging out, it changes around.  But it’s been 7 days now, and I keep going back and writing out everything I’m hearing/seeing in my brain as it comes.  No thinking on it, and no going back to edit it to make more sense (except maybe some grammar or typos), just let the dialogue OUT, and it really does read like a big conversation.  And the stuff coming out is referencing things that have happened to me throughout different parts of my life and they’re each piping in about how they were involved at those times.  And how they feel about the things that have happened since and who’s responsible for what.

I know that before this happened I knew I could BASICALLY hear the many different trains of thought in my head, and all with their own voices, inflections, and mannerisms.  But not in a hallucinatory way, more like if somebody was watching tv in their room, but the rest of the house (the outside world) can’t hear it.  I cannot tell if that makes ANY sense, but I can always tell it’s inside my mind, not an auditory voice.  I also know that there have been different points in my life where the “trains of thought” had been more clear than others, and I had even given a name to “the mean voice” in my head that I just attributed to my depression/self-hatred about 10 years ago. 
I’m also realizing just now as I’m writing this that I have had different people, throughout my life, comment that I act like a completely different person sometimes depending on who is around me.  Such as if I’m around my family.  Something I was absolutely not conscious of before they pointed it out.

I honestly don’t know if this could just be an aspect of BPD I don’t really know much about, or there could be something else going on in my head that I’m not eager to accept is a potential thing.  I know that dissociation is common in people with BPD, and I’ve known for many years that I sometimes dissociate.  But this felt like a next level of being clearly defined in my mind. 
I’ve had bad experiences with medical professionals in the past, so I’m hoping to gain a little more understanding and maybe some better language to more effectively communicate what I’m experiencing before approaching the doctors.

Has anybody else experienced this, and if so do you have any insight you might be able to share?  I greatly appreciate anyone taking the time and emotional space to read and consider this.  ♥️

1mmlqjc,Self Devaluation," I hate how I can take any situation and turn it around to where I convince myself I'm unimportant or an imposter. As a kid I was the leadoff batter in baseball but never felt deserving of that position. I can recall times as a kid where I felt nothing, I felt like a waste of space in this world and in people's lives.

 As an adult now, with two kids, and going through a rather unique divorce, she has primary custody but allows me to spend a lot of time as a family. When it's my time with the kids she will spend time with us, but will always take other plans if they present themselves. Her and my kids are always my primary preference but I hate feeling like I'm the backup option when it's my time with the kids.

 When I'm with her she will text other friends, but when she's with those friends she doesn't like to take away from their time and therefore doesn't care much to text. 

 I feel so unimportant. Like a waste of space that's only around when convenient. 

 I'm somehow not even upset with her but rather upset with how it makes me feel. This has always been the case and I would always take it out on her rather than calmly talk through my emotions with her. I'd spiral and explode rather than sort through my thoughts and emotions first and calmly discuss when I'm in a better headspace. Obviously this has largely contributed to our demise.

 It's like I want her to feel the same way I feel. Rather than just sharing my emotions I have to make her feel them too. I have felt worthless my whole life and for some reason felt the need to make her feel the same way, even though she means the most to me and I don't feel that way toward her.

 I just want to feel heard and understood and valued. I want to have myself believe I am.

1mml8yq,my life is falling apart,"I was finally free of my mom for a short while. I had peace and quiet. Within an hour of coming home she berates and screams at me. I'm never going to be free of her.

She told me that my girlfriend is going to leave me soon. She said one day she'll realize how awful I am and leave. I messaged my girlfriend begging her for reassurance and she just hasn't replied. What could this mean other than that my mom is correct? I don't even blame her. I don't fucking deserve her. I deserve nothing but the worst. I deserve to suffer and suffer.

Soon I'll get a breakup text. The only person in my life who doesn't scream at me will be gone and it's my fault for being so horrible in every conceivable way.

I was doing so well, I had been doing so amazingly, I had been. Then I got it all ripped away from me. All my hope destroyed. I am disabled and worthless, I'm never going to be able to move out. Even if I do I'll be a financial burden. So what's the point? Why do I even try.

More and more I just know I was meant to suffer. I've done too many bad things. I've hurt too many people. My girlfriend vents about me to one of the people I hate most and can I even fucking blame her? I don't deserve anything. 

All I can think about is relapsing. I work today but I don't think I can. I'll go to work at least. Maybe when the inevitable happens I'll have more money to leave behind for her.

I just don't know what to do. I keep fucking up. I thought reaching out for reassurance after all the horrible things my mom said to me would help. But it's been twelve hours since I did that.

She had eneded things with me, I believe as he didn't leave when she asked and unfortunately as she is one to probably allow people to change her mindset about things and her own BPD of fear of being alone and could it be she's never had a caring, good relationship and being with with me too much in that way? 

Considering all of that, would you ever think that she may eventually contact me in the future? Although I guess no one can say, I'd like to think so due to how much I do believe we did like each other very much, and the situation didn't allow it.

1mmk8zo,How do I stop being romantically shut off because of things my bf did with other women he dated?,"Sorry if this post is jumpy and all over the place I’m in such a bad mental state right now.

My boyfriend is older than me by 6 years, we’re both adults so I understand that he has done a lot of things with other women, I’m not that delusional. 

However because of the fucked up past love life I had I became romantically reserved up until my boyfriend made me feel comfortable enough to start being romantic again, but finding out that he did a lot of things with other girls that I never got to experience hurts.

I don’t know if it’s because I was in a long term relationship for 5 years and my ex didn’t do anything for or with me or if it’s because I’m genuinely jealous he didn’t do those things with me first. 

For example, my boyfriend carved pumpkins with his ex, I never got to carve a pumpkin with anyone I dated even though I wanted to. But because I know he did it with an ex I don’t want to do it with him anymore because knowing he did it with someone else ruined it for me. 

It hurts knowing I’ll never be his first for literally anything makes me angry. He says he wants to marry me but literally anyone could be a wife so that’s not really not special to me. He told me when we first started dating the ex I was “competing” with was just someone he was talking to because he was getting older and didn’t want to be single for the rest of his life. So yeah, when he talks about marriage all I’m thinking about is him just worried about being single forever.

It’s got to the point where I no longer want to do things that I know for a fact him and his exes did. It doesn’t even matter what it is. I simply don’t want to do it. 

I’m so stuck in my head that I have a genuine hatred for recycled relationship material. I’ve been on 3 dates my whole life and I would NEVER take him to those same places because I don’t want him to think I’m recycling dating material. 

I don’t know what to do. Sometimes I feel like it’s just best to leave because he doesn’t deserve to be with someone who doesn’t even want to go to the same drivethru an ex and him went through once in a rainy afternoon. Hell, I’m pissed off that an ex of his and I have the same favorite color.

1mmez6p,i am no longer obsessed with my FP. i feel free from them for first time in a 2 years. i feel SO RELIEVED!!!,"TLDR - long post but i tried to off myself a few days ago, im in a ward rn and i can proudly say that for the first time in 2 years i do not have THAT all-consuming feeling for him (u guys will know what i mean). i think rotting in my house forweeks & weeks obsessing over him pushed me over the edge along w everything else. but that feeling with him has GONE and i want to cry with relief. i dont care if i see him again or what he’s doing (other than i feel deeply sorry for the brainwashed virgin women he will prey on but i shouldn’t dwell on it) but I AM FREE  🎉🎉🎉  i AM going to get better and i will not abandon or degrade myself again! i can do this and i will get better. i am so so so appreciative that the feeling from him has gone!!! another plus is my autism stops me from remembering peoples faces so i cant even imagine what he looks like anymore lol. 

anyway no one has to read this but it helps me to share. i was in a horrible relationship for nearly two years. I was a VERY naive, inexperienced girl (just turned 19) when i met him - he was only a year older but had so many accomplishments, dated so many people, travelled, so many jobs, etc etc. He was obsessed with my innocence and I used to think he was a god and relied on him to learn about life. I remember seeing in his journal he had a “pros and cons” list he wrote to decide whether to pick me or the girl he was currently dating (i had no idea i was seeing someone else at the time). his pros for me were “she is innocent and pure” and his cons for his ex were “high body count”, so he chose me. He came from a culture/ family where purity is the main factor in relationships, so i was his perfect “wife” - completely inexperienced in life, autistic and naive. He abused me at the start of the relationship (i won’t go into detail as to not trigger anyone) & would convince me that it was my fault he behaved this way because i had lost my virginity to someone he viewed as below him. He made me feel so dirty for sleeping with someone else but at the time I was hypersexual with him so it was a never ending cycle of shame. He was completely obsessed with me and viewed me as his literal baby - even saying I am like his own daughter. He did many bad things to me and would apologise briefly - then say it’s my fault for neglecting him. The thing is that i’d go to my mom for advice but she has always been in abusive relationships too and would also fall for his tricks. he did something VERY bad to me at the start of the relationship and I sobbed to my l sister pleading that he will convince me he didn’t do it - the next day, he did and i blocked it out until recently, where it plays on my mind a bit ab how bad it was bc I no longer see him as the god i thought he was. he is just a very intelligent VERY privileged man, who knows how to get whatever he wants in life. 

I never realised I had BPD until a while ago and I reflected that I was mutually abusive towards him without knowing. He would have to sit with me for hours and explain what I did/said wrong, then I’d go back home and not understand. Id promise him that i’d change but i didn’t truly understand how or what i needed to change - i was just SO desperate for him to stay so id agree to anything. He loved me so much and i understand that it must’ve been hard for him to be told over and over promising to change but i wasn’t doing it. He said his abusive behaviour was because of me so he’d drink and “lash” out. He was even addicted to drugs bc he couldn’t stand being around me bc i was so insufferable. It’s so embarrassing to admit this but ik you guys will understand but when he would try to leave me, Id spam his phone for hours, send emails, call off other people’s phones, make loads of fake accounts on all social medias to beg him to come back (which he would mock me for endlessly) but in my head, this was normal behaviour and all i knew was that i needed him. I have finally come to the conclusion that both of us were bad in the relationship, even though he will forever blame me but i am okay with that now. i sent him this massive email basically blaming myself entirely and taking accountability so he won’t ever learn from his actions but i can’t undo that. 

Anyway, i was actually the one who ended the relationship bc i realised i had NO identity other than him and wanted to create a new person but in an unstable way, aka plastic surgery, name change, etc etc. Within a few days, he was over me and already living his life. and had found a new feminine (in his words i wasn’t a feminine woman like his mother), educated (bc i never got privilege of that) and completely VIRGIN PURE woman. I said to him how can he actively seek virgins when his body count is abnormally high. his response was “i don’t want the hole where my children come from to have had disgusting men inside”… i said that’s misogyny but then got mocked as a delusional feminist????? 

Even though I knew he moved on, I became insanely obsessed and would harass more than ever to the point where he said if I ever contact him again, he will tell my entire family and humiliate me. At the start of the proper breakup, he used to also purposely answer my calls bc it would give him an ego boost to laugh at me crying on the phone and tell me how no other man will ever want me bc of what i’ve done with him and im going to be lost without him because my family is so unstable and how great his life is without me and id sit and listen to him because i was so lonely. It makes me feel gross that I’ve fed this man’s ego but i cannot go back in time and undo it, can i? i would not sleep for days and when i did sleep, i’d wake up literally shaking in fear because he had gone. I felt like someone had died, i’d sob all day every day until my skin became raw. i tried to beg everyone around me to save me but then i’d push them away and treat them badly bc i felt unworthy of help at the same time lol. but now i am free of him. i felt like a genuinely scared lost little girl and i hope i never feel that way again! i will get better this time.

1mm7u28,Dating turned me into a stalker and led to a BPD diagnosis...Help,"I’m a 27-year-old woman who started using dating apps this past year, after having little dating experience before—aside from a few dates + a hookup, when I was 22.

Earlier this year, a psychiatric nurse told me I showed signs of BPD.

I went to her because I was having emotional breakdowns over a guy (age 28) who said he didn’t want to date me — but we stayed involved for nearly a year. It was messy, confusing, and way harder to let go than I expected. 

I don’t regret getting a professional opinion. In fact, it gave me language to understand my patterns — the intense emotions, the fear of abandonment, the all-or-nothing thinking — and how, if left unchecked, those patterns could spiral. Learning that other people experience the same cycles made me feel less alone, but also made me realize I had to take ownership of my part in them. 

 The angry text rampages, the swings between caring deeply for him and believing he was out to get me, the calls to his workplace, and the Facebook messages to his sister months after he’d told me we should have no contact.

She said there’s been some red flags that have stood out to her. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Does anyone else know how similar the symptoms of BPD and autism are?

1mlzj0h,"Discovered my BPD before getting diagnosed, somehow managed to tune it down a bit.","Hello. I've been recently diagnosed with BPD, but it wasn't much of a surprise to me. What was a surprise to me is the fact that I was able to correct my behaviour at least a bit even before starting to take medicine.
So, I've had problems with emotions (explicitly anger) for a long time because of my emotionally abusive mother (she also can get mad about the stupidest thing). That affected my life a lot. I wasn't able to have many friends because I would easily get aggressive and borderline abusive towards them (I don't say it's normal, of course not, I shouldn't have done that) like literally trying to strangle them.
Nowadays, despite taking the medicine, my mood still can easily change and does so in a matter of seconds (literally, like, one second I'm sad, another one I'm happy) and the fact that I'm depressed doesn't help.
Now with that out of the way, about my achievement. I've been friends with my ex classmate for around a year now and he's been nothing but supportive, kind and understanding towards me despite all of my problems. The thing is... he himself suspects he has autism. And, to be fair, he does act like it. He often doesn't understand what to do when a person feels one way or another, for example. Now, I'm not blaming him, but when I didn't understand his problems with understanding, I could get mad at him for not ""supporting"" me when I needed it. To him, he was supporting me by trying to find a way to deal with my problem, while to me it didn't seem like support and I got really upset and angry at him. I was very wrong. After a few times of explaining to him what he should do when I specifically feel upset in certain situations, he actually got much better. And then it hit me. He was genuinely trying to help and I was just acting like an entitled brat. So... I tried to do something about it. And it... kinda worked. Now, whenever he does anything that upsets me, I no longer start viewing him in negative light and rage at him immediately, but instead try to calm myself down even if just a little bit and actually listen to what he has to say and why he acted a certain way. Although I still sometimes get angry and can't fully control myself... I think it's a small win. So, to whoever struggles with BPD - you can make a difference. I know it's hard and not everyone can do it themselves, but it's possible. So, I believe that you'll get better.",1754771631.0,7,2,BPD,bpd

1mlth6w,Being in a relationship has become my only ambition in life - advice?,"Hello,

This is my first post here so I do apologize if the formatting is off. I'm 20, and I was diagnosed with quiet BPD last year. I have since tried various kinds of therapy and tried Lamictal, which caused a lot of mood problems for me so now I only take Wellbutrin for my depression and binge eating. 

I used to have all sorts of dreams and goals as a child, but as I got older my only hope in life has been to be a wife and belong to someone one day. I was constantly neglected as a child which led to me living a very sheltered, quiet life. Ironically I've never been in a relationship before and have little dating experience. I get so deeply attached to people I meet at times and I found that I was constantly being drawn to men who have very nonchalant personalities and are avoidant, who in turn would take advantage of me because of my inexperience and willingness to be tied down. So I stopped dating or trying to meet people entirely to avoid having a favorite person that would eventually hurt/abuse me.

I'm very exhausted. I feel like sometimes there's no point in pursuing anything else in life if I'm just going to be alone. Especially lately I've fallen into such a deep depression and I just can't stop spending money on random comfort items (self care, food, etc) and just bed rotting and crying nonstop. I'm trying to start DBT but there's hardly anyone in the area that specializes in it and I'm not sure how it would help me. I hold so much self hatred because of my inability to form a healthy, genuine connection with someone... I feel like I'm the fool for falling in love and changing myself for people to love me, even though I've never really made the first move and all my attempts at dating were initially started by the other person.

To an extent I do aspire to be physically fit and healthy, and I'm always trying to invest in my looks, but everything I hope to do ties back to finding love. I wanna be skinny to be found attractive, I want to solo travel more and get into certain career fields in hopes of finding love there, I'll even pick up hobbies that someone I like is into to share that similarity with them. I feel so hopeless and sad and I wonder if others have a similar mentality, and whether or not they were able to break free from the cycle. I want to be confident and prioritize myself but it feels so hard to feel valuable and worthy without ever feeling loved by another person. My only source of comfort nowadays is smoking weed and sleeping my days away to not feel anything.

  
Any and all advice is appreciated. ",1754756504.0,13,4,BPD,bpd

However, the last few weeks she’s been inquiring more about my health and well-being, and has been telling me she doesn’t want me doing certain things because she’d “be worried about me.” Even more she’s barred me from certain social events with our friends (that I get along with and know well) because of this concern for my safety. Social events that she herself is attending, mind you. To an extent it feels genuine, but it also feels either controlling, an excuse to not have me around, or both.

I didn’t want to just hang out without us trying to get back together. At first he tried to say things like we need time and space to come back together. Then three weeks ago i called him because i missed him and i noticed he hadn’t been reaching out often. He was really cold and then told me it hurts to talk to me because he’s upset we aren’t together. Then he told me how much he misses me, how everything reminds him of me, how talking to other girls aren’t the same, and started talking about this girl he’s talking to. He told me they slept together but he thought of me the whole time and how he can’t cum during sex anymore. He also told me he thinks we can work things out.

1mlpmr8,'safe' doesn't provide the 'safety' that i'm familiar with,"i recently went to grab a coffee with a guy that i've met on a dating app.

when i matched with him for the first time, i get the sense that he wasn't engaging in the conversation, so i decided to drop it. however, he decided to reach out a couple of times for a month, so i decided to try again.

the chat was lukewarm at best, and i was tempted to ghost him again. however, i got intrigued with how he responded to my bluntness:

when he wasn't being attentive enough:
""i wish this conversation is a two-way street,""
""oh okay, thanks for speaking up,""

when he offered to get coffee together, i said:
""i'm not sure if i could fully engage on the conversation, i just have a lot going on right now,""
""its fine, you don't have to be perfect 24/7, you do you. i'm not in the rush to find someone,""

and when it comes to talking about relationship:
""i dont want to navigate the relationship with ambiguity. i'd much prefer navigating this towards friendship instead of casual sex, sorry if that's what you're expecting,""
""no, i'm not expecting casual sex. we can just meet up and see where it leads us. i'll respect your personal boundaries, so i'm hoping you'll do the same. but do i interest you? is the important question,""

i know it seems normal to many, but i've had too many experiences where i was just placed as an 'object of interest' rather than 'a human', and that's why i didn't expect such a... humane conversation.

so, i decided to go. overall, it was a 6/10 experience, but that's the thing.

it was a 6 because it wasn't mind-blowing and left me with such a high feeling. the hangout felt like a text-book description of what 'safe' is supposed to feel like.

in real life, he's attentive, very respectful, and doesn't initiate physical contact (which i appreciate the most) and asked such sharp questions that it got me struck at some point. i've never had such an intense life discussion with anyone, let alone with someone from a dating app, yet it got me hooked. and the way he reassures me makes me feel light and easy. he makes me feel like i could actually do it. another thing is that he could actually see me for who i am, even when i've tried to be the normal functioning human being that i usually present myself as.

and that's when i realized that this kind of 'safe' isn't the kind of 'safety' that i'm used to. i'm used to highs and lows, surprises, short-term joy, and long-term aches. and now that i have found this, my system is asking me to seek 'stimulant' elsewhere because this feeling is not enough. this is not the 'safe' that i need. i know this kind of mindset is misleading, but how do i even navigate this?

1mm8vxw,I feel like I’m starting to split on myself and I’m alone and I fucking hate this,"Today was lowkey a good day until now. Chilled, went grocery shopping with my roommate, chilled again, made dinner late, talked with my boyfriend(23) on the phone while making dinner and eating. I just feel like something is wrong with me for having like some sexual fantasies with women (im 20 genderqueer AFAB) and have this fantasy of pegging someone, and my boyfriend is very against the idea of me doing it to him. Fine whatever. But when in passing I mentioned I’d peg a willing participant he got mad at me and was saying that I was basically saying I’d cheat on him. I wouldn’t cheat on him, I think cheating is disgusting. I just get so frustrated when he acts like I’m actually going to do anything like that and lets his insecurities take control.

1mm40wx,Do any of you ever struggle with differentiating whether you truly love someone or are just experiencing limerence and/or are lithromantic?,"So, for the past couple of weeks, I've been thinking a lot about my past relationships, crushes I used to have and have been analyzing my outlook on love and relationships and crushes and basically, I have come to this weird conclusion and I was wondering if anyone else with BPD could relate to this, or if it is just a me-thing.  
  
I always used to describe myself as a hopeless romantic. As someone who loves love. I could fall really fast for someone and I always dreamt of being in a relationship and finding 'the one'.  
But the longer I think about it, the longer I actually start doubting if I've ever truly been 'in love' with someone. I fear I may just be a lithromantic who suffers from limerence when they meet someone.  
  
I'd like to start with saying that I am very familiar with the term 'maladaptive daydreaming' and I love fantasizing about stuff and people. I have a lot of fictional crushes and when I meet someone that fits some points that I find attractive in someone in real life, I realise I usually already immediately start fantasizing about them, before getting to know them better. I build this version in my head of them and have fantasies and 'scenarios' with them that play out in my head and place them on a pedestal.  
  
Usually, when I get to know them better, sometimes, my crush fades, since they shatter some of the fantasies that I had built in my head and they fall off the pedestal I had placed them on and that causes me to lose interest.  
But then again, I do want to add that I also am diagnosed with autism and I think I have gone from an anxious-attachment style to a fearful-avoidant style, so when someone comes close or when someone reciprocates my crush, I feel this need to flee and/or I immediately like them a little less.  
A part of me really wants to be in a fulfilling relationship, find the one and be loved, but another part of me wants to run, when people start to get 'too close'. But I think a part of me, that has trauma from my childhood, is currently just obsessed with being 'chosen' and 'picked', rather than actually being interested if someone loves me. It's almost like I want to be in a relationship to prove that I am good enough, rather than actually liking the person for who they are. I love the fantasy version of them, rather than the person they actually are.  
And yet, when I get 'picked' and when someone reciprocates my crush or shows interest in me, it sometimes makes me cringe and gives me shivers and makes me want to run away. Probably because my head doesn't deem it safe, because I have abandonment issues and because I have no respect for myself and am used to being abandoned, so when someone likes me, I immediately look down on them for it, in a weird sense.  


I was wondering if someone recognizes this pattern. You almost like the idea of being in a relationship with someone more than actually being in a relationship with someone in real life, because no one seems to be able to match what you are looking for. Because you have these super-high standards, due to all this fantasizing that almost no one can match; only some fictional characters or because you know that having such standards makes it impossible to find someone, which is another way of protecting yourself.  
I don't know, I am no mental health professional. I thought I had been stable enough in my borderline to be able to date again, but this makes me wonder if I am truly ready.  
Everytime I meet someone I like and they reciprocate interest, I always run and break it off and self-sabotage.  
I am probably just scared to have to be vulnerable or have that feeling of being 'trapped', but yet, I don't want to stay single, either. It's very confusing and exhausting and it makes me wonder if maybe I am just a lithromantic who suffers from limerence when they meet someone and over time, it fades, causing me to lose interest or feel like someone is coming too close, which triggers my fight or flight.

1mm140v,"Recently divorced, spent most of the time thinking it was all my fault…","…only to start having memories flood back of the times I was taken advantage of or let down by my ex. TW: SA, infidelity, clusterfuck of a relationship 

I did some objectively shitty things during our relationship - early on there was emotional infidelity on my part and before I became better at regulating my emotions I’m sure it was a fuckin rollercoaster being married to me with some dramatic mood swings and walking on egg shells. But on the flip side of that, she would lie about everrrrrything, big or small, including about flunking out of her first two semesters of college. She also sexually assaulted me at least a couple of times (that I know of) by having sex with me while I was asleep. I caught her in the act one night but I have no idea to this day if it was something she regularly did or not. In addition to those, she was often cruel or careless with our pets and I basically had to teach her how to be a good pet parent. And I made so many excuses for her throughout this time and forgave her and tried to move forward but how do you move on fully from some of those things?

I’m just frustrated I guess that I’m of course the bad guy because I’m bipolar and have BPD and I’m the one who ultimately left her. But no one seems to care about what I was put through in the relationship. I lost most of my close friendships when I chose to leave her and I can’t help but think that it’s because I always gave off the vibe that we had an idealistic relationship when realistically it had been rocky for years and years and there was just a toxic chain linking us together.

Happiness, anger, sadness, everything is dialed up to 1000% and it's so difficult to stay composed. Just suppress it. Act normal. If you slip up, everyone will see you for who you are. Then they won't love you anymore. The more you grasp at what you don't want to lose, the more disgust they feel towards your presence.

But then... if that's what you're forced to do in order to have people love you, doesn't that mean YOU are not loveable? Everything hurts and seems like a loss either way. 

Even doctors don't want to deal with us. It feels like no one does, so where do we belong? Too dysfunctional for anyone, for anything, and for this world.

1mm1efo,argument with fp made him want to “build back up to wanting a relationship”,"i (19f) have been in an exclusive long-distance situationship with a guy (22m) for a while. we act like we’re dating, but he says he can’t commit because his ex cheated and he has a “fear of commitment.” he is aware that i have bpd. 

patterns that bother me: he’s vague about labels, hides parts of his social media/life, is most emotionally present when things are sexual or on his terms, rarely makes time for me, makes insulting jokes (“british humor”), and has lied about small but important things (like his name). when i’m vulnerable or express having struggles with the way he behaves, he’s often defensive or dismissive and claims i’m “always having a go” at him.

we had one argument where i told him it hurt when he replied “cute” to a message i sent while distressed. he said criticism “saps his energy” and now claims he needs to “build back up” to wanting a relationship, which to him means having “fun conversations” instead of addressing the issues. he also avoids “deepening” things and has never given me a thoughtful answer about how he feels. i have also called him out on most of these (the insulting and the lack of presence, as well as inconsistency.) 

he also brought up “not being used to being someone’s fp” as a point when i said i don’t feel like my absence would impact him. he said he’s independent and maybe that’s why it seems like that. he also repeatedly reduces my splitting to me being angry after being told that me splitting isn’t usually genuine anger 

my question: given his response to our disagreement and his overall patterns, how can i best decide whether to give him time to “build back up” or to walk away now for my own well-being? what factors should i be weighing when making this decision? what would you do?

But god almighty when anything makes me panic or afraid, anything that sets off my anxiety, I’m crying. Like ugly sob crying. I have to take bathroom breaks at work just to be able to cry without anyone seeing me. And sometimes it’s not the worst. Like I let it out for a few minutes and then I can recenter and ground myself. 

Other times, like literally right now, I just can’t stop. Nothing helps. I literally try everything while crying; working out, yoga, showering, dancing, journaling, crafting. Anything that might distract me like TV or podcasts, checking on basic needs- nap, food, water, bathroom, etc. Rarely does it stop the crying, let alone turn my mood around. Honestly, the only thing that works semi consistently is smoking weed, but occasionally it makes it worse. And I’ve also noticed cognitive decline bc of the amount I smoke. 

Does anybody have any advice on some coping mechanisms or techniques to help me pull myself out of these crying fits?

1mltunf,I'm wondering if I might have BPD- should I bring it up in therapy?,"Hey guys, 
I'm a 20f. I have noticed some patterns since my childhood that could be related to Borderline Personality Disorder. This might sound weird but I have skimmed through a good chunk of this community and holy shit I relate to a lot of it and I don't know what to do about it.

Here's a small rundown what I've noticed:
1. I have this innate fear of abandonment. It makes me want to push people away or beg them to keep me close. I can't seem to understand why that is.
2. I really don't have a lot of friends, I'm living in a different state because of college and honestly I'm having a lot of culture shock and I don't know if people don't like me because of racism or because I'm just unlikable but yea. I do have friends at home though, but I have lost a lot of people throughout the years. I think most of them would say that it was because I was ""tough"" to be with.
3. I have intense emotions, I feel as though I love, hate and feel sadness in a level that normally people don't feel. It hampers my understanding of certain basic emotional responses and it does confuse me a lot. 
4. I do have a tendency to be impulsive. I've indulged in a tad bit of substance abuse and alcohol and I have spent a shit ton of money on a lot of unnecessary things, mainly food? Idk why does food taste so good when you're sad?


I've noticed all these things since the ages of 16, which is probably too young but now it's more apparent. My ex (21m) pointed out all these things and it just keeps, clicking?
I am undergoing therapy for Depression and PTSD and potential ADHD (my psychiatrist didn't confirm it but he thinks I *might* have it?)

I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but I also don’t want to ignore something important.
For those who have BPD or have talked to a therapist about it, do you think it’s worth bringing up directly in a therapy session? How did you approach that conversation?
If you wouldn't recommend this approach, is there anything that could help me out?
 

Thank you for any and all replies. It really does mean a lot, I just want some help.

Thank youu :))",1754757419.0,3,8,BPD,bpd
1mlz3x8,should i message my former therapist?,"long story short, i need some advice regarding what to do about my current situation. i have been going to therapy pretty consistently since i was 14. i've had several different therapists throughout my life, which really sucks because i hate having to explain my trauma all over again for someone new. i hate feeling like i need to start over each year with a new therapist because they always abandon me. they move away, they get an internship somewhere else, they tell me i'm ""too much"" for them to continue treating me. every single therapist is temporary.

  
however, last year i started seeing a therapist who i made a lot of progress with. i opened up about certain traumas i have NEVER in my life spoken to anyone else about. i felt extremely attached to him, sometimes to the point the lines between therapist and friend would blur. i came out as bisexual to him, and that was the first time i had ever properly came out to anyone. so as you can probably tell, i was VERY attached and felt extremely comfortable with him.

  
sadly, i only did therapy with him for one year. back in may, he moved to alaska to start an internship and he said he would secure an appointment for me with a new therapist and he never did. i felt heartbroken and betrayed, like he purposely was trying to sabotage me. but now i don't care how angry i am at him anymore. i miss him and desperately need to speak to someone. i have tried for months to schedule an appointment with a new therapist but the system fucking sucks. my problems and feelings are URGENT, i'm not gonna be put on a waiting list.

now it's been a few months since i've last seen him and i just need to talk to him. there's so many different things that have happened in my life since then and there's nobody else for me to talk to. i've been thinking about messaging him on facebook since i found his account, but a friend told me that would be creepy. i'm thinking about emailing him instead then. i guess i just need some other opinions to see if this is worth doing, or if this is actually a horrible idea.",1754770557.0,2,0,BPD,bpd

1mlt2ip,Tried to seek help and left feeling so much worse,"I've been through a really tough time this last year or so. Yesterday, I had a bad ""episode"". I had to get home which meant driving, I genuinely don't think I should have got behind the wheel, but in that situation I had no other choice. 

I wanted to (but didn't) drive my car into a wall/off the road... I wanted to hurt people. I was driving in a very aggressive manner. I am deeply ashamed. I really scared myself. I haven't been that bad in ages. I am normally good at judging if I'm safe to go out or not, but this came on SOOOO suddenly and I couldn't shift it. 

Once home and in my safe place, I decided to try and turn it around. I journalled, I did some painting. I made sure I didn't text anyone - I am bad for almost seeking out arguments when I'm like this. I ask for support and if they can't meet my every whim I feel like they hate me and act badly. 

I then rang a local suicide prevention charity which was recommended to me by the mental health nurse. I got an appointment booked for the following day - today. 

I turned up, got lost but kept my cool and got there on time. But... I dunno, from the second she opened the door she felt kinda judgy. 

We went through what was happening etc. My long list. I was very open and honest and explained about how I act and I wanted help to try and keep me and others safe when this happens. Like how to help myself in those moments. 

I had written all this down because I know I forget in the moment. I have had so many services tell me I'm either ""not bad enough"". Well today I was told that they don't really deal with people with more serious issues. That I've already had CBT and what am I expecting? Therapy for years? She was super condescending. I took deep breaths and referred to my notes. I suggested that someone should mention to the south Perth community mental health team that they shouldn't refer people with XYZ issues. 

I could feel an ""episode"" coming on so said I'm just going to leave. She said no and actually walked towards the door asking me to stay. I tried. I shouldn't have. Everything is fuzzy from then. All I remember is panicking and repeatedly saying that I need to get outside over and over again whilst I tried to get out of the building. But it was a maze and I was getting more stressed and hitting myself (unintentionally) and crying. Repeating that I need to get outside. It felt like the walls were caving in. 

She opened the door and I ran out and found a bench and just sat there bawling my eyes out. I did some breathing exercises. After I dunno, 5, 10 mins or something? I had managed to fully calm down. I felt conflicted, I wanted to run. But I thought I should go back and apologise for having to run out like that. 

A different lady answered with a huge frown on her face. I said I was just here for an appointment with a different lady and wanted to apologise for how I left. 

She said that I scared her colleague and it was a huge over reaction. And she was just really angry at me. 

I feel awful. I am on a waiting list to see a phsyihiatrist, but it's the UK NHS, I don't know how long it'll be. I am desperate for DBT and am doing some exercises I found online and stuff. But I just really feel like I need support from someone actually qualified to help me. And I am broke, I can't currently work - I wouldn't be able to make an interview. I have dogs (my reason to live) and they have expensive vet bills. Like I am just trying to be a better person and now I feel like even more of a monster. ",1754755503.0,3,0,BPD,bpd

1mly49w,FP to bf to…FP and bf?,"I’m back (2 posts in two days crazy ik boooo)

My boyfriend, before we even started dating, was my FP (he had been my FP for almost nine months at that point) because of other circumstances, I had a major split (not because of him but he was, unfortunately, the little thing at the end that set it off).
After my blow up, we remained close friends (this was five months ago) I realized that my feelings for him were romantic, I just couldn’t see past him being my FP. We’ve been dating for two months now and I really love him and he loves me (he confessed he’s had a crush on my for months). 

Between my split and now, things have been going wonderfully. He works really hard to understand me (BPD + other disorders) and I work very hard to understand him (AvPD + other disorders). We set boundaries, triggers and each know the relationship skills we lack and are actively working together (and each separately in therapy) on all this.

I think he’s becoming my FP again. He’s been my favorite person since we started dating but I’m getting that dreadful gut feeling that I’m encroaching on Favorite Person territory. 

Is there any way to fight this/this feeling off? If not, should I tell my boyfriend? What boundaries should I set with myself and him?

1mlqvqa,Managing my BPD well… until the rage hits,"I 23F have accepted my BPD diagnosis for nearly 5 years now and been in therapy for 6. Last year I had my last therapy session. I know what my triggers are and how to somewhat deal with them. My relationship with my family (especially my mom) and boyfriend are the most triggering. I can reflect and things after and see when im wrong and own up to my sh*t. So i would say I have stuff pretty much in control. 

One thing I don’t have in control is when to stop when I’m so badly triggerd I go black. The BPD rage for me is really bad and I have thrown with stuff and got psychical with my boyfriend multiple times, I am ashamed of it but know it’s the a thing i still can work on. Sometimes I catch my self go angry and do not want to hurt him, so i hurt my self instead, hitting myself in the head till the feeling goes away and spiral in sadness until i go numb, hours after im kinda back to myself. 

I’m bad at walking away and cathing myself before its ‘too late’ and not restarting the fight, because I still want to prove my point. My anger is the one thing I haven’t figured out how to handle. I want to learn how to manage it and become my own safety net instead of relying on my boyfriend to walk away when things get bad.

1mm2m8o,I’m so so helpless,"
TW: suicide 

Hi, I don’t know where to begin with this. Please bear with me. 
I (20F) have been a long time lurker of this subreddit and while I am not officially diagnosed, I feel like I identify with a lot of the issues discussed on here. So, to be honest, I don’t know if this is just me being a horrible person.
I am really at a loss for words. The thing I want the most in the world is to be kind and genuine and loved and still, I do things that do not align with this mentality at all.
While I am usually friendly and respectful and most people generally seem to be okay with me, the truth is that I have not been able to maintain a single close relationship in my life. From friends and partners to family, I’m constantly disappointing the people around me.

Recently, I did some things that I knew were incorrect but did not seem like a huge deal to me. Obviously, those things significantly impacted some people I care deeply about and  I was unable to rekindle our relationship. I understand that I hurt them but things escalated so rapidly, everyone involved was vehemently against me and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to reveal much because I’m scared someone I know would possibly read this. My wrongdoing however, really wasn’t that big of a deal. In a desperate situation, I stole some food. I do get that for most people it is less about the action and more about the intent. 

I am so frustrated with myself. On one hand, I go out of my way to be a good person and give my everything to please the people in my life so I can get them to stay and on the other hand, I slip up and do something I assume I will get away with as it is not a ‘big deal’ and then it blows up in my face. This has repeatedly happened so many times and every time it takes place, I get incredibly anxious and unsettled and usually do something that makes things worse like lash out or completely withdraw and honestly, sometimes just attempt at ending things.

Am I just being defensive. Am I just a truly truly bad person trying to do the most to convince myself that I am good?
I am so shaken up by the consistency of such events. I am the only common denominator so I must be messing everything up. How do I stop being so difficult to love? How do I stop hurting the people around me? 
I am so sick of myself, I just want to stop being. She never lets me do good things the way I want to.",1754779773.0,1,9,BPD,bpd

1mlwfcd,Struggling to let things go.,"I met someone last year and it kind of ended in February this year. At first I thought things were going really well between us and it caught me off guard when he said he wasn’t ready for something long-term and just wanted something casual with me. I agreed, I felt safe to do that with him and there was part of me deep down that thought that maybe if we spent more time together he might change his mind (yawn). He obviously didn’t and I started feeling worse and worse about the situation as we weren’t spending time together like he said we would.

The last time I spoke to him a couple months ago he said he’d met someone that he sees something long-term with. 

Since things ended in February I have been so beyond torn up about it. I’ve struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember and there’s lots of aspects of my life that make me feel like I don’t want to be here but I can’t understand why I can’t get over this situation and why it drives me to the point of harming myself daily.

I had a well being team with 2 councillors which I saw once a week for 2 months to the point I was having 4 appointments a week. I am medicated too.

We started seeing each other just over a week ago and everything has been good I had a couple of small moments where I have been upset but other than that I have been good no splitting and I have had control of myself.

I have recently got my dream job and have just had a weeks work and I’ve been super happy and thrilled  with it and it has taken my mind off a lot of things.

I have a lot of problems with trust, had a very abusive dad growing up which is the main cause of my bpd and I also have cptsd. My partner cheated on me just less than a year ago and I have had trust issues with him since although I have tried my best to heal from it. He is going away to see his family over seas for about a month so I have been trying to get to a point again where I feel secure in the relationship to be able to have that time apart from him. I ended up self sabotaging the relationship and tried to leave before I could get hurt once again.

He is very supportive of me and I really do appreciate it, he also does a lot of things that do trigger me and he has mentioned that he is unable to change those things. I have said to him that it’s not fair on him to be in a relationship with me when I’m doing those kind of things to him, although he ended up sticking by my side because he loves me and he wants me to get better.

Last night I had 3 bad episodes one after another I would calm myself down then boom back to it this went on for about 4 hours. I hate who I have become and I hate seeing him be hurt by the pain I am causing, I am worried that he is trauma bonded to me and he refuses to let me go so that he can be happy and not have to deal with me anymore. He just tells me I’m selfish for wanting to do that, which I disagree with and I love him with all my heart I really do but it is not fair on him anymore but he is refusing to let go of me.

As good as it is to have someone that wants to stick by myself and be there for me to heal because I have never had that before , it makes me feel worse that I’m chasing him so much pain. I keep going up and down and up and down and I start to think I’m doing so much better then I crash again, every-time I am having an episode it makes me very suicidal because im still trying so hard to have that control of myself and last night I just couldn’t stop.

Does anyone have any advice for me that would help, I don’t know what to do anymore and it’s destroying me. Thankyou",1754772102.0,1,1,BPD,bpd

1mlz3ux,overthinking about my ( kind of ) boyfriend,"I wanna start this off by saying that me ( 19F ) and my boyfriend who technically isn’t my boyfriend again yet ( 19M ) broke up for around 8 months, were no contact for 6 and we’ve only recently come back together this month. We were previously together for 3 years, and there was a lot during that relationship that made me question my trust for him, and made me feel extremely disrespected and made my bpd a lot worse which is one of the reasons why we had to break up. This is something he’s profusely apologised for, and made up for as he didn’t actually mean to disrespect me and we have spoke this out many times especially before discussing trying again, but it did make me lose a lot of trust for him. 

Today, he told me that he’s ordered a privacy screen for his phone because everytime he goes to his mums, his mum looks over his shoulder at what he’s doing, which he doesn’t like and I know is true because I know what his mum is like and I know she’s done this before. However, this has genuinely made me completely spiral. My brain is convincing me of all sorts, that he’s got other people, that he doesn’t want me to know who he’s texting, that he’s gonna start talking to other people, it’s just made me completely crash out lmao😭 he’s offered to give me the passcode to his phone which he changed while we were no contact, and he’s said I can go through it whenever, but I can’t stop overthinking. He’s swore down and pinky promised me that it’s not to hide anything from me. 

He also made his following list on tiktok private while we were no contact too which is another thing that’s made me go crazy, I just don’t know what to do because my brain is genuinely sending me insane lmfao but I feel like I can’t overthink about this because we aren’t even back together yet🥲",1754770552.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1ml7j95,How to stop hating absolutely everyone ?,"I’ve always been a huge misanthrope and asocial person even without the splitting, the anger and the obsessions…but it has only gotten worse throughout the years. I’d say there are 3-5 people that I consider very dear to me, 2-3 that and I tolerate and I absolutely CANNOT STAND anyone else. If i’m in a good place mentally, I still generally get irritated by most people the rare times where I’m doing okay mentally but then I split and I get so much anger for humans. Their behaviors, their egos, it all pisses me off so much. 

This anger for everyone might be some kind of defensive mechanism because I genuinely think most people make fun of me behind my lback and generally see me as an and an inferior being. 

To be clear, I do not act on those thoughts at all. Quite the opposite, everyone is always saying how polite and nice I am but it TAKES a huge effort. In reality I do not wish to talk to anyone most of the time because I’m constantly splitting on people and hating humanity. 

And btw I do not haze people because I think that i’m better than them or something, quite the opposite.

1mlthoc,BPD and Other Co Occuring Conditions - How to Safely Accept It,"Hi, everyone. Putting this message out into the world and hope it's treating you kindly, despite it being more likely than not that majority of people with and without BPD are struggling. Content warning: sadly just a general one, but I mention the following topics that could be very stressful for people to read about:

a) medical gaslighting

b) seizures

c) surgery

d) being in denial about my BPD

In 2023 and 2024, I finally had my childhood autism reaffirmed, and found out it was because my parents were naive and took the advice that I outgrew my (at the time before ASD was all considered the same category) pervasive developmental disorder. I've been dealing with seizures since 2022, and haven't established the seizure type. Right now, I'm diagnosed with functional neurological disorder. I had major surgery for endometriosis after years of psychiatric abuse. I failed to get adequate acknowledgement when trying to seek legal supports due to how psychosis stigma affects people's ability to take my issues seriously. It's a constant battle for people to respect that I have adverse responses to specific medications and that it makes my neurological condition worse. Sadly, since it doesn't show on test results, people just assume I'm crazy or Munchausen's, thus putting me in a lot of danger when I have such bad meltdowns. 

I've lost a lot of friends and made countless mistakes in trying to have people take the reality of my physical pain seriously alongside my neurodivergence. I can't cope with the abandonment and constant demands to reframe, but I am seeking some encouragement and advice to safely embrace the label instead of distancing myself from it. I get caught in these traps where I feel obligated to tell people, and then they weaponize it later. Like I was convinced I was misdiagnose due to also being autistic and that commonly happening to people. I can't ""move on"" in ways that people expect because of the loss of some cognitive capacity and treatment options. I don't want to be in denial, ableist/sanist but at the same time, I feel as though I have a right to my privacy so I don't get mistreated. If anyone has advice to cope and not take on as much pressure to mask or have to tolerate people like <insert relative> for saying I fake my seizures because they're partial seizures and most people react poorly to difficult to diagnose medical phenomena, I'd really appreciate it.

1mlnwfl,"Need some advice, talked to my ex after I scared him to death. How do I manage my BPD to avoid this in the future?","So those of you who read my last post know that I really screwed up bad when I went to apologize to my ex when he was visiting our friends/my house. Usually he only visits if he knows I won't be there since he wanted to spend time with our friends, but he didn't want to interact with me.

Well, basically I screwed that up thinking it would be a nice surprise to apologize in person, but turns out all I did was trigger his mental trauma and scare the crap out of him.

But something unexpected happened.

He reached out.

It was just a text message with him saying 'Hey....its \*\*\*\*'

I immediately sent a long worded apology for everything, how I treated him that last week of our relationship and how I hurt him. How I apologized for being intentionally manipulative because I had this idea that I knew best for him. Apologizing for dropping in unannounced when he was trying to spend time with our friends.

It was hard because I really didn't want to apologize but my therapist told me 'You don't want to apologize, but you need to.'

He left me on red for a bit, and seeing the text bubbles from him typing was almost torture.

But what he said next, that hurt.

Heres what he said

*""Look, I'm glad you apologized but its hard for me to believe its sincere. You don't understand. Towards the end it felt liken you had already left the relationship and was just stringing me along. When you called me a liar for no reason other than I was delaying moving out because I wanted to afford a nicer place, that hurt. When you pressured me into buying you cigarettes after you claimed 'They were the only thing that stopped you from self harming' that hurt. When you ignored me on our last date and spent the entire time talking to friends but everytime I tried to get your attention you would look at me like you didn't want me there. That hurt. The worst part was I couldn't touch you because I was scared I was going to trigger you or set you off. I was scared because the last time I made you angry you just said so many mean things to me. I couldn't understand why you suddenly hated me so much. And when you dumped me by text, I just lost it. How could you claim to care about me but you dumped me in the most disrespectful way possible? How could you make it seem like you preferred your abusive ex over me? Because you broke up with him in person. But me you had to dump by text? That hurt.""*

*""I don't hate you, I hope you get better, but I can't be around you, some of the last things you said to me triggered me. Because you brought me right back to my own SA with how you talked and acted exactly like the man who did it to me. I'm trying to get over the fear of you, but its HARD. All the good memories I have of us all feel like a lie because of what you did at the end. And I can't look at you without associating you with him.'*

*'Please....work on yourself. Because I can't go through that hell again, and I won't. I may eventually be able to be an acquaintance, but I don't think we could ever be friends. I loved you, and you hurt me so much. And I don't want anyone else to go through that.""*

*""I found someone new, someone who understands me, please respect that, she doesn't want me talking to you, she knows what you did. Please don't contact me anymore.'*

  
The sad part is....he was completely right. He treated me like a princess, and maybe thats why I feel so guilty about it now. During my split, I treated him like crap. It wasn't until after he broke down and our friends called me out on my actions that I realized how horribly I treated him. And he was right, I made him think I wanted him and nobody else but then I left him just like that with no warning and suddenly.

He's got a new girlfriend now, and she HATES me. Especially after he told her about me 'surprising' him.

The worst part is my first instinct is to hate her because my mind tells me 'She stole your man.'

She didn't steal him, I threw him away. And In have to live with that.

1mldipd,Finding Out That I Have Been Manipulative and Emotionally Abusive To My Husband.,"Last week I was in a crisis and ended up in the hospital. Got out on Monday. Shit has hit the fan and my husband has separated from me and has taken our son with him to his parents. So far we are not getting divorced but I also have to work hard and get better. The ultimate goal is for all of us to be together again. Brief summary of my story: lost my mom to an overdose when I was 11 and I found her dead, my older brother was emotionally abusive even before our mom died and it got worse after our mom died, I have also been r*ped twice. The past 4 days have been an intense roller coaster. I am diagnosed BPD, MDD, and anxiety. After an intense convo with my best friend I asked my husband if I am manipulative and he said there have been times he felt I was and then I asked him if I am abusive and he said that there have been times he felt emotionally abused. I never realized this. He told me he knows I don't know I do it and so did my best friend. I have never intended to hurt anybody. This is not the real me. I am honestly broken and my reality has been shook. The guilt and the shame are so much. I don't want to be manipulative or abusive and I'm realizing that I have hurt my husband and that's not okay. I'm realizing that I don't take harsh criticism well because I was constantly criticised all throughout my childhood and teen years. My husband still loves me and shows me affection when he is around me but I just don't feel like I deserve it. I know I have to move on and better myself but I am in such a dark place that I am having a hard time handling it. I have cried so much over the past 4 days but today really took the cake. Losing my son and being slapped in the face with the hard truth of myself has me debilitated. ",1754704498.0,22,16,BPD,bpd

She got tgt with someone when she wasn't actively trying. I mean, she may have been looking to find someone, but not while playing sports and that's where she found her husband. So first tip: put yourself out there and genuinely try to have fun

2nd tip: love ourself. My daughter was initially ashamed of her bpd but I kept encouraging her and telling her that bpd is actually a superpower, being able to feel so deeply and empathising with people so much.

3rd tip: I also told her that anyone she loves is lucky. From my research, people with bpd are often addicting because of how much they can love. That's something anyone who is lucky enough to be loved by her should cherish.

1mlsik0,How to stop getting into arguments with loved ones ?,"Hello all- this is my first time posting here so do tell me if I'm doing things incorrectly 

I'm 27 and have been diagnosed with BPD a few months ago (by mail no less, but I guess that's just a funny detail at this point)
I've suspected suffering from this disorder for a while, but I sincerely hoped this wasn't what I was dealing with since BPD is still pretty misunderstood by the greater crowd, and people with this disorder have somewhat of a ""bad reputation"" (but honestly that kinda goes for anyone with any mental illness, right ?)- anyway, my psychiatrist is pretty much convinced, as well as other medical professionals, so I guess I must make my peace with it 

When I was younger I wasn't a conflictual kid, but socializing was very hard (I was very shy and other kids scared me) until I discovered that making jokes makes it easier to be liked by other people. So I became somewhat of a clown, and it did help me make some friends. 

As I grew up and worked my way through various severe depressive episodes, therapy helped me realize that the anger, frustration and sadness I kept bottled up inside were making my life harder than it could be. So I started voicing my concerns and emotions, in the hopes that communicating would make it easier to understand and be understood by people. 

Years down the line, I've gone from a funny mellow sad clown to an opinionated, sad, defensive and downright conflictual clown. When I feel disrespected and/or hurt, I get angry and can sometimes be very passive aggressive as well as contemptuous. It started with my parents, but now it also happens with other loved ones. 

What motivated me to write this post is that today, my best friend was feeling down on themselves (they also suffer from mental illness, namely anger issues, but aren't diagnosed with BPD), and I ""asked"" them (maybe a little too forcefully) to drink water (it went like ""You should drink some water. [best friend says no] Come on /best friend/!""). I don't know what's my quirk with water, but it seems like I communicate that I care for others through reminding them of drinking water (among other things). It's a weird harmless quirk, but I understand it's annoying to some. 

My best friend reacted by raising their voice and telling me that I was getting on their nerves. I immediately got on my high horse and started raising my voice as well, ordering them to watch their tone with me because I was simply trying to take care of them the best way I could on the spot. It was the second time this week that they told me I was coming off as aggressive when it wasn't my intention, and it made me angry at myself and them for not understanding my intentions. 

Inevitably, it ended with me fleeing the situation and letting them go home on their own while I went wandering in the streets & chain-smoking, trying to calm myself down. 

This isn't the first time something like this has happened. Like I wrote earlier, this has become my main way of reacting to conflict : raising my voice, getting upset, being passive aggressive and/or scornful, and ultimately escaping the situation and isolating myself to get the sadness/anger/frustration under control. I don't want this to happen anymore. It's damaging my relationships and my already shitty self-esteem. 

I think I'm a very caring person. At least, this is what I've gathered from most of my friendships where people have told me that I was a good supportive friend. I always take time to listen and support others, even people I don't really know. People find it easy to confide in me, and I let them because I want to offer my help in the way that people haven't when I was deep in the hole. But no matter how many efforts I make, I always end up coming off as an unstable shithead when things don't go as well as I wish they did. 

I try so hard to be a good person, because that's what I want to be. I want to be helpful, and a positive figure in my loved ones' lives. But I feel like it's not working, and that maybe I'm not meant to be a social person. Most days I think to myself that I should become a recluse and keep myself away from people, because I'm so bad at handling conflict. 

Do any of you have any advice..? I'd be very grateful. Thanks for reading my essay

TLDR : Despite all my best efforts to be a good friend and the reassurance of my loved ones, my bad handling of conflicts makes me doubt my ability to be in relationships. I want to get better at controlling my emotions, but I can't seem to get it right. Any advice ? ",1754754157.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mls9ky,Does anyone elses BPD make it hard for them to understand how others perceive their words?,"I (26F) always felt my ex boyfriend was too good for me. Well, after my last trip to a psych ward, my therapist asked me 'Do you actually love him? Or did you feel pressured because he said it first?'

All it took was that, and I thought about it and even though he was sweet, kind and everything to me.

BUT

I didn't love him, I don't know if I'm capable of it.

So I broke up him a week after getting out of the hospital. He didn't take it very well. I told him that I still wanted him to be a part of my life and told him

""I want you to find someone better.'

And that was all it took, he started crying and left.

I figured I knew he was hurting, but I genuinely believe he deserves someone better. And I think the breakup went well.

Only for my friend Helen (Named changed for privacy) to blow up my phone a week afterwards. She was the one who introduced me to him.

""WHAT THE HECK DID YOU DO?! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HURT HIM?!""

I was shocked, I knew my ex struggled with depression but apparently he had been having a really hard time accepting it.

I told her what I told him and I could hear her facepalm over the phone.

""Breanna.....NOBODY who thinks someone is a good guy says 'I want you to find someone better' everyone knows thats just a way to soften the blow. What it translates to is 'I want to find someone better.'

And then I started panicking because I didn't want my ex to think that I thought less of him or that I wanted to find someone else! I just wanted to live my life in a certain way that wasn't compatible with him!

I thought I was being nice to him telling him that when I broke up.

But apparently that wasn't the right thing to do. But the worse part was I sent screenshots of my exes and Is text conversations to defend myself. And then she was pointing out 'Breanna....literally everything you said implies that you wanted to find a better man than him.'

It wasn't him! It was me!

But apparently nobody ACTUALLY says that and means it",1754753536.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mljymz,Seeking support and a diagnosis,"Hi everyone, I’ve been lurking this subreddit for a few days now and I can say that all of you are lovely people, however with that I’ve been reading a lot into BPD and yes I know reading reddit, doing stupid quizzes and reading articles and stuff of that nature isn’t good enough advice.

I’ve become seriously concerned that I have BPD as I’ve been dealing with a lot of severe symptoms that match what I’ve heard, while it can also be C-PTSD I’m not going to rule that out as again I’m not a professional.

I’m a 19 and I’ve just moved out at home and I’ve been battling depression and an anxiety disorder additionally but things have started becoming unbearable mentally, having access to alcohol hasn’t exactly helped either.

I’m not sure what to do from now though, I don’t have the time in my work schedule and i simply I cannot afford to lose a day of work as I do a volunteer and study position too that’s detrimental to my future career, I’m quite frankly terrified of seeing a psychologist as mental illness is seen as a weakness and disgusting to my family and j don’t necessarily think I deserve it to be honest. 

Even if I am to see a psychologist, how can j bring this up to them in a way that doesn’t seem like I’ve either “self diagnosed” or I’m just being paranoid?

1mlrq0p,I’d like anybody’s perspective on this situation,"
Hi i just want to be told if i’m in the wrong here & if so, how?

There was a pride event in my town today & 3 people, friends, i met at a pride group planned to go. I hadn’t slept (which may be relevant but may also not be idk) but i decided to go anyway. Maybe i was tired and that’s why i (probably) overreacted and am more offended by this situation than i should be. Whatever, here’s what happened 

At 1:24pm i texted the group chat saying i was there, 10 minutes later H said they were here too, i said i’d keep my eyes peeled for H (dumbass thing to say lol) & i believe the other 2 were already there/on their way. 15 minutes later i messaged the chat asking if i was in the right place cause nobody had said anything & i hadn’t seen anybody yet. 

The layout of this place is it’s outside, it’s in a circular park so i was walking around the circular pavement while all the stuff was on the grass in the middle. I figured i’d walk until my friends came to find me since i was embarrassed to be aimlessly walking around the grass looking for them, i think i was in the wrong here as i couldve & shouldve looked. As i walked around the pavement multiple times i was looking in the middle trying to spot them though. 

Anyway 15 minutes after i asked if i was in the wrong place, H asked where i was so i asked where i was supposed to be & said i’ve been walking around. I spent more time walking around & sitting waiting for them but when they didnt reply, i did go onto the grass & looked a bit but i couldnt see them. I texted again & H said they were at one of the tents but how the hell was i supposed to know where that was? I did have an attitude in my texts to be honest i will admit that. H said “Well it’s near the edge where you’ve been walking And it feel like you’re annoyed which I don’t get” which just angered me. I got here an hour ago & none of you 3 told me where you were until i texted multiple times, i’m justified to be annoyed right? Right?! Am i being entitled? I srsly can’t tell :(

I figured If H thought i was annoyed, i figured that’d ruin the mood should i find them & i didn’t want to deal with the tension that i thought i’d created with my incompetence of not knowing where they were (in my defence, they didnt tell me for an hour of me waiting…) + i’d be embarrassed for taking so long to realise where they were so i’d be kinda reclusive & brooding the whole time. 

So i left the park without saying anything (i think this was dumb and petty of me). Then another person in the chat sent a picture near where i’d already walked, i literally did walk there 10 minutes earlier but didn’t see them. 

I’d left already so in response to that guy’s messages, i just said “Nah it’s aight i’ll leave” to which H said “Seriously?”. I said “Yup 😢 if i seemed annoyed to you it’d damper the vibe for the rest of the time” which is all i’ve said since leaving, i do want to apologise and explain myself but i feel like it’ll look like im trying to get pity and like im feeling like they owe me an apology when i dont care, they dont have to apologise to me and they can feel annoyed at me for this if it means we can still be friends. I dont like how difficult i was 

Anyway, to my message, H said “it’s fine it’s just we can’t leave because we’re all helping out so you’ll have to come find us” while i was standing outside thinking of how to explain myself but this message just annoyed me so i walked home. I waited over an hour watching to see if they’d come in but they were there in a stall helping. Why would i want to help? Why would i want to stand around there with you guys just for our conversations to be constantly interrupted by people coming up to the stall you’re at? You guys couldn’t leave the stall but couldn’t text me saying i have to find you? When i said i got there, they should’ve told me that, right? Right?! 

I should’ve went back in when they said where they were. They would’ve been looking out for me after sending me a picture of where to go, right? I could’ve found them & we could’ve had fun together. This is the first time i would’ve seen any of them outside of the group we go to. I am prolly not gonna go to that anymore (i might be too old for it now anyway but that’s irrelevant) cause if i don’t have to see them in person, i won’t, i don’t want to deal with the tension that is surely going to be there after they probably expected me to hang out with them today but i left due to my own frustration at myself for not knowing where they were

Forgive me if this doesn’t make sense. I tried to explain it with every detail. I just want an outsider’s perspective on this. If i messed up, how? What should i do?",1754752150.0,1,7,BPD,bpd

1mlj98p,I think I am a bad friend,"I am not diagnosed but I am in waiting line for a psychiatrist with a therapists' note. My main problems are emotional regulation and strong mood swings, and it affects my relationships. I have strong social needs and love hanging out with my friends often, but find that people in my life are not as interested in initiating hangouts with me as I am with them. I have lost most of my closest friends throughout life, some due to natural fading but also a few due to my instability of emotions. I lost a close friend that I was extremely attached to about 8 months ago, and one of the last things he said to me when we parted was that ""he couldn't handle the back-and-forth"". It felt like the world ended when he left. I want nothing more badly than good and close friends, but it is difficult to have friends when I am ill, and it is difficult to heal when I have no friends. Navigating life like this is so difficult, and it seems like I never get better no matter how much therapy and growth etc. Sometimes I feel like the world would be better off if I isolated myself so no one would have to deal with me and my emotions. But as difficult as my emotions are to other people, they are 10x as difficult for me. I don't know if I will even be diagnosed with this but I just wish I was normal, it feels like my brain doesn't work how it's supposed to.

I struggle to be independent, which I get it at my age is a huge turn off for nearly every woman alive. 

My family's issues pretty much guarantee me a future of debt and pain. It's funny sometimes you're better off not knowing your parents issues so early on.

Is this quality of life really worth living, or was my original analysis from my late teens correct.

There were things he was doing, like not taking care of himself and not showering and making an effort, which I thought meant he didn't care about me anymore, but I realised he was really struggling with his mental health and that was how it was presenting - difficulty doing basic tasks like that. I did try to talk to him about it, but I feel like I fucked up somehow, I wasn't supportive enough or didn't know the right words or something...? I'm honestly pretty confused about the whole thing. We were so good at communicating and then all of a sudden it just kind of fell apart. 
I don't really know what I'm asking... maybe someone has some insight into this relationship dynamic and where miscommunication can happen? Or maybe the kinds of things that are incompatible between these two disorders. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if there's a way for me to salvage the relationship. 
I've crossed a lot of boundaries trying to get him to talk to me. That's one thing I really struggle with - being shut out. I know this probably comes across as my own undoing, and maybe it is. I just wish there was a way for me to fix things because I love him so much and I don't want him to be in pain.
Thanks in advance for any help. And please be gentle with me, things are very fragile right now.

1mlcyyo,Living alone is making me hate my apartment??,"(For context, I've been diagnosed with BPD and ADHD. I strongly suspect AuDHD, though.)

In my early 20s I always lived with roommates but generally after a few months some sort of compatibility issue would always come up, causing me to exit or be forced out of houses and apartments.  Shortly after a very traumatic friend breakup/eviction situation, I ended up graduating college, moving to a more affordable city, and getting a high-paying job. Due to these positive life changes, I've thankfully been in a financial position to live alone for the past five years. For a long time I really enjoyed my single girl boss era and specifically avoided dating to ensure I wouldn't lose myself, but then I met my current boyfriend and from day 1 he's loved and supported me like I've never been before. We've been together now for almost a year and it's been so incredible and life changing to receive love that makes me feel strong but also stable and protected. 
The issue™️, however, is that because I've been enjoying my time with him so much, it's been hard to go home and just be with myself. I often end up indulging in mindless habits, like watching tv, eating for dopamine, or just plain dissociating. Lately I've been incorporating new coping mechanisms and productive activities like painting, yoga, exercise and reading, which have made me at least feel proud for putting in the effort, but I struggle to actually enjoy them and remain present. It's gotten to the point where just being home puts me in a bad mood. 
Any suggestions to trick my brain into appreciating my own space again? I would like to get back to a headspace that allows me to enjoy being by myself, but it literally feels like an uphill battle just to sit with my own thoughts and yearning for my favorite person's physical presence.

My family on the other hand, my parents r divorced and I live with my remarried dad, with my stepmom. They don’t care much about health issues and even when I bring up tummy aches and such, they js offer water, say it’s in my head etc. My bf’s family? They’d rush him to ER.

Now every time, I’ll be the first he tells me about his health problems, when he’s sick and such. This is my biggest splitting trigger, I’ll start telling him it’s his fault he has eczema coz he won’t stop scratching himself and I have no clue on how to maintain myself. I’ll tell him to keep it to himself and sneak around the house for medicine instead of telling it to his parents because in my head, it’s just not fair that his parents love him more than mine do, so he has to suffer with me. I know it sounds harsh and selfish but that’s why I’m here to ask for help.

I just had a huge splitting meltdown just now, over this. He had to leave for his eczema appointment coz his parents were forcing him to. I crashed out and started threatening to leave him because I hate that his parents care so much for him. I cried and cried and screamed like an infant for a good 3 hours.

1mlmhsn,"Struggling with isolation, regret, and the fallout","Hi everyone,

I wanted to reach out because I’ve been feeling really alone in this, and I’m wondering if anyone else has been through something similar.

There was a time when I completely withdrew from everyone in my life because I didn’t want to burden them with my mental health struggles. At the time, it felt like the only way to protect my relationships. But it backfired — I was the one who ended up suffering the most. Now I’m living with the consequences of that isolation: worsened symptoms, physical health decline, and feeling disconnected from who I used to be.

I’m trying to rebuild connection now, but it’s hard not to feel regret and self-blame for how far I let myself fall. I’m also dealing with chronic pain, exhaustion, and mental health issues (including BPD traits), which makes reconnecting with people even harder.

If anyone has been through a similar cycle — withdrawing, regretting it, and trying to rebuild — I’d really like to hear how you navigated it.
What helped you reconnect without feeling like you were burdening others?

That whole dynamic was incredibly taxing for both of us (and I don't want to downplay how I made him feel), but I feel like it's impossible for me to ever have peace. About two months ago it got to a boiling point and he couldn't handle the pressure anymore and so he doesn't want to interact with me at all indefinitely. And as if I wasn't feeling constantly suicidal before, now it is so so so so bad. Everyone telling me that space is good for us and it will make it easier but I still feel the same as the day he sent that message. And in the past I was so terrified of him doing this and he promised he would never just cut me off, at most it would just be some limits and boundaries, which I was understanding of (and he never did despite me begging for him to set boundaries because I could see how it was affecting him). And it's like it proved everything my fears were telling me and now it's impossible to shut it down because it happened and it has made me incapable of functioning on my day to day. Even if he were to come back, I honestly feel like it wouldn't matter because I am so hurt because I trusted he wouldn't do that and he genuinely made me feel like he had my best interest at heart. And I don't even want to go back to the dynamic of trying to convince myself that all the tiny things mean nothing and my brain is just acting weird because it's exhausting and now I don't even think I could convince myself. It's ironic too because he was so scared that he would do something wrong and it would cause me to kill myself, but I told him that's not how it works and listed what I needed from him to feel the most stable and if anything set me off that bad I'd talk to him about it. And now I can't talk to him about it. I'm sorry if this triggered anyone but I can't do this anymore and I'm tired of living. I know it will break my family and friend's hearts but I don't want to live a life in this level of pain al the time, and no amount of distraction and therapy and psychaitry and fucking making edgy paintings and songs have made it go away. Hopefully it's been long enough that he won't feel responsible.<3",1754722419.0,2,0,BPD,bpd

But things were finally starting to go good, I got a new job in a great kitchen, Ive been dating this gal from my old job. Amazing, the most caring soul with the brightest, beautiful smile I’ve ever seen, sometimes it’s not perfect but hey! open healthy communication and an actual feeling of love? Pretty great… (and very new to me.)

Until… the thoughts, she’s cheating, she hates me, this is all a game, she playing me. I broke down and freaked out after not hearing from her for the night after she instantly responded to my first text and ended it tonight in the middle of the night. She called later, she wasn’t yelling or crying or anything. She just listened, was there for me and still just supported me. I asked her if she was okay and she let’s just focus on me. 

She knows I have BPD and how much I’ve learned to live with it by myself. I haven’t done much research but I know the general things of what makes us, us. 

I tried to hang myself before I sent the breakup text. I feel so numb. She loves me, and I just ruined it. I’m so lonely in this city, I’m a line cook, I don’t have the finances or insurance to get help. 

Everyday my body screams at me to go back to the substances, the chase, the drowning out, hiding the pain in a glass or a line. I refuse to self medicate… though the refreshing taste of the land of sky blue water would be wonderful. I can’t…

I feel so overwhelmed. I don’t know where to go from here or what’s to come. She’s everything and then some. It’s only been a month and some change but we’ve spent 3/4th of the time together. I’ve forgotten what life was like without her and I don’t want to go back to it. 

Why does everything always have to feel like the worst case, the most intense feeling? My mother doesn’t understand, my dad isn’t in the picture. My friends are limited. I don’t want to do life alone, I really don’t, especially not after experiencing this with her. I met her parents this last weekend. What the fuck did I just do.
Why.
Why am I like this.

I know I’m not alone, I know others have experienced this. But why do I have to fuck up every good thing that comes my way? 

Why can’t I just be a man, strong. 
I don’t really want love and support from online strangers, I’m 25 I can find that and have it. 

More of what I’m asking, what would you do? I’ve been without meds for 3 years, I was priced out of vraylar, (which I’m not even sure was what I was supposed to be on.)

I don’t have insurance and I have 6 thousand dollars in debt with no savings. What would you do? How can I stay alive? How can I grow and be successful. Can I get her to trust me again? Is she just going to be another memory? I really don’t want that..

That’s how it works. You’d just have to come with me since I make the money and I have the car. It’s free for you man. 

I asked him last week if we could PLEASE go and he sent me a fortune cookie with something about going to on a trip on it and said “guess we have to now” which…didn’t feel good but okay. He hasn’t been talking to me much cause he’s “on his grind” with his fucking vr chat rps so I called him this morning after nearly a week of not calling. He said he’s going to the beach tomorrow with his fam…we’re going on Thursday and like…I’m not mad but like…gahhh!! I don’t want to go with him anymore. It feels weird and I feel resentful that he’d get to go on a free beach trip fucking twice in a week when I’ve been begging to go all summer.

(Attachment wounds that cause fight or flight when I feel i have done something wrong)

The reactions you have because you're afraid that you've made me feel bad are the very things that actually go ahead and make me feel bad. Does that make sense?"" 

i just feel like that was a weird way to comfort someone who's brand new to recognizing and seeking treatment for their BPD. 

I feel like he's blaming me for putting us in this ""vicious cycle""

1mljotd,idk why i feel dirty and oversexualised i need help,"TW: SA and Drugs

i dont want to go in details about all the times i was sexually assaulted but it happened multiple times in my life, from the age of 15 to 20. Im a 22 years old girl. what i will say tho is that from past relationships, i was compared to many pornstars, what i could do to be like them in bed (my first bf would do that all the time), to being pressured by changing my mind to be an of model at 18. If that sentence doesnt make sense : my first bf told me that i should actually do it because i was 18 and that age sells a lot on there. My first bf was a year and a half older than me. i guess i will say what happened in my past, i was raped two summers ago in some random people's yard, and groomed when i was 16, this relationship was on and off for years. 

I feel comfortable being extremely sexual with my boyfriend. i get uncomfortable when he asks me for threesomes, because it's something i was pushed into in the past, or me going way too much out of my boundaries to please my exes, because they either wanted to break up, or explore their sexualities.

i made it clear with my boyfriend that im not ready to have a threesome because of a lot of reasons that are  not only due to past traumas. he asks me a lot just because he's an impulsive guy, asks me on and on for a night and when he gets it, he's not disappointed and most of the time, just wanted share his fantasies with me. Now something happened yesterday that almost makes me feel the same way i felt after i was either groped or even raped, and its really not as intense as those experiences...

 Me and my man order stuff from this guy who has a driver who delivers to us. and she is a sweet heart, she's double my age, but when i had hard times with my boyfriend, she would text me all the time and give advices. at some point she was texting with my bf and told him that if he's not careful with me, she's gonna try her shot with me. Im really used to straight girls telling me they want to date me, saying they are extremely gay, but as soon as something a bit gay happens, they are disgusted at the idea of being gay, idk i see a lot of queer baiting but wtv my point was that i was sure she wasn't serious and just meant that she found me pretty! 

Yesterday, after she dropped our stuff to our place, she hung out a bit with us and she left later. she was being really touchy and sexual, even tho she was touching me (like my butt or my breasts) i really didnt take it as her hitting on me. she was also joking while doing those things. Anyways, i wasnt uncomfortable. 

The night goes by and she leaves. NOTHING SEXUAL HAPPENED, LIKE FLIRTING, JUST STUPID BOOBS JOKES. My boyfriend wants her to stay longer, just to continue the conversation, I dont want to, i get mad and he goes outside the house, to her car to ask her for a cigarette. I thought he was asking her to stay longer because that's initially why he went out. He comes back in, tells me he didnt ask her and just asked for a smoke. 5 minutes later, she knocks on the door, and starts kissing me on the mouth. I was so confused, she kissed me a couple of times, tells me she wanted to do that for a while, tells me my boyfriend is okay with it because she asked him first, and leaves. 

I really like her as a person, i know she was heavily intoxicated, but i felt really weird after. the feeling of being dirty wasnt there yet, but i felt like i cheated on my boyfriend. he asks me what she wanted and i tell him, she texts me and apologized, says she was out of place, i felt too bad and was still a bit in shock that i couldnt tell her i was feeling weird. i just couldnt. after, my boyfriend says that he just wanted to share the thought of me and her having sex and he could just watch. that's when i started to feel disgusting, i feel like im only good to be a girl to fuck and i put too much energy of wanting to please men that i feel dirty by all of this. i feel like im starting to hate sex. it's everywhere and i hear the same questions from all the guys who were with me. idk what i did wrong to feel like this and not empowered by doing it... i hope someone will answer me something ",1754725172.0,0,0,BPD,bpd

1mljef0,What can I do? Fears of relationship failure and cheating. Feeling lost and helpless.,"Been diagnosed with bpd since age 17. Had a bit of DBT and plan on starting again soon but need advice that will help me today or soon with work.

Me and my partner ( recently became my husband) have been having issues. To start off I wanna admit, I cheated twice… I also admitted it to him and apologized and haven’t done it since. We moved in together after a turn of events and shortly before he revealed ( I asked) that at a time he felt like cheating back. Time passed but I was caught in a loop of constantly questioning his loyalty and asking him if he felt like cheating, if he did cheat, asking him to promise he wouldn’t. Things got pretty bad for a while. Then he revealed to me that my constant accusations made him want to seek comfort else where. He was honest that he downloaded a dating app and didn’t make an account and deleted it. Told me the same day. I was hurt, but since then he says he hasn’t had the urges to cheat and hasn’t attended anything. I finally reached a point where I’m not always asking him. But I do still have this strong fear. I think it stems from the fact that I’ve cheated in every relationship I’ve ever been in and finally fell in love enough to actually chance for someone and for the betterment of myself as well. I stopped smoking, vaping, drinking and have decided to not get anymore face tattoos and took out a few piercings. Not all these things were at his request though. He’s accepted me, he buys me food everyday if we/ I want it, I lost my job and he broke his foot but after a while ( 2 weeks) he started going to work on his broken foot in a boot to provide for us, my family love him and he loves them ( my nephew is downstairs right now spending the weekend), he’s encouraging me to get my high school diploma to better my/our future, and most of all he said yes them I proposed. I guess since I’ve hurt so many people and have been hurt by so many as well and made him cry twice. I just feel so bad and because of that guilt I feel like maybe he secretly hates me or something, wants revenge. He told me he doesn’t and doesn’t but I can’t shake it. I thought I was incapable of deep real love at some point. Now I know that’s not the case but I’m suffering because of my decisions. I just wanna get out of this loop of fearing he’ll do something to hurt me back. I just wanna love my husband fearlessly, but I’m so afraid I’ll get hurt. I feel dumb, lost, helpless, hopeless and just an all around mess. I don’t know what to do. I can tell he gets frustrated with me but I ca. also tell he loves me. I just do t wanna lose him. He’s the best gift I’ve ever received. I just think back to those times before I start feeling g so lost and insecure. Always wondering if he’s flirting at work, gonna sneak off when I sleep, gonna text someone he shouldn’t . I feel like it’s all karma. He hasn’t even done any of this but I’m just so afraid I’ll find out he’s actually a horrible person, like me. 

So, how can I stop feeling the need to question his intentions, put my mind to rest and at ease and just enjoy the amazing man I actually have? I don’t wanna feel crazy anymore. I’ve literally thought about going impatient at points because he just gets so bad in my head.

I have a hard time making friends, or mostly just connecting with people right off the bat 

These people have been people I’ve been connecting w/ for a while now, maybe 2-3 ish years? I don’t really remember. Anyway idk how to just word this but recently it’s felt like they’ve stopped caring about me, stopped considering me a friend- sometimes even stopped considering me a person.

It started when I got sensitive over some words in early June. I made a bit of a big deal about it, and was having a really hard time coping that month as it’s the month of my dad’s birthday who passed not too long ago. I tend to get pretty emotional during the summer anyway, but everything ontop of eachother seemed to make it worse

Anyway I really upset my friend because I was upset at something they said and it was a whole stupid thing. I apologized and it seemed okay

But 

I’m sorry I’m just so exhausted from everything and feeling all of these emotions I’m sure none of this is coherent or matters or idk

They just don’t care anymore

Nobody tries to involve me in anything, they keep getting mad at me for being a bit naive, they blame me for a lot of things, and make fun of me. and I know I’m not perfect- sometimes I deserve this stuff. I struggle with discouraged bpd, so anyone who has the same kind could maybe understand what I mean

I tried expressing how I want to be better and not screw up, and also asked them to stop making fun of me. But they didn’t care, just brushed it off- actually one of the mutual friends sent a stupid sims sex mod video or something in response to me talking about it so that was fun

Idk. I’ve tried everything I can to better myself and be a good person but I don’t think they like me anymore. Which sucks because I was the person who introduced them to eachother, 

Idk. They just always constantly make me feel like some sort of Hitler incarnate with how often and aggressively they get upset with me. 

It’s been so exhausting, I’ve been really struggling with suicidal thoughts lately as I know losing them means I loose the only friends I felt truly connected with.

But I’m angry, I feel betrayed, like they don’t care, like they don’t want me around anymore, like I’m a burden. I don’t like feeling like this. It’s already hard to deal with ontop of all the stresses of college and independence which is new to me.

Sometimes I just want to curse out at them, but then I think I probably deserve it. I know I’m naive, I know I’m sometimes accidentally insensitive, so maybe I deserve it

It’s just so exhausting feeling like a punching bag

1ml63we,My ER Experience (TW),"I had a very bad episode yesterday that lasted all day. Usually, my episodes hit at night and I can just sleep them off, but I experienced a big trigger early last morning that set me off for the rest of the day. 

In that state, I didn't know what to do. I was a severe risk to myself (when my baseline is usually maybe moderate.) I walked myself to a nearby ISK (my local mental health services organization) building in search of help. I didn't feel helped by them, so I took their recommendation to go to the ER next door. 

That's where my nightmare began. I took that walk and entered that building knowing they couldn't provide for me the care that I needed. I just thought, ""maybe they can keep me safe."" 

But as a single small person alone having a mental health crisis, I was not safe with them either. 

They confined me alone in a small room for hours. Me, who felt like the pain was so bad in my head that I was compulsed to hurt myself, alone with nobody to talk to or help guide me through my episode.

I confess to hitting my head. It's how I regulate when I have nothing and nobody to help me. I can always control it so that it doesn't do any damage though. Unless I'm really triggered over the edge. 

Like when you tell them you're an adult refusing medication and you just want to call your mom to speak to her or the social workers to get you out of there but they won't let you. Instead, they just bring in those big security guards again like the ones from the first time this happened to you because you stood at your door ""looking threatening."" 

You beg and scream as your PTSD kicks in when they start closing in on you alone in that tiny room. Then they use their giant hands to grab you around your wrists and your legs, hoisting you up and pinning you down on the gurney until you can't move and they inject you with something you dont know the name of. 

I begged. I pleaded. I tried to reason. I told them, ASKED them, ""HOW IS THIS GOING TO HELP ME?""
I was left alone again with security waiting outside my door. Can you guess what happened next? 

The medication they forcefully gave me, justifying its injection into me by saying ""it will calm you down,"" DID NOT CALM ME DOWN. 

My anxiety skyrocketed after that. I tried to hide, but found nowhere to go but under a counter, where I impulsively hit my head even harder. 

Then the security guards came in. The nurse came in and grabbed me by the wrist again and everyone's hands were on me again and they lifted me up off the floor and the nurse laid on my lower half as they injected me again.
 
And then they left me alone again, screaming in ways I didnt think was possible from me. They did not calm me down. They drugged me so harshly that by the time the social worker came to speak to me, I could not speak coherently and had to beg her to stay and force myself as hard as I could to say coherent words. 

General hospitals/ERs are not equipped to treat mental patients, but that's the only option we're given if we're in immediate crisis and seeking help. That is one of the HUGE problems with the mental health crisis we're experiencing as a society.

 We don't give people in crisis an easy way to get help. A person experiencing a mental health crisis should not be going to the same place where people in physical crisis are being treated.

 Hospitals do not have the proper staff to treat mental health patients. We need centers like ERs, but for mental health emergencies. 

What happened to me at Bronson Methodist Hospital yesterday has me physically shaken today and feeling violated and VERY mistreated. People in mental health crises should NOT be left alone without a MENTAL HEALTH professional to speak to. We shouldn't be drugged against our wills and manhandled when all we want is to speak to our mothers. 

I was not helped yesterday, instead I was further traumatized by people who insisted they were helping me. They did nothing but drug me against my will. They did not treat me. ",1754684847.0,4,3,BPD,bpd

1ml6ncv,My GFs ex friend made me drop out of my nursing course,"Gossip at nursing school has made things unbearable

I’m in nursing school, and lately I feel like everything has fallen apart because of gossip.

I’m in class with someone who used to be friends with my girlfriend. This person treated me horribly and told my girlfriend she shouldn't be with me because I have BPD.  My girlfriend finally called them out (I had asked her to defend me before). They didn’t take it well and ended up messaging their ex about it.

She called me slurs and told my girlfriend ""I needed more pills for my bpd""

Now the problem is, they're still in my class and spread gossip about us to everyone. The entire class has turned their back on us. We’re about to start our final group paper, and we have no one to work with.

Yesterday was the breaking point: I said on the groupchat shouldn’t skip class because it was a new teacher and subject, and the class called me out. I broke down crying. I can’t stand the constant staring and the feeling that everyone hates me without even knowing me.

I used to love this course, but now I’m thinking of quitting. On top of this, I’m moving out of town soon, I feel really lonely and my mental health is really bad right now. I feel both numb and overwhelmed, and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

1mlcmx5,I have commitment issues & now I’m accidentally someone’s girlfriend.. yikes,"***Please, don’t scroll. I need help and want to know I hope I’m not alone. I’m not justifying wrong behaviour***

I (F) accidentally became someone’s girlfriend, realized I’m not into her (F), and I still have interest in other people… all while I came to a revelation that I have commitment issues when I never used to. 

(Context: my last relationship was 4 months—emotionally and mentally abusive—and it really took a toll. All my failed relationships piled up, and now I don’t want to commit to anyone… maybe I’m non-monogamous?)

I like chaos & “fun”, but the uncomfortableness of leading people on is getting to me. I hate putting myself in situations where I let people down because I had situations where I was constantly let down.. now I’m the one doing it.

This realization about my commitment issues hit me after this: I met a girl at work in May, and by now, we had been talking for hours, hanging out, having sex, meeting each other’s families (not for romantic reasons, just to all hang out and get to know each other), etc. (BAD IDEA BECAUSE SHE ALSO HAS BPD AND I NOTICE WE MIRROR EACH OTHER!) smh.. and I’ve always liked men more, but thought I’d try dating a woman again. 

A week and a half ago, I jokingly said, “We’re basically girlfriends haha,” and she asked me out on the spot. I rashly said yes—bad idea. Now I want to slow things down, but we’re already deep in it, and honestly, I feel repulsed realizing I’m not into women like I thought. The sex, the romance has totally repulsed me. I’m also talking to someone else I’m “dating” at the same time. I plan to end this with her soon.
I already told her that when she comes back from her trip, I need to talk to her and she’s super nervous now and told me to not leave her… 🙁

My questions:

	•	Can anyone relate to these situations?

	•	Why is it common for people with BPD to “cheat,” yet we’re some of the most loyal and compassionate people?

	•	What has been your experience with stopping this behavior?

I didn’t blow up, like I have in the past. I’ve been emotionally regulating really well for 6 months. No emotional blow outs at all. 

But I was recently triggered by something and didn’t catch it early enough. I could feel my distrust and feeling of abandonment building inside for a week. I tried to talk myself out of it. I tried (weakly) to share what I was feeling with my partner. But it built and built. 

Until I could feel a breaking point. So I told them how I was feeling. Suspicious. Distrusting. Not able to tell what’s real and what’s symptom or reaction to feeling abandoned. 

But it’s been over a week of this. And this pattern (historically a lot more frequent & intense with huge screaming/sobbing blow outs) is one I’ve exhibited for the last 15 years of our relationship.  So they’re tired. And feel like they are walking on eggshells around me.

I said I needed their support to help me get through this one. They said that every time this happens, it’s bruising. It’s not a clean slate. It leaves a mark that takes time to heal.

I met a wonderful neighbour who has BPD, and our kiddos are becoming friends. She's absolutely awesome - and I've been friends with some folks with BPD in the past and so have a bit of an idea - I did have someone split on me before and it's something that I can't handle have happen again as I've got my own mental chaos going on. I really appreciate and like this neighbour, and we're becoming friends. I do worry that she's idolizing me, and I'm really a flawed, overwhelmed human. She does want to hang out a lot more than I have time for - and because of the extra commitments I have going on, my social battery is just constantly depleted. She doesn't work and struggles with friendships, and I can't keep up with how much she wants to hang out or text. I've tried explaining that I am not a texter (I don't even bring my cell with me to work as I like being unreachable while I'm working) and am just ridiculously busy and stretched thin. I know she's put in a lot of work with DBT and I can tell. I also know she's had a lot of childhood trauma and that complicates what she's navigating for sure, and I think plays into the attachment need I'm seeing. 

I want to be a good friend to her, but I also need to manage expectations and I don't have the ability to be consistently present, especially in this period of time with all that I have going on. I don't want to assume that she'll split on me, but I did notice the idolizing, and I worry a bit.

And while I totally have mood swings from happy to sad to anxious (I also have GAD), I’m never angry. I guess everything I feel is just internal. I pull away from people out of fear of rejection instead of forced clinginess in friendships. I have a long term relationship that has always been healthy. I feel emotions so strongly, and I tend to overreact, but I always put negative emotions on myself instead of others because I don’t want anyone to feel mad at me. It’s the worst feeling in the world. And I have intrusive thoughts and sometimes compulsions.

(18f) i have diagnosed bpd and like i think now its severe (im sorry this text is going to be a whole lotta mess because i am too exhausted and depressed and everything to be using proper grammar and language). I was in a 3 year old relationship with this one person who is also most likely mentally ill, he has damaged me in all cases and he has avoidant attachment style and it is also very severe. He was my favorite person, constant breakups constant violence, in past he used to manipulate me into having sex with him, he cheated on me 10 times and i always stayed because of my unconditional forever love; constant feelings, constant crashouts from me, two suicide attempts from me: never have i ever felt secure in this relationship. We have broken up many times, for month, two, have gotten back together a lot too. Two days ago i fell asleep and woke up to find out that he is gone and he flew away to another state, i tried texting him when i realized i was blocked everywhere. I started trying to kill myself. It is day 2 of this mental state of me just being in apathy i feel nothing but hurt, we have broken up almost exactly like this before but i am so obsessive over him i feel so much love so much unconditional love towards him and i always have. Last time we got back together he promised to me on everything he would never leave me ever again.  Its not like i trusted or believed his words because he has hurt me the exact same before but i still feel shitty as fuck knowing this coudlve happened but my feelings just blocked out my brain and i believed he wouldnt do that to me. I have not eaten a single thing this whole entire time, my heart is racing 24/7 i can literally feel it beat fast, my stomach hurts from anxiety, i have full on anxiety together with psychosis (i start to imagine things about him and why he left me and i start being delusional thinking he has been propped to harm me ever since we met, planned out getting back together just to see me suffer) i dissociate so much. My heart and head also hurt, i cant stop thinking about him at all. After finding out that he left i packed my stuff and asked my friend (who i didn't talk to for 3 months because i am so obsessive over him i feel like i dont need any other person in my life whatsoever, plus i was way too exhausted and depressed to have powers for other people in my life) to stay over.

My friend broke up with her gf and her words were ‘even my friend with BPD talks to me almost everyday’.
Am I not supposed to? It felt really weird and out of context and again, hurtful.

I’m also never allowed to just be upset about anything. It’s always ‘oh no, he’s splitting again’ when I was just said ‘fvck’ after I had stubbed my toe on a walk while I was on call with my BF.

Is there a way I can stop splitting? Or getting upset? Or seeming like an abuser ig? Was the comment about me talking with my friend every day fair or was it weird?",1754662767.0,5,3,BPD,bpd
1ml7o3k,My new health care providers don't believe i have BPD even though I'm diagnosed,"I recently had to part ways with my old therapist because she moved offices and could no longer take my insurance and i can't afford to pay out of pocket. I've also been looking to switch to a new psychiatrist because she's made some inappropriate comments in the past. My former therapist recommended a program with our county, so i called them and we got an intake appointment set up. 
During the 2 hour intake session I had talked about everything I was diagnosed with and my symptoms and at the end, the lady doing the interview said she didn't want to put BPD on my chart because 'its a very serious diagnosis and your symptoms will likely be relieved by medicating your ADHD and trauma therapy. I thought it was weird but she kept explaining it away and i just thought it probably wouldn't affect too much. 
About a week later I got a notice in the mail saying my ""Specialty mental health service request was denied"". I was very confused because all the intake lady and i discussed setting me up with was weekly therapy and a psychiatrist. That same day I had an appointment with the new psychiatrist. Im that appointment he said ""so it looks like you're in for ADHD some PTSD symptoms and some anxiety right?"" So i said, ""Is that all thats in there?"" and he said, ""Is there more?""  So come to find out not only did the intake lady not put in BPD she also left out MDD and OCD so no wonder my stuff got denied. I filed an appeal and added that I am suicidal so hopefully they take that seriously.
I talked to the new therapist for the second time today and after mentioning all this she was emphasizing that its a very serious diagnosis and not common to get. But again, I've LITERALLY BEEN DIAGNOSED. She did agree to get me a proper pysch evaluation and try to get me an actual psychiatrist (i found out from her the ""psychiatrist"" i saw is just a nurse, so i dont know if i even wanna try the mood stabilizers he put me on).

So my question is how do I get them to take me and my diagnosis seriously? I plan on taking notes of all my symptoms that match DSM-5 criteria for my diagnoses. But if anyone else has struggled with this sort of thing I'd really appreciate some advice. I'm just trying to get the proper level of care I need.",1754688600.0,1,3,BPD,bpd

1ml7iri,DAE with EUPD also have relatives with EUPD? How is/was life together?,"I (24M) found out today via a PALS (the NHS' complaints organisation) investigation that I was diagnosed in 2021 with EUPD impulsive type when I was 20; this also included a diagnosis of Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder (MADD) after previously being diagnosed with panic disorder in 2018. I only found out anything to do with this diagnosis because on a letter from the crisis team to my GP they included it in there and found I was actually assessed for a mental disorder in the adult mental health services near when I first started seeing them. 

My older sister (28) also has EUPD and they knew she had it before she was 18,  diagnosed with BPD when she was 18. She told me about it when I was around 14/15. From what I understand I believe she'd likely have borderline type EUPD. She really doesn't like the idea of being abandoned. She attempted suicide many times, self harmed, did substance abuse, had the worst of bulimia and she had to go into a psych ward when I was 13. We are currently no contact after I blocked her number the end of last year due to her very toxic behaviour towards me, which I don't think is solely the EUPD. She has emotionally abused me in the past and whenever she misunderstands something or doesn't agree with something she insults me related to me having autism and she even brought up our dead mother (3 years ago from cancer) and likened me to our abusive father (who I have an ok relationship with) into our last conversation. We fought so many times growing up but it's not just me she doesn't get on with, it's my younger siblings and dad as well. On our last big fight she called the police on me to get me arrested for assault and said I pinned her to the floor only for her to drop all of that later that night.

I also struggle with keeping in contact with family and don't really have friends despite not fighting with them due to paranoia and thinking people are not really caring about me let alone with her. She has a daughter who is a year old with her fiancé who is like a wet blanket. We don't live near each other as she never moved up the country with my parents and younger siblings as she left home (well, mum put her in care when I was 13 or 14 then stayed in my hometown after that until recently according to my younger sister) by the time I moved up north and I haven't moved down. 

We both were brought up with abusive parents and they abused each other, they broke up many times and mum would take us and our younger siblings (21F, 18M) to women's refuges or bed and breakfasts (they're like hostels). Both of the mental difficulties in us seem to be triggered by one of these places. I was in a b&b at age 12 that triggered panic attacks, anxiety, depression, disordered eating, increased self harm, etc. My sister said she got triggered by a near death experience in a refuge when she was 9/10 and I was 6 which I remember being at but not as well. There are some different experiences that also happened before and after that, especially as I am autistic.",1754688239.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mkp4p4,"My girlfriend loves me deeply, but her BPD mood swings and lashing out are starting to wear me down. I need advice.","I’m 17 and in my first real relationship. At the start, everything felt peaceful — she was sweet, kind, and we clicked so easily. But a few weeks in, things shifted. She told me she has BPD, and after losing close friends recently, she’s been overwhelmed by fear that I’ll leave her too.

She sometimes lashes out at me during her mood swings. It hurts because I know it’s not really about me — it’s her trying to protect herself from future pain. She even admitted that deep down, she wants to push me away now before I can hurt her later. It breaks my heart.

I told her how much the lashing out affects me. She listened, but it hit her hard. She said she thought I could handle her, and now she feels like she’s failing me. I don’t want her to feel that way. I love her. I want to be with her. I don’t think about leaving unless she spirals — and even then, it’s just fear talking, not something I want to act on.

I stay because I care, not out of pity or obligation. But it's been draining. I don’t know how to comfort her in those moments without losing parts of myself. I also don’t know how to convince her I’m not going anywhere — not just with words, but in a way she can feel and believe.

I need advice from people who’ve either been through this or live with BPD themselves. How do I support her without burning out? How do I show her I’m staying without making her feel pressured?
I love her. I just want to do this right.

Me my roommates and my fiancé are all being vilified by people who were supposed to be our friends but dropped us the second they had a chance to.

I feel like I’m gonna puke I can’t keep doing this. Every time I try to breathe and calm down I get so angry again and fly off the handle. How do you deal with this rage because I’m at my wits end with people betraying and triggering me thinking it’s a fun game. No one takes me seriously because of my diagnosis’s and it’s so frustrating.

1ml6z3x,I just wanted to describe my bpd and have everyone's thoughts on it.,"Every single day feels like a quiet funeral.
For who I was.
For who I’ll never be.
For all the versions of me that tried so fucking hard just to be loved and still got left behind.

It’s like there’s a noose wrapped around my soul...not tight enough to kill me, just enough to choke every breath, every word, every hope I try to speak. And I walk through life like that. Smiling. Laughing. Helping others.
But inside, I am already long gone.

I don’t throw tantrums. I don’t scream for attention.
I collapse inward.
And no one notices.
Not because they don’t care...but because I’ve trained myself to be invisible when I’m in pain. That’s what being “too much” gets you....rejection. Silence. Abandonment. So now I fold up my suffering like laundry and hide it behind polite texts and fake smiles.
I grieve myself in secret.

Some nights I lie in bed, completely still, and think:
“If I just stopped existing, would anyone even feel it?”
Not the mask I wear. Not the version of me people get.
Me. The raw, aching, desperate me.
The one too afraid to ask for help.
The one who wants to scream please love me, but is too ashamed of needing it.

Most people  don’t know what it’s like to be alive and already feel like a ghost.
To wake up and resent that your heart is still beating.
To cry so hard in the shower your ribs hurt, and then walk out of the bathroom like nothing happened.

There’s just this shell left. Polite. Quiet. Distant.
Smiling just enough not to worry anyone.
But completely hollow inside.

I fantasize about death not because I want to be gone,
Because I’m exhausted. I am bone-deep tired of carrying wounds no one sees.
Tired of feeling like I’m never enough.
Tired of hurting people just by existing.
Tired of always being too much or not enough, and never something safe to love.
I'm tired of these emotional third degree burns ...
They say it gets better.
But when?
When you’ve been in survival mode for so long, you start to wonder if “better” was a lie.
Or maybe it’s just something meant for other people
the ones who weren’t born broken.

I am not looking for attention.
I am looking for a endless silence.
Not the silence that echoes in my chest at 3AM when I’m begging the ceiling to make it stop...
but real silence.
The kind that means peace.
The kind that means finally, there’s no more screaming inside.

I know this sounds selfish. I know people love me.
But love doesn’t reach where I’m bleeding.
Love doesn’t fix the feeling that I am unfixable.

Everytime I have a episode 
It was because I cared so much, that it was killing me.

1ml6oc9,Urgent help needed,"I'm urgently looking for advice. I've been with my bpd boyfriend a little over 2 years, and his splits have become less and less and almost every time he splits, he says that we need to break up or we can't hang out anymore. And almost every single time, it's because of finances and he also splits after almost every trip. But the past few months or so have been great minus like a couple mini splits, but then he went camping with his cousin last week and barely texted, which is normal when he camps. Once he got back, he was just kind of distant and I just felt like weird vibes. And we were sort of texting later that night, and yeah, it was about finances about a trip we took like a month ago. And he just split out of nowhere a minute after a totally normal text he sent, and said that he's selling everything because he needs to buy an apartment building by next year. And he's so far behind on everything. And he's so pissed off because of it, and that we can't hang out anymore. Not even talk and that he's going to help out around the yard and stuff, but that he won't be around much. He's living with his parents next door while his dad has been sick for the past like year or so. That's actually how I met him was through his parents. He had made me promise to him about a year or so ago to never let him break up with me. And that he would never break up with me a text. He also has a bunch of stuff here that he hasnt come to take so idk if that's a good sign. But I don't know why this time just feels different and feels kind of real and I've been it's spiraling out of control. I'm also leaving for Greece for 2 and a 1/2 weeks next week. I could tell that he was a little bit nervous about that. Because he has insecurity issues and Thinks that I'm going to meet somebody better. He will sometimes make comments about that. He split on me last year too right before leaving for Greece. And he's always nervous that I'm going to cheat, even though he said that he knows that I would never would. He said he had bad jealousy/controlling issues in past relationships. Do you guys think that he's just splitting, and he's gonna go back to normal or that he's like actually done? because I'm panicking. And I don't want to go to Greece not knowing if we're together and having all my family asking about him and having to fake it to them. Him and I have talked marriage many times and are great together 99% of the time. I don't really know how to navigate this. He hasnt really texted at all besides about his dog that I'm watching til tomorrow. I texted him today about the dog and he gave dry responses.

1ml6b1n,Back and forth between low/too much empathy,"I think I'm finally admitting to myself that I have issues with empathy. I didn't want to. But I've been reflecting lately and realizing that I don't think I'm particularly pleasant to be around, especially at work. I'm often in a bad mood, annoyed by others. I've never truly lashed out at someone other than being a little snappy once or twice but I know it sometimes bleeds through in my tone and body language. I don't know how *much* but I know it does. The worst part is that I work in a mix of a customer service/medical environment. And I've been thinking today that, knowing this, I think I need to make a goal of getting a job that keeps me separated from people. I am not fit for this. In the moment I'm callous and careless and self centered, but then like right now I feel like I'm going to cry at the idea that a patient could have picked up on my tone and felt like a burden because of me. 

I notice that when other people are telling me about their problems I feel nothing (unless it's my partner.) When I hear about tragedies I have to really work to get myself to emotionally feel something. The upset of others often (to my dismay) feels like an inconvenience. 

I just don't get it because I *want to change it.* I don't want to be like this!! But in the moment, I feel nothing. I lose urgency to alter my habits. I care, but I don't *feel* the emotional motivation behind it. So I keep repeating the same shit. Some days it's so severe that I wonder if something more serious is going on. I feel broken, permanently immature. And yet at the same time, I know from experience that there's another person buried inside of me that cares so much about everything that it hurts. I *can* feel empathy for other people. I *do* when I'm....I don't know, when I'm able to stop and really become mindful of another person's suffering. I catch fleeting glimpses of that person, I can remember days and times where I have been them, but most of the time I'm just...not. 

And I don't know how to be that person every day. I don't know if I can. It's either too much or too little and I sometimes wonder if 'that person' is even real, or just a prettier, yet ultimately still self-seeking illusion. My baseline seems to be carelessness. It makes doing the work to be a better person like sisyphus pushing his rock, because I can't *feel* the motive/urgency 90% of the time. I've talked to my therapist about it, and she suggested it might have something to do with IFS? I don't know. I hate it. I feel like even if I 'put in the work' I'm just a naturally bad person.

1mk611y,Things that have helped in my BPD journey,"Things that have helped me since my BPD diagnosis last September.

If you're serious about healing, be honest with yourself, be honest with the things you do that you know are wrong.    
1) If you're struggling with depression, anxiety, or anything else, talk to your provider about seeking the right medication to manage that or if medication is even the right path for you.  (it helped me immensely, even a very small dosage)    
2) Journal, every day, go within, look outside of yourself.  
3) When you experience that mind numbing emptiness and unyielding boredom.  Sit in it, don't do anything with it, don't try to do something to escape it, just LET IT hit you fully, let it consume you, sit in it as long as you can possibly tolerate.  This is your nervous system restoring itself, after enough rest, and it may take a long fucking time, you'll find yourself a lot calmer on the other side.  (again, medication helps with this)  
4) They say BPD is developed from inconsistent parental attention, maybe even trauma.  Think of a boat at sea in stormy waters.  That's your nervous system.  So now as an adult, your job is to reach the Caribbean, those smooth waters, no massive ups and downs, just level.  Don't worry about losing your spark, when you have bpd you'll never lose your spark, your struggle will be to keep that amazing spark from burning you and those you love.  (this will be a lifelong goal)  
5)  BPD is a superpower if you learn how to use it.  You are likely naturally more creative, more action oriented, and more passionate than your peers.  Learn to channel that energy positively.  I love journaling, drawing, writing music, just anything to get out the endless flow of thoughts within my head.  
6)  Fall in love with your life, learn to appreciate all the small things, the tiny blessings, a cats meow, the silence of the people walking outside your window, the small magic of living.  (soon the leaves will change color, learn to fall in love with that change)  
7)  Learn as much as you can, read books, watch you tube videos, learn learn learn!  Don't think of this as a burden, this is an exciting journey of self discovery that you're starting on.  If you take it serious, your BPD will be the catalyst that changes the lives of many individuals in a positive way.  
8) learn to pause, learn to journal, learn that your feelings are valid and if you need to experience them.  Don't ever let anyone tell you that your feelings aren't valid, don't ever feel shame for crying.  If you're in public  and you need to get some privacy, do that, but don't let anyone invalidate how you feel, that is YOUR experience, NOT theirs.  
9)  Write down objective truths, you can explore the what ifs how's, who whys, but ground yourself in reality and make decisions based on what you can objectively quantify and observe.  
10) This one I struggle with still but try your best to cut out alcohol.  I still drink often but it's still a limiter and can lower impulse control in an already dysregulated brain.  Do your best to cut out alcohol, if you need to cut it out completely, then take that seriously and do that.

You are amazing, you are valid, you deserve to love and be loved, and you can DO this!  Some of the coolest badasses in history had BPD.  (Marilyn Monroe, Virginia Woolfe, Earnest Hemmingway).  All very creative individuals.  Be patient with yourself, surround yourself with people who support you, and be the best person you can be.",1754586998.0,155,31,BPD,bpd
1ml67b3,Navigating polyamory with BPD,"Just wanted to start off with, please be nice and don't judge. This is my very real life that I chose for myself and at the core of it, I am happy with my lifestyle and do not want to change it. I'm committed to this relationship and I'm striving for a healthy relationship that lasts. 

Me and my partner dated for 2 years and then broke up for 1 year. We recently reconciled and have decided to work things out. We are polyamorous and have a ""kitchen table"" relationship, where we all know everything going on. We live together and his other partner also lives with us. He also has a couple of FWBs. I personally prefer to keep one partner and have FWBs, though I do not have any at the moment. 

We struggle with our communication sometimes. Recently he got upset with me because he feels like I have a problem every day and its mentally exhausting. I understand his side, but at the same time it feels like he wants me to bottle up my feelings. He thinks that because I'm bringing something up, I am bothered and upset by it, which causes him distress. While I do bring up things that are bothering me, I'm not always upset about it, I mainly try to bring things up before they become a bigger problem and cause me to spiral and have an episode. When we have a conflict, it tends to stay in my mind for awhile until I bring it up in an effort to communicate with him and solve the issue. I do admit that I overthink a lot and worry a lot. But I thought by getting it out in the open, I was doing good. 

We also have issues with time. We decided that each partner gets one dedicated day per week, and the rest of the week gets split between us and his other friends. But when it came to my day, we barely talked or hung out the entire day because he had an appointment and then he was too tired. We only got an hour of actual quality time before it was late and time for bed. It made me feel like I'm not worth the effort. I'm afraid of bringing this up with him because I don't want to cause another conflict. 

I'm not without issues here either. I'm very quick to assume the worst, I'm sometimes irritable, sometimes angry. I'm very impulsive, and my BPD triggers will send me off the deep end and I struggle to control my thoughts and emotions. I can be a jealous person, and seeing other people get the attention I want really hurts sometimes, especially when I feel our time has been lacking that week. He's said some of my issues are too much to handle, especially when he has multiple partners whose feelings he has to consider. I'm currently medicated and do DBT at home, and I'm seeking therapy services. 

I'm just looking for any advice on navigating this relationship. I feel like I'm too much to handle. I feel like he doesn't fully understand my mental state. He is also very stubborn in his ways and opinions so it's been hard talking about our issues and resolving in a way that makes us both happy. Despite these issues, we do love each other and we go together well. We have the same interests and goals in life. We have a lot of fun when we have good times. But the bad times can get very bad, especially when I have an episode. Sorry for the long post, and TIA for any advice and support.",1754685069.0,0,9,BPD,bpd

Context, I was diagnosed in May by my psychiatrist when attempting to get a PTSD diagnosis// in january, I had the worstttt break up ever trusttt. 

Earlier this year, I met this guy on a dating app and started things off by initiating a platonic relationship. We had a lot of similar interests and were studying the same major at the same university. obviously we did not stay platonic. He understood me, and so I revealed my diagnosis to him, and he assured me that he didn’t think any differently of me and started researching BPD. I told him that I adore him and I have feelings for him last month, but I still can not be in a relationship because I need to keep working in DBT therapy and be better for myself and the people I’m closest to. 

He spent the night a few days ago and was upset about something, which really stressed me out because he wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. he kept saying he’d rather not tell me, but continued to act so depressed. So I used a DBT skill, DEARMAN, to navigate the conversation. He finally told me, “I love you.” 

WHAAAAAT? HELLO? That was not what I was expecting. Suddenly, I pulled my hand away from his and just started sobbing for about 10 minutes. Then I tried to explain myself. He seemed like he expected that exact reaction from me. He just kind of sat there, and it was really admirable, and I really do adore him. I am just so scared of love. I’m worried I will hurt him.

I feel like at first I give trust to a therapist quickly because I want to heal and get started, but when something happens (like they invalidate me in what I consider a harsh way), I immediately get cold and I start to build resentment very quickly. I have layers and layers of resentment and rage towards others to the point that I worry it will be necessary for me to isolate for the rest of my life just because it's not good for others to be around me. I never do anything about the resentment...I just silently get angry because I worry my reaction will be too 'big' if I choose to react.  

Lately I've been very reflective and I think wow, am I so ill that I am beyond help? Does anyone have any like non-DBT therapies that work? I'm really ashamed to write all this, but I'm getting tired of needing to isolate.",1754664446.0,2,1,BPD,bpd

But the strange part is that she also sends stuff similar to this pretty often, in a fun way of course. Not to forget we had so many conversations about it too (conversations about moving into one place in the future, possibly to a new common city to avoid our long distance)

she said that because im 19 (young in her eyes) and am diagnosed with autism, adhd, and anxiety, that she cannot diagnose me with bpd as having all of these can look really similar to having bpd. and idk what to do. i feel excluded from all of these communities as my symptoms are so severe and ""crazy"" (at least in my eyes) and i heavily relate to this community. i don't comment a lot on posts here as im not diagnosed and dont want to seem insensitive, but i genuinely relate to so many of you and idk what to do.

the reason why i've been inclined to seek a bpd diagnosis is because i've been tested for bipolar before and got told i do have a lot of mood instability and a lot of symptoms of bipolar, but that i don't meet the criteria for bipolar due to the manner and longevity of my mood shifts and ""delusional"" thoughts (quotations as i'm not sure if it delusion or not), and i've been repeatedly told to try CBT again despite it not working previously (i have tried many times with different therapists). i meet pretty much all the criteria of bpd, unless it all has to be actively happening, then i would say i only meet about 4-6 of the criteria

idk. could i please get some advice? she told me to get my adhd treated again and has increased my antidepressant dosage but i do not feel supported or included anywhere. idk. i know that a lot of the bpd treatment is similar to anxiety treatment, but i just feel so crazy and excluded in the symptoms i experience. has anyone experienced something similar to this? also idk if it's right to post this here since im not diagnosed with bpd. let me know if i should post this in neurodiversity instead lol

Over the first couple of weeks, we were hanging out after work nearly every day and spending most of the weekends together too. Then they went about 5 days without seeing me and it honestly triggered me quite a bit. It’s not that I can’t go a few days without seeing them. (They also had to go out of town for work for a full week and that didn’t bother me.) It’s that they COULD have seen me but they chose not to. They chose to not make me a priority. Now from a past experience dating someone who didn’t prioritize me and, looking back, just straight up did not place much value on me, I’m just extremely hyper vigilant. I don’t want to waste my time on someone who is just using me as dopamine supply when it’s convenient for them. It’s sending my brain into fight or flight. I’m having thoughts that I should just end it because they clearly don’t value me. But I also know I’m being too extreme with that thinking. And that’s the thing about my brain, I have NO IDEA how much of my thoughts are rational. I cannot tell the difference between when I’m being perfectly reasonable or asking for way too much. I know I can’t expect the person I’m dating’s life to completely revolve around me. But I crave intimacy. I don’t understand how it’s normal to go days without seeing your person. Every day they’re not around I feel empty, I feel like I’m just waiting for them to come back so I can feel like a person again. I know it sounds way too co dependent. But is it really so crazy to need someone else? To crave intimate human connection? Isn’t that what life is all about? I know some people’s responses will probably be something along the lines of “you need to find value and meaning in your life outside of the person you’re dating.” For the record, I do have a full time job, am in school, have hobbies etc. You could say I am lacking in the friend department for sure. But I do have a few friendships that just are not nearly fulfilling and intimate enough to give me the connection I crave from a partner.

Relationships of any kind whether that be romantic, platonic, or familial bring me so much anxiety that I don’t even think it’s worth it anymore. 

Everyone I’ve ever known ends up disappointing/betraying/hurting/leaving me at some point, and I just can’t take it anymore. I can’t take anymore hurt. I’ve experienced so much of it in the short time I’ve been on this earth. 

I don’t know how everyone else around me seems to be so fine all the time. They all seem like they’ve found their people, whether that be a romantic partner or a group of friends or even just a really great family. 

Trying to form/maintain relationships with people just leaves me feeling insecure, anxious, and hurt anyways, so I might as well just be alone for the rest of my life, right? 

I want everyone to leave me alone. Even though it might get lonely at times, at least it’s peaceful, and I’m not constantly in a heightened emotional state.

We had a lot of similar interests and were studying the same major at the same university. obviously we did not stay platonic. He understood me, and so I revealed my diagnosis to him, and he assured me that he didn’t think any differently of me and started researching BPD. I told him that I adore him and I have feelings for him last month, but I still can not be in a relationship because I need to keep working in DBT therapy and be better for myself and the people I’m closest to. 

He spent the night a few days ago and was upset about something, which really stressed me out because he wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. he kept saying he’d rather not tell me, but continued to act so depressed. So I used a DBT skill, DEARMAN, to navigate the conversation. He finally told me, “I love you.” 

WHAAAAAT? HELLO? That was not what I was expecting. Suddenly, I pulled my hand away from his and just started sobbing for about 10 minutes. Then I tried to explain myself. He seemed like he expected that exact reaction from me. He just kind of sat there, and it was really admirable, and I really do adore him. I am just so scared of love. I’m worried I will hurt him.

When I say shallow, I mean a guy just has to be mildly nice to me for me to fall really hard. Most of the time, I don't talk to these guys outside of school (I'm currently in my 4th year of uni at the moment). At the same time though, I get irrationally angry that my nonsense expectations fall through because...why would a guy who barely talked to me be interested in my weird scenario that I invented in my head, especially since I'm already deathly afraid of confession so I just never say anything until I make a fool of myself and it just becomes extremely obvious. Because of this, I've been avoiding romantic relationships for the past 6 years.

However, I met a guy two years ago and we became super good friends. We talk every day, we share a lot together, he's super sympathetic about me and my worries, and it's fun to be around him. He treats me really well. I feel like an actual person. He's like my universe. I adore him a lot. I wasn't going into this friendship for anything romantic at all. I really like being friends, but it's hard with this annoying feeling in my chest. I wanna do fun things with him and experience so much. It almost felt like I could do the impossible and just say how I feel and not worry about anything. But then found someone a year ago.

I'm happy for him, of course. Elated, even. He's really happy. But it's really hard not to get angry or super upset about it. I catch myself feeling sick to my stomach whenever he mentions his girlfriend. The girl is really nice too. We've talked and I genuinely like her a lot. She's really good for him, I hate it so much. My friend is just as nice to me as ever. Nothing changed between us, which makes me even more upset. I've cried about this a lot, and I feel disgusting for being this upset about my friend's happiness. It's irrational and awful for me to be this upset. God forbid, if I mention this to people, they tell me that I'm a bad person. They always call me a bad person for everything I do. I'm trying to get over it and be for my friend, it's just really hard right now. I really do want the best for him and his girlfriend. They're really happy together.

People are almost always referring to the romantic compulsive behaviours that come with bpd, but never really the platonic connections and how deeply it stains your soul when a **friendship** could not prevail in the end. 

I have an *extremely* overactive brain and I find that when I start ruminating over my past friendships, I start spiralling in a very manic way. I’ll go to their pages, stalk them on burner accounts, I’ll even comment some mean and distasteful shit (nasty i know), compulsively call their # on no caller id and hang up. 

It’s all so fucking pointless but when i feel that obsession / compulsive coming on, i literally just start to watch myself do all of it instead of actually being physically present. I’m on medication for ocd, so on the day to day it keeps my mind off which is great for everyone around me ykwim. 

Was just wondering if anyone else struggles with this ritualistic & obsessively compulsive way?",1754563274.0,110,74,BPD,bpd
1mktaq9,Broke up with boyfriend with BPD - Looking for clarity,"I'm not looking to judge anyone, but the way things ended left me hurting. I posted in partner-specific subs, but everyone demonizes BPD there, and I don't resonate with that.

Recently broke up with boyfriend of 4 years. I saw it coming for about a month. Suddenly, it went from being great to feeling like he hates me. He'd make these long lists of everything I do wrong, most of it really blown out of proportion (you are immature because you cried when a wasp stung you).

I feel like out of nowhere he started basically hating me? Nothing I did was enough and everything I did was wrong.

At times it felt like I was going crazy, because he'd say things that are objectively not true ""you don't want to be with me, otherwise you would have moved in, do you know how alone I've been?"". And when I pointed out that we literally had plans for me to move in the next 2 months, he said it's not true and I'm just saying that.

He wasn't clingy or jealous. I was the more clingy one, he always had this attitude like he knew I'd never leave him, but would comment that I'm not there for him, without actually helping me understand how I can show up for him better. It always felt like just blaming me, not telling me a problem so we can fix it. It felt like a ""you hurt me, it doesn't matter what you do from now on, I can't forgive you"", so no matter how much I'd try it would be too late.

Towards the end I was trying really hard to be perfect, up to the point I'd have anxiety before he came home and checked the entire house to make sure nothing is ""wrong"". He'd go out of his way to tell me I'm a bad cook, driver etc. and all my attempts to fix that were met with a sort of ""too late, I don't believe you anymore"".

I'm really hurting, I love this man to pieces and I know he's not this cruel, mean man like in the end. He has been diagnosed with BPD but dismissed ""the label"". I think what I saw was splitting? I'm racking my brains to understand what I could have done before we broke up to stop this process.

One day he just came home to tell me he wants to be with other women, stone-faced, no emotions, felt like I was talking to an NPC. So I gathered my stuff and left. Blocked him everywhere because he kept trying to keep in contact, and I can't even look at his name right now.

I'm left wondering: Where have I gone wrong? What could I have done to prevent or stop the splitting? I love him very much, and it hurts to remember all the mean things he said to me.",1754654515.0,1,0,BPD,bpd

I wasn't diagnosed until my early 30s, and up until that point I had actually considered myself enough of an armchair psychologist that I thought I knew what BPD looked like, and how to spot it, and I would never have considered it a fit for myself. I was also diagnosed at the same time with ASPD, which I thought was even more ridiculous. Granted, my therapist went about discussing these diagnoses with me in a VERY clumsy way, but I just could not fathom that either of them described me at all.

Several years on, very long story short, I have slowly come to accept that these diagnoses fit my various behavioral patterns and pathologies to a tee. I had been in denial about a lot of things for a very long time.

1mkt12e,Why can't I stopppp,"I am an international student studying in a city in Europe. Recently, I got a notification from my dorm that I wasn't accepted as a student for the next semester.
That is when my crashout began. I started seeing a lot of apartments and instead of sticking to one place, I kept searching for new places. And kept running after landlords who didn't want foreigners as tennants.
Finally, I found a place. Good enough. A little out of my budget but would give me a stabel place to sleep and rest.
My sister lent me deposit money. I started having second thoughts about the place.
Now, I still had a month left at the dorm but in order to save money, I left the dorm early without having secured a place first.
Under pressure, I chose whatever option was available (I still could make this work by asking a friend to crash at their place. Airbnb to give myself some time. Literally beg the dorm again).
So in a rush, I chose whatever place I could get. Maybe I liked it cause the landlord ghosted me for a while which triggered the 'i must get this place' in me.
Anyways, I have stayed 3 nights in this place and it's a sensory hell. It's on a big street and I haven't slept or relaxed.
I talked to the landlady and she's agreed to give my deposit back cause it's in-season and she has other people queued. I will pay a small penalty. And will live as a visitor at the dorm for now.

Why the actual fuck would I do this to myself? I have a friend who started looking for places in August. Went to one viewing (which I tokd her about) and grabbed the place. She says she'll live in the dorm and move at the end of the month to avoid stressing herself out.
How tf do people do that? I did stg similar to when I lost my laptop. Kept buying and returning laptops and eventually bought a very cheap one from fb marketplace which doesn't even work and I still have to get a new one.

I am in therapy. I genuinely want to do better. But it's like I can't help it.

I am irritable, I have attitudes, I am easily offended/defensive, I’m hypersensitive and read into EVERYTHING imaginable, very very perceptive and observant. I overthink so much that it consumes my every waking thought. I gaslight myself every single hour of every single day. I create false scenarios in my mind that something negative is true and run w it only creating turmoil and severe anxiety for myself. I am going through psychosis it seems and it’s been almost 3 months that I’ve been going through this out of body feeling, mania/depression. It all started this year, and has gotten undoubtably worst since May. I am a fucking wreck. 

Every single job I’ve had (6, give or take) I usually get fired bc of my actions whether that be my attendance, my attitude/insufferable personality , quitting because I get crippling anxiety and can’t take going in anymore OR I get bored. I can’t be in healthy relationships w men as I am a f*cking looney. I can’t keep friends bc they end up realizing how insufferable I am.

I’m not a likable person anymore. I once was maybe, but I am so lost. I’m not even sure if this is JUST BPD, or something more (autism, adhd, OCD or all of it) . But I’m suffering so bad, that every day I cry myself to sleep now. It’s gotten gradually worst every year. I don’t want to be this scrooge of a person. I am lost. The people that I have met that have BPD don’t seem to be as nearly bad as me, given that they can keep a job, friends & have a good relationship w their family. I always feel I’m a severe case. I don’t think anyone is as insufferable as I am. 

I never tried medicine bc it scared me but recently I woke up w debilitating anxiety that I needed a change NOW. So I booked a psychiatry appointment & now am on Lamotrigine. Barely been 4 days. I’m hoping to god DBT therapy and this medicine works. I’m going to continue trying to get to the root of this, but I fear if I don’t find a solution I might not be here anymore.

 •••
i (19 f) was recently broken up with by my boyfriend (m 22) who is my bpd favorite person. i’m not sure where to start to be able to get over him. i can’t stop thinking about him and everything i loved. idk how to get this pain out of me healthy or unhealthy. i have been sh since our relationship ended. it’s not either of our faults the relationship ended but he’s arab muslim and he had family that pressured him into leaving me along with the stress of just getting out of college finding a job and doing long distance he couldn’t handle also fulfilling my emotional needs and decided to break things off with me. i naively keep holding onto false hope that he’ll come back because i was the first girl he told him mom about and he always talked about how much he liked me he just always tweaks out. at the end of the day we both didn’t do anything wrong he just realized he couldn’t care for me properly and led me on for a bit before breaking it off. lost on what to do it feels like i’ve lost my whole world and a big chunk of my heart. any advice on coping with this heartbreak would be greatly appreciated.

 •••

hello! i am a friend of op, and i am a semi-impartial third party who has proofread and subsequently offered relatively unbiased insight into the situation. i do not like this man. i do not believe that he respected my friend enough to be honest with her. he has voiced that he pities her, and i feel that is not characteristic of someone who is in a relationship for the right reasons. i believe he has a savior complex, knew of her state, and used it to his advantage until he could no longer. he stayed with her for the benefit of himself until he could no longer endure the guilt put on him by his faith, family, and ultimate effect he knew his actions would have on my friend. he is very avoidant-attachment style, while my friend is disorganized/anxious. a recipe for disaster. my poor baby. his flippancy in apology is very telling of his character and crippling fear of commitment. very bad apple.

from fall 2022 to oct 2023 I was mentally in the worst condition I ever have been. It was an extremely rough time of my life and it wasn't until I was diagnosed with bpd and bipolar 2 and treated for them that I finally was able to find some semblance of normalcy and feel like me again. 

But during this time I spent an ungodly amount of money, mostly from late 2022 to mid 2023. I'm talking thousands and I'm very embarrassed about it. Retail therapy was such a big problem.

Cut to today, finally on a set of meds that have made me more stable that I ever could think, and working in my  industry. I'm learning how to save my money and the logistics of it, and I'm so happy about the progress I've made in just the short couple months of this job. 

But when it comes to everyday purchases, I always feel so much guilt and like I don't need x y and z. I cleared out one of my storage cubbies as a snack drawer, but have only refilled it a couple times before I said ""this is silly I don't need this"". I live with my parents still and they wake up super early and go to bed early so walking past their door at 1am is not ideal (I get the midnight munchies and always have lol)

Even buying a slightly nicer soap like dr squatch as a treat feels so selfish, and I feel like I need to hide my mundane purchases from my family since they saw the whole phase. I think a box of froot by the foot is probably not the end of the world lol. 

I'm sure a lot of you have had a similar experience, how have you been able to be kinder to yourself after bouts of heavy money spending?

I drank a fair bit tonight, something I tend to do when I'm upset, usually beer or whiskey (a LOT) but tonight I drank two verrry large glasses of wine and then quite a lot of vodka.

At my grandma's house, my grandpa's old room is now my room. And tonight, I broke down in tears, crying about how much I missed him and how I wished he was still here.

I cried so much that I began feeling nauseous, and ended up going to the bathroom to make myself throw up so I wouldn't have to feel it anymore.

I just really needed to get this off my chest. I feel uncomfortable talking to people I know about my emotional disregulation and my self destructive tendencies, because they all give me that pitying look that I just can't stand. I want to be heard and seen, not pitied, like I have been for as long as I can remember.

I'm sorry if this is rambling - as I said, it's my first post, and I'd like to share this brief glimpse of my life with others who may understand, as grief with BPD so far has been an emotional rollercoaster that I absolutely hate, and as much as I've been trying to function in daily life, it's getting harder and harder to reel in how I'm feeling.

For context for this I have a slew of medical conditions, both mental and physical. The most important ones besides BPD of course is my developmental coordination disorder and flat feet which causes significant pain.

I recently started a job at Sonic, and at the start, while I was in severe pain due to my flat feet, I could handle it as I knew I'd get to being fine. All my coworkers were nice and understood when I told them I had BPD.

One day, a man comes in without a proper uniform on and no name tag, and pulls me aside for 'hobbling' while taking food in and out (for context I'm a carhop), saying I basically can't do that, as well as getting mad about a sloppy apron (I have developmental coordination disorder which affects my fine motor skills, I have a very hard time tying aprons for example).

I was able to get through the day but had to go home early due to extreme pain and I stayed home the next day due to feeling sick. When I was able to work again, one of my coworkers who was apparently banned from handling money (presumably by the owner) was kicked out and sent home, and I overheard the owner saying he might want to fire him.

I take a cash order (First day taking cash orders by the way) and the customer says ""Keep the change"" and drives off. I ask my boss about this and he flips out, basically saying I'm in the wrong and that it's stealing from the customer.

I almost start crying so I take a break, and after the break I take another cash only order, in which the customer also says keep the change. I ask explicitly if it's alright for me to, saying my manager said I can't. She looks shocked at me and comforts me, saying it's fine to keep all of it.

I ask another coworker who has been working there for years if it's alright, and she says she does the same thing about keeping all the change. I ask my boss again and he full on yells at me in front of everyone, and I lose my cool, yelling back, getting incredibly defensive.

This leads to me getting fired and getting banned, and I just now learned he's the owner of the Sonic. Before I met him everyone seemed happy and go lucky, for example I had to take a night shift and an employee was playfully scaring everyone and didn't get in trouble so it seemed like things were fine to do so, it really felt like he just wanted a reason to fire me and my BPD outburst was a legal reason. I already had told him about my condition and how it affects me, and I had planned to send a few website links and videos on BPD for him to understand more after work but I don't think I'll get to do that anymore.",1754544835.0,91,57,BPD,bpd

1mk4jdx,I think my boyfriend is done with me,"I (21F) think my boyfriend (25M) has emotionally checked out. We just hit one year, and I’m on a family trip, but he’s been distant. I asked him to send a voice note every night. He kept forgetting until I reminded him.

This afternoon I told him, “when I get to the Airbnb, can we play 8ball?” He said “okay,” but then later messaged “I’m tired.” I assumed he didn’t want to talk anymore, and I got upset. I told him I just wanted more affection and attention.

Some of the things I said were:

“It’s fine if you sleep… but you just go, ‘I love you goodnight’ without being affectionate or even asking what I’m doing.”
“I really just wanted more attention from you.”
“I wasn’t trying to throw my anger at you.”

He said I was attacking him, told me to “reflect,” and said I’m acting “stupid” and “unbelievable.” and to stop texting him. I didn’t insult him once. I was just hurt. Last time we argued was before the vacation, where I was crying to him and needed him to comfort me and he just said “maybe you should think about what you say before speaking.” without any reassurance afterwards. 

he recently has been using silence to hurt me. He knows it makes me really anxious, but he just leaves without fixing the argument. Whenever there’s an issue, he’s just been passive aggressive not even trying to understand me or fix it. When I asked him to apologize for belittling me, he said, “Goodnight. Sorry for the way you’re treating me.”

I think he’s done with me. I feel ashamed and too much. I feel so upset I ruined a good relationship by arguing so much. I understand it, I mean.. Who would be able to deal with someone like me? I’m just so sad and I don’t know what to do. All I can do is just blame myself",1754583654.0,10,48,BPD,bpd
1mkltrl,How can I reassure my bf?,"My (25f) boyfriend (31m) and I have been dating almost 6 months. He’s not diagnosed, but I think he has it. 

The first 2 months were amazing—he was perfect. He supported me while I got a protective order and started an investigation against my ex, who raped me and had serious mental health issues. He knew my ex had stalked me. My boyfriend was incredible during this time. We spent a lot of time together and I’d stay at his place for days. I told my family I met the man I was going to marry.

After 2 months, problems slowly started. He got upset when I fell asleep and didn’t respond for 3 hours. He asked me to let him know before I nap since he’s been cheated on before. I apologized and agreed. Later, he asked me to turn on read receipts and share my location. He knew I was hesitant because my ex used that to monitor me, but I agreed anyway to give him peace of mind.

Then he started accusing me of wanting to sleep with a coworker—one I liked platonically. I had reached out to his girlfriend once when he got arrested, just to offer support. For months he accused me of wanting that coworker, even though we only interacted at work. Then the accusations started about other coworkers I talked about Pokémon with (he has a girlfriend and is 6 years younger than me). Eventually, I quit my job because it caused too many problems in the relationship.

We used FindMy to share locations, but it drifted and he thought I was leaving the house when I wasn’t. I convinced him to let me pay for Life360 since it’s more accurate. 

He accused me of cheating when I stopped at a gas station after the grocery store and pharmacy without telling him. He asked me to inform him every time I leave, where I’m going, what I’m doing, and when I get home. I started doing that.

We’re both Pokémon Go players. I go to a park 1 minute from my house to play. He began accusing me of meeting someone there. He doesn’t want me to get out of my car at the park because someone might talk to me. He doesn’t like that people can see me from inside my car because they still might approach. I’ve started avoiding leaving the house much at all because it causes too many fights.

He’s driven 65mph in a 25mph zone while upset with me in the car.

One night, I told him not to come over—it was 1am—and said I wouldn’t come outside if he did. He told me later he had been driving over with a gun to shoot himself on my doorstep. He said if I didn’t respond, he’d “know” it was the right thing to do. He turned around before getting there and told me afterward.

I made him give me the key to his gun safe. Then I found out he had another key. I made him give me that. Then I found out he had another gun. I made him give me the ammo—turns out he had more. He has called me with a gun to his head five times. The last time, he cocked it and asked, “Did you hear that?” while I sobbed and begged him not to. I’ve called 911 before and texted my sister to send someone over the last time.

The accusations are multiple times a day. He tells me he knows I wouldn’t cheat, knows my heart, apologizes, and promises to get better. He’s seen his therapist twice in 1.5 months and started antidepressants a month ago.

He says he’s given me every reason to leave and that he knows I love him and wouldn’t cheat.

We’re supposed to go to a concert tomorrow. Last week, he said he was nervous and suggested we stick together the whole time—I agreed, except for the bathroom. I said I could go by myself. He then said we shouldn’t go at all, because he doesn’t trust me to go to the bathroom alone for 5 minutes. That men would hit on me and I wanted to give them the opportunity to do so.

I asked for space yesterday. He demanded I keep sharing my location and turn read receipts back on (he’s shared/unshared his location about 20 times in the last 4 days). He agreed to space, but still expects me to let him know when I leave, where I go, and why I’m not texting as much. I keep asking him to give me space. I need time to think without fighting. 

How can I give him peace of mind while I take a few days to reset? Is there anything I can do to soothe him? I’m desperate. Thank you if you read all this.",1754627581.0,0,5,BPD,bpd

1mkgvle,it's been 7 years since my diagnosis.,"after many years of struggling with BPD, pre diagnosis and post- i am coming to share how i feel now at 25 (F)

  
i was never nice to myself, my self esteem was so low as a teenager and young adult. i was always seeking outside validation, hypersexual in all ways. i couldn't help but attach to anyone that showed me a sliver of love. i would lose control constantly. in a way that was so indicative of how i suffered with my own mind an feelings towards myself.

  
today, i am not coming to tell you that i'm fully healed, but it got more manageable. i wanted to share with my fellow bpd siblings to be gentle. be gentle with yourself. your mind deserves it. regardless of age, u will constantly grow and evolve. a lot of us are self aware, and don't give ourselves enough credit for it. you deserve happiness. though i haven't found my happiness completely, i can confidently say, i am no longer the wildfire i once was. more of a contained passionate flame. 

  
i feel that bpd has caused me to suffer nonstop, but at this point- 25.... i know i'm fucking awesome. emotional, sensitive, full of depth, layered, open ENOUGH. i hope you know that you are enough. i hope you know it wont always feel like THAT. it wont always claw at every inch of your body and mind. 

there is so much love out there, and the love you have for yourself is waiting for u, calling your name. smiles n all. lol idk if im making sense, but i felt called to make a post to u all. sending the most love. <333 ",1754613008.0,2,0,BPD,bpd
1mkl4ts,Forgetting things from a split,"Hello! I was wondering if it is normal to forget certain things that I have felt, said or thought during a split. This ""memory loss"" has been happening rather recently - I split at someone over something small, distance myself from them and tell myself that they don't care about me anymore. I wait for them to approach me and to realize I've been distant and avoiding them, and if they don't text me at all, it'll just confirm what my head is telling me. If they text me saying they notice I'm distant and that they love me and care for me and are not leaving, for me to reply back whenever I feel capable of it, etc, I can have the split ending rather quickly afterwards. I am constantly testing the people I split on to see if they talk to me, and I absolutely hate doing it, but it's still very hard to control it. I need constant reassurance that people are not leaving me.

Thing is, a day or two later when I think back at what happened, I suddenly realize I don't remember the things I was telling myself about said person. I remember I was upset at them, and that I couldn't bring myself to talk to them at all, but I don't remember all the other thoughts that crossed my mind, it's weird to explain. I remember breaking down crying for 2 days (roughly the time that the last splitting episode lasted), but I don't recall a thing about what was crossing my mind at the time. Then I start thinking ""but all is well now, they really do care about me, and I love talking with them so much, why couldn't I speak to them for something simple? I know they care, they've shown it, was I exaggerating everything in my head or faking it?"", it's awful. I start spiraling and overthinking when the split is already over, thinking I was faking the whole thing because I don't remember the details of how I felt towards the person I was splitting on and things being okay now.",1754625422.0,1,0,BPD,bpd
1mkl30l,Relationship ended because of me,"I was recently broken up with by my boyfriend of ~ two years because he could not deal with my behavior towards him anymore. I fully recognize how toxic and mean I was to him for pretty much no reason. I knew I was those things immediately after I would blow up on him, but I could never control those emotions in the moment or prevent them from happening in the future. These outbursts of anger always happened when I was insecure or worried about him not caring about me anymore. I would let stupid things like this make me feel resentment, and I was not giving him the words of affirmation, compliments, and affection that I should have been. Even if there was objectively nothing wrong or if I truly did agree with him on things, I always got angry. I have realized now that these things, again, were rooted in insecurity and fear. I would say mean things instead of just express my true feelings. Whether it was giving him silent treatment or storming off, nothing I did was healthy and I understand why he left. I have been like this all my life with close family members, and I know that a lot of this goes back to the way I was raised- without much affection and a lot of yelling. 

I never admitted to myself that I needed help, but becoming so close to someone and spending so much of my time with them brought this out to an extreme and was a wake up call, and I am now starting therapy. I am absolutely aware that this was my fault. He is genuinely everything that I have ever wanted in a partner in every single way and I cannot believe I let myself lose such an amazing person. I cannot ever see myself finding someone as attractive and perfect as him. I want him back, not right this second since I know I need help first, but I know I can’t force it, especially since he has made it clear that his mind is made. He did not want a break, and he fully believes there is someone better for him out there which is so painful to hear, since I know that with time, I could be that person for him. He expressed wanting to have a conversation in the future and possibly being friends, but I feel like he is just saying that to make it easier and in time he will just move on and not want those things. 

I have not been officially diagnosed with BPD, and I am not claiming to have it and self-diagnose. However, I know for certain that I my behaviors do match some of the symptoms of it, and wanted support from others that have experienced something similar. I would appreciate any support or wisdom on how to heal from this breakup, especially knowing it was my fault, how to regulate my emotions and make steps towards genuine change, and how I can eventually prove to him that with therapy, accountability, and work, I can be different and have him give me the chance to show that, and if I can’t do that, how to move on. 

There’s so much to this and I know I forgot some key points but any insight is appreciated:) Please note that I take full accountability for my actions and am completely aware that there is no excuse for them. It is so painful knowing that I could have been more self aware and gotten help sooner, but I know there is a tendency for people to blame everything on their mental health, especially on this subreddit, and I don’t want to do that.

1mkjcy4,Dealing with a breakup,"Hello,
My ex (18M) recently broke up with me (18F) the other day. We were together for almost two years, and to be completely honest, I was very controlling and manipulative. Any argument would blow up, and I had complete black-and-white thinking. I mostly threatened to hurt myself so he would comfort me. I was extremely insecure about everything—sadly, even things like game cosmetics.

Recently, he broke up with me, saying that I put too much stress on him. Any time an argument happened, he would worry himself sick about me. He often couldn’t sleep and felt like he had to stay up to resolve the problem and make sure I was okay. He also feels like he can’t be his true self or make dumb jokes about game characters when I’m around. So, he broke up with me, saying that now he just wants to focus on school, work, and his friends—one of whom is moving away for college, so he wants to spend time with them.

I’ve been incredibly depressed and suicidal these past few days. We’ve kept in contact, and I can’t stop asking if he’s going to replace me or if we could ever get back together. He says he’s not thinking about stuff like that right now; he wants to focus on school. He isn’t thinking about relationships or pursuing other women. When I asked if we could ever get back together, he said he isn’t sure. He said, “If we align, then we align and can try again,” but he’s not sure if he wants to do that. He says he isn’t sure about anything and just wants to focus on school. I asked him if he would try to move on from me or just focus on school, and he said he’s going to try and move on.

What do I do? I’ve realized all my mistakes and wrote a long paragraph to him apologizing for causing so much stress and for making him feel like he had to walk on eggshells around me. We still keep in contact, and we now work at the same place. I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I genuinely don’t want to keep living. My whole world is falling apart.

But at the same time, I genuinely want to change and learn to deal with this stuff. I want to be a better person. I want to prove to him that I can get better at dealing with my problems and emotions, in hopes of getting back together. But my question is: where do I start?

Are there any tips or advice that have helped you?

I also want help coming to terms with the fact that people can be in a relationship and still find other people pretty. He said that to me before—that sometimes he finds a girl pretty in the same way he finds his mom pretty—but my mind can’t understand that. It just makes me feel like he never found me attractive.

I’m sorry for this mess of a post. I’m very new and just wanted to vent and ask for advice. Any advice for moving on, learning to deal with self-esteem and insecurities, and learning how to cope with emotions—and just take a step back so I don’t bombard someone with all of my feelings?

1mk3v0o,BPD girlie with a DID boyfriend 😬,"Hey, new to the sub, but I’ve (f30) been diagnosed with BPD for about 5 years now, and I just started a new relationship with my bf (m31) who lives with DID (dissociative identity disorder).  

I knew about his diagnosis before we started dating, so I knew what I was getting myself into, and we are constantly trying to work on our communication so that when difficult moments come up, we’re in the best situation to handle it.  Unfortunately, these disorders seem to love wreaking havoc!  🫣😅.  There have been times where my abandonment issues have flared up, because he couldn’t wake up from a ptsd nightmare, and I’m doing my best to regulate myself, and not put the burden onto him.  It’s not perfect, but we’ve been doing alright making it through. 
Last night he had a distinct and clear DID switch while we were making plans to hang out today though.  And I haven’t heard a peep from him since.  I want to give him whatever space he needs to work through what’s going on right now, but I’m also kind of worried.   I know there have been times in his past where the DID came into play, and he disappeared from everyone’s lives for months at a time, not remembering anything, and then one day just pops back up like “where the f*ck am I?  What month is it?”  I know he doesn’t have control in this situation, it’s a trauma response to help him cope through times of extreme distress.  But this is the first time it’s happened like this in our relationship, and I WANT to be there for him and support him.  But I’m also scared that I’ll do the wrong thing and make it worse.  Or by leaving him alone I’ll make it worse because I didn’t make sure he KNEW that I’m here to support him, and love EVERY part of him.

I know that we need to have a talk when we’re both in a good mental state to figure out how we can best handle the situation as it comes up moving forward, but damn, right now I’m having a very difficult time determining if I’m acting out of BPD fears, or as a caring gf.

I know this is a BPD sub, so none of us are exactly experts on handling DID, but any advice on how to manage my own BPD and keep it from getting out of control when the abandonment fears are getting triggered like this would be so greatly appreciated!

In case it wasn’t clear, I have nothing against BPD, DID, or the people who live with either, I only want to better understand and support in order to develop as healthy a relationship as we can.

1mk3y4o,Is it possible to have ADHD ASD and BPD at the same time?,"Hi, so I was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD 1 as an adult but I was wondering if I might BPD too and I’m not asking you to diagnose me, but asking a question if it is possible or common to have all three or there’s a possibility I might’ve been misdiagnosed with something. So I have all ADHD and ASD symptoms and always had since childhood and I even have some specific symptoms in both diagnosis. I also have all the BPD signs and symptoms and had them for a while, since I was a teen. But I just have a feeling that I might be faking everything and like I’m those people on tik tok who diagnose themselves and I really don’t want to be like this but at the same time I struggle a lot. My psychologist actually sees my impulsivity like both ADHD related and something more he even wants me to test about it somehow and talk more about it I have extreme mood swings from crying feeling nothin and hopeless to feeling euphoric and dancing and singing to music in literally 5-10 minutes I get triggered a lot by what other people do and I split people I experience extreme hatred towards myself or other people or the whole world my emotions are too much sometimes and idk if it’s BPD or just my ADHD and autism.

I’m really sorry if it seems like I want you to get me diagnosed here but I don’t, I just want to know if there are people who were diagnosed with all three disorders and if they’re like sure they have all three and it’s not a misdiagnose. I don’t know anybody who has all three, not a single celebrity or a YouTuber, I mean there are a lot of people with AuDHD on YouTube bot not AuDHD and BPD.

1mkfudg,I have big Trauma associated with my diagnosis from childhood and running out of hope. Any advice? Words of affirmation?,"Hi- I don’t like to write about this in detail so I’m going to try my best. Edit: after rereading this, it truly is high level, though I apologize for any triggers throughout. As the flair states, cw: suicide. 

My parents “misdiagnosed” me with BPD when I was too young to technically start displaying the traits (8, 9 y/o) because they didn’t want a daughter with ADHD or autism. Unfortunately, through their actions and the infamous “walking in eggshells” content, they did eventually emotionally abandon me and I did develop real BPD. 

They blocked me from therapists that would actually help because they knew I would “talk poorly about them” aka tell the therapist about the verbal and physical (lite) abuse happening in our home, and the emotional abandonment that I was too young to understand. Eventually, around 29 y/o, I attempted suicide and failed. Some days I’m happy about that, but lately I really wish it had worked. After being traumatized by therapists who didn’t actually have the intent to help me with tools like CBT and DBT, I really struggle to regulate and to see the point of living. 

I’m 32 y/o now, married, estranged from my entire family and living on the other side of the continent. I haven’t been able to work since the attempt, and haven’t been able to find a therapist willing to work with me long term. I literally just got dumped by my latest therapist out of nowhere over the weekend. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I like to think there’s a version of me in a different universe or timeline who had loving parents and sisters, and who doesn’t walk around wishing they weren’t alive. I can barely function without marijuana because of physical pain, migraine, and anxiety. My energy levels are so low, and I have no appetite or desire to eat or drink. I can’t even sleep through the night anymore. I’m so tired of living in this body, with this mind. I can’t even meditate anymore without my thoughts absolutely racing. I can’t leave the house. I just want to hide. 

Second edit: I also have PTSD and cPTSD, which isn’t uncommon; my memories have been slowly coming back and exacerbating the pain I’m experiencing. I have terrible nightmares and that probably contributes to my exhaustion. 

Can someone — anyone — tell me there is hope?

1mkftw3,Tired of Neurotypical Ignorance,"It feels like every time someone shows an ounce of empathy toward people with BPD, someone has to be all like, “They shouldn’t get close to anyone unless they’re healed/getting treatment!” I’m tired of hearing it. I’m sorry your jealous ex girlfriend hurt you, but we shouldn't all have to answer for that. Your trauma doesn’t give you the right to spread stigma and decide that nobody else deserves any compassion.

And like. People say that stuff as if getting treatment for BPD is easy. As if we’re just *choosing* not to get better. Trust me, if there were a magical button that could make it all go away, most of us would’ve pressed it a long time ago. But recovery isn’t easy. Therapy is expensive, hard to access, and a lot of times out of reach unless you have the right combination of money, insurance, transportation, and autonomy. Some people rely on parents or caretakers and can't even decide to get treatment on their own. And even if you have those things, you still have to find a therapist who understands you, who you actually click with, and not everyone even gets that choice due to things like their location, funds, or lack of control over their circumstances. Not only that, but you have to be in treatment for a long time to get anywhere, and not everyone has the opportunity to do that. And that's assuming you even get diagnosed at all, since BPD gets confused with a lot of other disorders.

And even then, once you’ve found the right support, it’s not an instant fix. Healing takes time. You have to figure out what works for you, the right coping tools, lifestyle changes, medications, therapy types. Then you actually have learn how to use them in real life. It’s slow and it's messy. And acting like people with BPD should live like fucking monks, isolated away from everyone else, until they’re perfectly healed just because their struggles are “inconvenient” to others is cruel. You can't really heal your relationships with other people when you're isolated in the first place. Yes, relationships (both romantic and platonic) trigger us. But isolation from other people is dangerous to your mental AND physical health. Telling people that they have to isolate to be a good person is inhumane.

No one deserves to be abused, but that doesn’t justify demonizing an entire group of people. Not everyone with BPD is abusive. Most of us have been abused and are vulnerable to abuse ourselves. Treating us all like we’re inherently dangerous only deepens the stigma and makes it harder for people to reach out and get help in the first place. And if people have to gripe about us, I wish they'd stick to places meant for that and leave us alone.",1754610121.0,1,2,BPD,bpd

The past couple months have been pretty rough on me with my grandfather (who is like my father) passing away unexpectedly. With the inheritance of the responsibility’s he held Ive been very stressed out and busy. This has led me to not being as patient as I normally am. Thats no excuse to be irritated though. 

A day after I went there she started texting me again. She asked me to come over for the night and to bring her some candy for cramps so I did. We hung out and had a good night and she was (seemed) happy and normal like we used to be.

She did the same thing the next night as well and I brought her over a curtain she forgot to get at the store.

Long post incoming:

Hey y’all. I’m seeking some advice. I’ve recently been diagnosed with BPD after being discharged from the psych ward because of trying to kill myself. N before y’all say that’s “on brand”, y’all better hear me out🙄: I never expected myself to ever be diagnosed with BPD. I do have a bit of a list of mental health issues and I’ve even been diagnosed with autism cuz I’ve been pushing for it and my therapist is saying she’s worried I might have OCD. But BPD was totally out of left field because I figured I had more control of my emotions I guess? I don’t even consider myself clingy, it’s actually the opposite where I’m more hyper independent. I’m freaking out because BPD isn’t like anxiety or depression where it’s more “acceptable”. It’s not even like DID where you’ll get maybe some ignorant people, but a lot of folks don’t even know it. I’ve seen BPD demonized everywhere; it’s demonized as much as NPD, just the “”crazier”” version. I know y’all aren’t psychologists so I’m not asking if I’ve missed any signs although I have been looking through this sub to read about the experiences with it, but my question is who should I talk to? Because I’ve only been at the psych ward for a day and a half, but I must’ve shown some symptoms. Should I talk to my therapist? I barely talk to her now due schedules clashing.

1mkedn5,Horrified because my ex is scared of me now.,"I screwed up.

So my ex is friends with my roommates/friends. They were actually the ones who introduced us. But ever since our breakup, he hasn't come over to their house because I'm here. And he blocked me on all social media and didn't want to speak to me. 

Well, hes had a few visits over recently because our friends told him my work schedule so he could safely come over and spend time with them while I'm at work.

And up until now, it was completely fine.

But what I did next was wrong and I really shouldn't have done this. But I did it anyways.

I lied and said I had a full shift, and I took a half day. I was pretending to be ignorant that my ex would be visiting because I wanted to apologize to him in person.

Well, I drive home and I park outside on the street and I see his car parked in the driveway of our friends house/my place.

I walked into the room and saw them all sitting at the table and my ex was smiling.

Until his eyes looked up and he saw me and I saw them instantly change.

Immediately he started shaking and breathing heavily and stood up from the table trying to back away.

I wasn't expecting that reaction at all, I know I....hurt him a lot during my split to the point it was considered emotional and mental abuse. But I didn't realize it hurt him THAT bad.

On instinct I remember he liked hugs, so not thinking, I started to walk forward towards him. But he just scrambled away terrified telling me to stay away. And I froze because his voice sounded GENUINELY terrified.

Our friends got between us and JJ (Guy friend) took me to one end of the house and HH (Girl friend) took him to the other end off the house.

JJ starts tearing into me because 'What the heck did you think you were doing?! Why didn't you tell us you were coming home!"" 

I tried to say I just wanted to apologize in person but JJ let me know just...how badly I screwed up, and I'm gonna paraphrase what he said here.

""BB.....when you said all that stuff to him when you broke up, you used all his triggers against him. He was SA'd years ago, and everything you said to him at the end was almost EXACTLY the same as what his abuser said to him. You ABUSED him. And now he can't look at you without associating you with the abuse. Hes SCARED. And the reason why we had him coming over at seperate times was to AVOID stuff like this. But you just BETRAYED the trust we had in you, and now you've probably scared him to the point hes going to be scared of hanging out with us!'

1mjzzs1,Inconsistency with taking meds,"Does anybody else with BPD have issues and struggle with remaining consistent in taking their meds? 

What are some things I can do to stay on-top of them? 

I (F20) find that whenever I’m in a episode, or sometimes in general I don’t take my meds due to the fact that I feel just.. fine, and that I can “manage” off of them.. I am then.. normal.

I cannot manage off meds, but I can’t keep taking them. 

When I do begin taking them again, I feel controlled or as if it’s stupid for me to be on them simple because “I don’t need them” because I have always been self aware of my behaviors, only issue is.. being self aware has never stopped my behaviors, outbursts or reckless impulsivity. 

Why do I have this on and off hatred and negativity towards medication? 

Another Note: I have just moved to a different state and have a bottle of medication with me that I’m supposed to be taking everyday. But I don’t, due to the fact I’m scared to run out, because what if I need them although I don’t like them.

I am pretty self aware and understand why I need them. The last time I stopped taking them, it took less than two days for me to fully crash and relapse on impulsive, reckless behaviors. 

I am also just a stay at home wife right now, so I don’t go out much as I used to or have reason to crash out despite my emotional deregulation. I just can’t seem to keep up the logic over how I inconsistently feel about medication.

1mkbl9m,Worried about my pwBPD idealizing me and neglecting her needs,"Tldr: the main question is at the very bottom. Everything other than that is just details about our relationship because I want to see if I could improve more. 

I love my ldr girlfriend deeply and I worry a lot about my influence on her. We've been together for a year. She'd been in therapy for some time, she currently doesn't have enough money for it but she really does her best. Before everything I say here, I'm autistic and I'm very very anxious, I take negative or neutral things very literally but I almost always take positive things as sarcasm and mockery (I'm working on that). She's also autistic but she had to learn all the social rules the hard way.

For reference how literally I take everything, she confessed to me in May but she was drunk and told me to forget it, and since I perceived her as flirty with everyone, I thought she literally was embarrassed because she didn't mean it. In August I confessed to her, seriously thinking she was going to reject me.

Ever since we've started dating and I first learned more about quiet BPD I really wanted to take it seriously to not let myself get caught up in the highs nor see the lows as the end of the world, to always consider how she feels first and foremost, to be honest about my boundaries and gentle.

I thought it'd be easy to establish what she wanted, if I just asked like ""it's okay if you want me to be persistent or say certain things, just tell me"", I felt uneasy when she'd always reply with ""do what comes naturally to you"", ""you should never change yourself for anyone ever, you'll meet the perfect person"", ""you're perfect, you can do no wrong"" I'd often think she's sarcastic, then try to sympathize with her, feeling deeply sad because the only thing those words meant to me was her extremely low self esteem and fear of abandonment. I usually tried to gently agree to disagree and do my best to not encourage this behavior. 

In fact I'd react positively to her being mean to me during splits like ""finally she's honest with me"" until I realized that ""you're a masochist, it's impossible to start a conflict or argue about anything with you"" isn't a compliment.

Then later on (March-April) I found out that my lack of persistance didn't feel like giving her space, it felt like abandoning her, no matter how many ""I love you forever, I'll wait for you"" I'd write. Me taking every ""no"" seriously also hurt her. Turned out that she felt very uncomfortable with sharing how she wants to be treated because she wants to be chased and for the other person to find the best approach to her by themself.

So I thought I finally understood what she wanted, even if it didn't come to me as naturally, I showered her with sweet nothings, sexy comments, she'd tell me ""Where were you hiding all of that?"" and I thought finally I wasn't fucking up, I was making her feel loved like she deserved.

But June came around and I made her split again, this time I did what I thought was my best: calling her, chasing her, writing lots of messages. But it ended with her telling me ""don't say 'I love you' to me. I only like it when I'm the one saying it to you. Don't lie to me, I don't need it, just let me observe you, that's all I want"". I thought it was a part of the split but even after that she said ""I can tolerate it and pretend I believe it when people say that sometimes but not when you do it so persistently."" I asked her about her words in April, she told me ""don't believe everything I say, it's one of the things that only feel good when you fantasize about them because every time you hope that this time will be different"" 

I really want to reciprocate her energy and accept her love properly even if it feels dangerous I know she means no harm ever. I like showing love but being loved so sincerely is like holding a newborn in your arms except I feel terror when I'm in one room with a child, like I don't deserve such purity but I have to be an adult and protect it if I want to be her wife.

Since words of affirmation aren't allowed, I try to compensate with things like attention in general, drawing portraits of her or us together, taking initiative, self handicapping when playing games, being curious about her interests, discussing our future, those things really work, I feel lighter when I make her smile for what I do for her.

Still I'm progressively more anxious the more she idealizes me and denies my responsibility when I fuck up because I just don't know how to respond in a way that won't encourage her but won't sound dismissive either. I understand that it won't change overnight or over a year, or over 5 years, but I feel like as her partner I should always seek the best way to not worsen her mental state. I'm working on throwing away my ego, learning how people feel connected since I just lack that.

So... What's the best way to behave during the idealization faze, so that it won't influence her negatively?",1754599648.0,0,0,BPD,bpd
1mkbfoi,BPD woman thinking about having children,"I (F 37) have BPD and my worst triggers are romantic relationships. I seem to get entirely engulfed in them and sacrifice all of my mental, physical and financial wellbeing to trying to make romantic relationships work. I tend to choose unstable partners with narcissistic traits which doesn’t help. I’m really trying to choose better and live better and am thinking (as I get older) that I’d like to have children, build a loving family and that is very much factoring into the type of person I feel I should choose in the future. However, I’m terrified by the thought of causing pain and instability to children I bring into the world. My parents were incredibly unstable as an individuals and as a couple and I do not want to repeat the cycle. I accept that it might be most responsible to choose not to have them, but am wondering if there are any good books or podcasts I could delve into regarding, specifically, being a GOOD parent with BPDs.",1754599287.0,1,0,BPD,bpd

I know grief is a SoB, and I’ve been dating him for 3 years (our anniversary was supposed to be at the end of this month lmao), but it still hurts. I wish I could be mad at him but it was a respectful and gentle conversation. We both cried and there may be a time in the future where we get back together (my biggest hope bc none of this feels real), but he’s unsure when that will be and as someone who gets anxious w no timeline yall can imagine how that feels for me lol. I hold nothing against him realistically. I could harp on all the times I split on him, or other things we argued about prior, but I don’t want to bc we were doing so good these last few weeks, I genuinely didn’t think we’d get here.

I’m really stuck right now, because I cannot think for myself and what would make me feel better.

he stated he's not talking to anyone else, and that he's in ""online gaming snap groups"" and does streaks

honestly i didn't believe him, so i made him promise that i was the only one he's snapping. he did! he could've cut me off for being too controlling. I told him I have BPD and may freakout again, but he said its okay, stayed and reassured me, so i took it that's he's serious and decided to trust him

1mjy15u,Could employment trigger my BPD?,"Hi all, 

A quick bit of context, I am currently unemployed (by choice) as my previous job was making me depressed and I wanted a change in career. I’ve taken 2 months off in-between and still have about 3 weeks of unemployment left. 

Context done- Since my unemployment (i’m about a month and a bit in) I have had 1 BPD flare up… 
Whilst I was working, I was lucky if it was 1 flare up a week. I’m starting to wonder if being employed is a huge trigger for my bpd. I’m 22 and have been working since I was 16, this is the first time in 6/7 years that I have had a decent amount of time off from working and just so happens that my BPD has calmed down dramatically. 

I’m now worried that come September when I start up my new job, I will fall back into old behaviour and attitudes. I have never felt more sure of myself and genuinely regulated as I have this past month or so. 
I would say my 1 flare up I had during my time off- was due to a family member passing as well and feeling trapped with how to express my emotions regarding this. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences with employment and BPD? Any advice regarding this too? 
As I said, I’m now worried to start my new job incase I fall straight back into old patterns! ",1754567686.0,4,1,BPD,bpd

i also feel violated by the fact that they’re all know where i’d gone. i don’t have any trackers on my phone, didn’t tell anyone yet i wake up and they’re just … there with their pity. i’m so fucking ANGRY that the police raiding my own private bedroom and went through all my journals. i’m so so so angry and ashamed. god i wish i could leave this fucking place. it makes me cringe to know everyones read my journals and notes. my entire life i’ve had NO PRIVACY at all. not one single thing i ever get for myseld. not even my own private journals. how dare the police raid through my drawers ??? 

& now everyone has left me due to my aggressive behaviour and im in a dark enclosed hospital bed alone. i beg for help and for someone to save me , yet i reject and abuse all attempts everyone makes. i dont know why im so sick in the head that their empathy makes me angry, rather than feeling grateful that someone cares. i switch between to the two - clinging onto people and adoring them to despising them and wishing they’d just fuck off forever. all this failed attempt has done is made me realise how peaceful it is to sleep for so long and not have to live. it’s just motivated me to try again but smarter next time with NO NOTE. it’s gonna be so fucking awkward when i’m forced to go home. i’m sick of the trap that is my mind. since very young ive always prayed someone would beat my ugly head to death to make it all stop.

1mk864z,Help me change myself for my boyfriend/relationship,"I **(22M),** and my boyfriend **(25M),** have been together for just over a year.

We moved in together early on, and recently got our own apartment. Before meeting him, I never wanted a long-term relationship, but being with him has motivated me to get my life together (both for myself and for our future as a couple).

That’s why it’s so confusing that the person I love most in this world is also the person I lose my shit with the fastest. The second something gets tough, I snap. I lose complete control of myself and treat him in ways that honestly at this point is just abusive.

Since the beginning, I’ve struggled to manage myself during arguments. I told him early on that I’ve always had a short fuse with the people I’m closest to. He’s been very clear with me that’s not an excuse, and it’s not okay to treat him like this. Which he is 100% right about.

He feels like I don’t respect him, and that if I truly understood how hurtful I’m being, I would change. From my end, it feels like I *can’t* stop myself when I’m upset. I react before I even realize what I’m doing. I usually come to my senses after a few minutes (sometimes it's more immediate), and I try to apologize, take accountability, and just fix things. But the damage is already done.

1mjji0e,‘You’re too stable to have BPD’,"Genuine words from a healthcare professional the other day.

I feel like I HAVE to rant about this because I’m so angry about it.

I’ve been being passed around mental health services for a while now, because I’m considered too complex for the basic services, but not complex enough for the specialised services, so it’s just been in limbo.

After a stint in hospital, I was referred to my GP’s ‘health and wellbeing’ service, which I thought would be great! I met with the initial consultant who was making sure I was like eligible / would fit the criteria, and he was so kind and affirming and lovely. Genuinely the best session I’ve had.

Then, I got passed on to speak with an ‘Occupational Therapist’ (I say this in quotations just because I’m not sure what that really is?)

And oh my god. It was the single most invalidating experience I’ve had in healthcare.

Immediately when we started talking, she told me that I should ‘get BPD removed from my record and go for an autism diagnosis instead’, which I kind of just glossed over because I wasn’t sure what to say.
 
We had a 50 minute session. Just the one. In this she told me:
> ‘I was too stable to have BPD because I have a job and a boyfriend’
> ‘She’s worked with plenty of women with BPD before and I’m too ‘high functioning’ to be ‘like that’
> She was constantly laughing and saying ‘oh yeah that’s autism’ (baring in mind, I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist after multiple visits and have had my diagnosis upheld for a few years now)
> ‘I’m clearly not a very emotional person because I didn’t get emotional during our session’


I went there to see if I would qualify for some kind of therapy. And instead I left being told the diagnosis that I’ve had for years, that has helped me understand myself, had enabled me to get help, is actually incorrect because this women who met me for less than an hour said so.

I walked out feeling so invalidated. The way she presented it, because I wasn’t screaming and crying hysterically in front of her, because I’m able to go to work, I must actually be completely fine and not struggling the way I’m actively explaining to her.

I came out and immediately called my boyfriend SOBBING. He was so so so so angry on my behalf and is looking at making an official complaint.

I’m meant to have more sessions with her and I’m currently actively ignoring her texts trying to book me in because I’m so just upset and angry at her. Everytime I think about it I just want to scream and cry and everything.

It feels like his healthcare professional followed the stigma that people with BPD are messy, manipulative, crying wrecks who sabotage every relationship they touch and can’t hold down a job or behave in therapy. And what because I didn’t present that in the 50 minutes I was there I must actually just not have a problem?

Sorry, just wanted to rant i’ve got no one to talk about this to, I’ve already nattered my boyfriends war off about it and I’ve got no one else to discuss either

1mk7e66,I need a change.,"My spirals have gone way to far recently. I've isolated, said and done hurtful things, and need it to stop. I've ruined way too many relationships with irrational thoughts, consistently for about 3 years. I've been fighting it for so long and have barely seen a change, other than being able to internalize the rapid emotions more.

Specifically, I want to change for my partner and friends I've hurt along the way.
I keep notes during splitting and ""calmer"" moments. And have noticed a pattern of idolizing and villanizing the people in my life with little to no middle ground. In the villanizing moments, they are seen as threats. I withdrawal from any interaction, feel uncontrollable anger and hatred alongside many other flooding emotions, and treat them coldly. Almost shutting them out completely.
I know when this is happening that it could be a split, that, or just irrational emotions. But it still feels so real. I know I may get told to control my response, not the reaction, but I've tried. 

During the idolizing, I view them as the best person in the world. Only seeing their positive traits and thinking back on all the good things they've done for our relationship! I want nothing more than to be with them. One of the only periods of time I long for another person's presence. Neither stage is healthy, and I really want to learn how to control potential splitting, and the rapid emotions.

At times, it feels like there's two people in my head. Constantly fighting like two children over a toy. Except they are both fighting to make a different decision. It's exhausting - I half dont have the energy to change. But if I want to keep the people in my life, especially my partner, it needs to be done.
My family doesn't understand when I try to explain. Neither do my other friends.

Currently, me and my partner are on a pause. Still communicating regularly, but to give her space to breathe and be safe from this, and for me to learn to manage it. It was a mutual decision, wouldn't like thoughts on this. I don't offer much good to our relationship and I am going to correct that.

I want to learn how to change for her. For the friends I've cut off, the people I've hurt. My life feels out of control, and I dont want my years to be spent stressing over this.

Most likely can not attend DBT therapy, and I've seen that as a common suggestion. I know how much people might lose their minds over a minor professionally diagnosed with BPD, but do know, I am in psychiatric care, diagnosed there. Please, if anyone has tips on how to better myself, or at least improve how I treat others, please let me know. I can't keep going like this. 

Note: currently, my psychologist is unavailable to contact until about October-November. Been without therapy since about June? Dont know if I'm willing to start over with someone else.",1754590047.0,1,0,BPD,bpd

I’ve been healing from a prior abusive relationship and this was the first person I genuinely felt safe around in 2 years now. Again, I was under the impression everything was going fine with this new situation. Mind you, he is going into his last year of his PhD and ultimately comes from another country and would likely be going back there after graduating (we’re in Canada but he’s from the US). So even when things first started I obviously thought hard about all the alternatives should things continue to go well (will he leave eventually? Would I move to the US? Am I going to handle being left should things not work out? Am I expecting someone to put their career on the line? Etc etc). But I pushed all of that aside because I felt safe in the current moment. Last weekend he pulled the “what are we card” on me and I opened up and let myself be vulnerable about my feelings towards him. He reciprocated but with the caveat of he doesn’t know what’s going to happen in the future (which again, I’ve already ruminated on already lol). We kind of left things at that. Fast forward to yesterday, he sends me a text message basically saying he’s sorry for ignoring me but he’s going through some things and needs to be by himself. This now has me spiralling. Did I do something wrong? Does he hate me? Is he leaving me? Does he not want me? I keep telling myself it’s because there’s so many planets in retrograde and he’s an Aquarius with an avoidant attachment style (lol) but this is just a funny way for me to cope and trust me it is not working.

That year of travel turned out to be full of heart break and rapid mental health decline until I had a huge breakdown and had to fly home after a year in Australia. I had no idea why I decided to go there in the first place - it was as if I had dissociated the entire time and a different person was making decisions for me. I was diagnosed with BPD aged 20 and didn't get to uni until I was 21. Even though I completed my degree in the subject I would have studied had I gone to uni earlier, I feel like I have never reconnected with the path I was supposed to be on due to those 3 years lost between sixth form and uni.

My boyfriend is really the only person I have and I’d like to change that but idk how.. making friends have always been so hard and I’ve always been convinced I won’t find friendships like two that I had growing up, it’s hard to let myself be open.. 
 
A little about me, I like all kinds of art, read books, play video games, ride/work w horses, spiritual, have 3 dogs(pitty breeds), I have a streetbike, obsessed w fantasy things, cooking/baking. Am currently going thru a difficult time mentally

1mk5mm7,wish i looked “sicker”,"someone told me that my previous stay at the psych ward might have just been a sporadic episode and questioned why i was even there because i seem to have “moved on” and am “doing so much better”. guess it’s because i go to school and don’t take meds! what they don’t see is me forcibly going off every single one of the meds i was taking and masking so hard every single day just to show none of the intense emotions i feel so that people don’t get driven away. also i literally can’t be hospitalised again because my course is in the healthcare sector and in a small country everyone knows everyone in the sector. i am not running the risk of bumping into my classmates or profs AS A PATIENT because none of them know about this part of me!!!!!

it’s so fucking invalidating because i deal with this shit every waking moment and nobody appreciates how hard it is. and continue to dismiss my pain. it triggered an instant split lol i could feel the dissociation and shift in perception immediately. all i wanted to do was get out of there. never told them anything about BPD because i had no more energy left and it won’t matter anyway since they’ll just say “you don’t look like it, it’s probably not that”.

1mjfuxx,Anybody else engage in risky behavior when they're bored or just feel too painfully empty,"I've noticed that whenever I get bored or I feel uncomfortably empty. I start making VERY bad decisions. It's like I need to be entertained. I need some thrill. I've literally jumped into relationships. Simply because.. I WAS BORED OR I FELT I NEEDED SOME THRILL. I've literally kept shitty people around.

Just so I can have some thrill and when I don't have anything thrilling to do.. I become so empty inside and depressed and just uncomfortable with existing and I can never just do something simple or basic. I just know if I had money. I'd blow right through it. All the times I've had money. I spent it all. I've binge ate even though I wasn't even really hungry. Just because I was PAINFULLY BORED/EMPTY.

I will engage in sexual acts. Just because I need the thrill. Not because I genuinely enjoy it.

1mk4d12,New diagnosis,"I was just diagnosed two weeks ago and really really struggling with this diagnosis. I keep seeing posts about how people with BPD are abusers and I truly don’t resonate with that at all and it’s making me feel like a horrible branded monster. Yes I have my blow ups every now and then but they’re normally in private and hardly ever directed at anybody else. My poor parents have received the brunt of it particularly my dad, that relationship is a little more complicated than my relationship with my mum as there is a lot of trauma there. But overall me and my dad are better than ever which I am very grateful that we’ve been able to come this far. 
From what I’ve researched I think my BPD falls under quiet BPD as most of negative behaviour is directed towards myself. My self hatred is insane at the moment and the diagnosis has just sent that skyrocketing. My attachment issues are better than they were but still not great.
I’m 29f and I’ve never managed to have a serious long term relationship. I’ve had many a situationship but I find it so unbearable dealing with the ambiguity of dating I either pick the wrong people or self sabotage. I would love to have a partner and to be settled in that space but since this diagnosis that feels like it’s getting further and further from the realms of possibility. I feel very much like a horrible freak who nobody wants to deal with and it’s too much and too complicated, which sucks because I know when I’m balanced I’m a pretty decent person to be around and I have so much love to give. I just worry that subjecting someone else to these insane lows isn’t fair and will I be alone forever? 
I am in therapy and have been for almost 4 years so I’m hoping with this new direction of DBT and the backup of meds I’ll be able to get to a better place. 
I just needed to get this off my chest as I believe I’m the only person I know with this disorder so trying to convey my emotions to people who don’t have this, can sometimes be exhausting and frustrating.  
I’m on week two of medication and just doubled my dose and touch wood, today is a good day. Fingers crossed for the future 🤞🏻

I feel like everything is gone when Im panicking i feel an overwhelming sense of nihilism, derealization and disconnect which creates this ""Solipsistic loneliness"" feeling for me.

 The way I think my experience differs from others is definitely the mental pain. it literally feels like my soul is burning, a little unhinged but that's the truth. That pain is so great It creates the urge to just overdose not because I want to die, I want to stop this.

""what do you enjoy doing?"" ""what's your favorite food?""  Because I don't even know.  I'll just sit there, thinking...  and then I realize how truly sad that is.  That I have no consistent perceptions of myself.

Any hobbies, friends, moments all feel completely pointless and fleeting.  I know that I'll just be too messed up to maintain something that consistent and I know that any moments, good or bad, are all eventually bad under my later perception.  It's like I'm walking through life completely aware of how little connection to myself I feel, but I'm incapable of doing anything.  And whether or not I'm right, I just always feel so disregarded, so meaningless, so trivialized.  That only feeds into my disconnection.  I'm just trying to get through life, but no matter how disconnected I feel from reality and myself, I can't possibly escape the debilitating feelings that drive my dissociation in the first place.  

I just want to feel something; I just want an escape.  If something triggers something inside of me, I will intentionally do something I know will make me miserable just to have a tiny escape.  Or maybe I'll just spiral deeper into a pit for months.  I can't even text people regularly because I just feel like my connection with them is fake and that they hate me.

1mk03ai,i feel like im being punished by having bpd,"



Hi, I'm writing again in this subreddit because last time it really helped me a lot.
Basically, I really want to know: does it ever get better?

I have BPD and bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed at 18; I'm 20 now and I still feel the same—helpless, sad, empty, absolutely numb most of the time. (Unless I’m having an episode. When I have those, I feel every emotion under the sun, and it gets so bad that I often get so sick I can't eat, drink, or do anything for days. I just lay there in a catatonic state.)

I have some hope that it will get better—maybe, I don't know. I've been through absolute hell most of my life. Now, I’m in a healthy relationship with my amazing boyfriend. Everything is going well: I got into two universities I always wanted, I'm away from my abusive, disgusting, and toxic mom, I have my own place, and I recently rescued and adopted a cat.
Everything is going amazing—everything is amazing—and I know I probably sound selfish and disgusting for saying this, but I don’t feel any of it.
I feel overwhelmed and numb—the same feeling I’ve had since I was 12. I can't enjoy things. I can't do anything, just because I have BPD.
I feel like I’m being punished for the rest of my sad existence. I feel like I’m just a sad person. Everything I do—just the feeling around me—is sad.
Everything I do feels like a punishment, and I don’t know what to do, because I’m literally holding on to crumbs of hope.

I really need to know—will I ever get better?
I just want to feel normal again. I want to feel love. I want to feel happiness—just anything that isn’t this same disgusting feeling.

Also, for anyone wondering: I am in therapy. I’ve been in therapy since I was 15. I’m off my meds because they messed up my life, my body—everything—so badly. I’ve been clean from them for over a year now, maybe a little more.
I still have really bad sh behavior, and often I can't control myself or trust myself not to sh again. (I’ve been clean for a few days :’c )",1754573248.0,1,1,BPD,bpd
1mjtk9w,I have a favorite person who is not my boyfriend… What can I do to stop this?,"
I’m 18F diagnosed with BPD last year with other mental illnesses that I feel are irrelevant to share.

Hi, This has been going on for quite a while… Sorry if this post is just me rambling.

There was this one girl in the school I graduated from which I’ve always been obsessed about to the point of me stalking her soical media accounts every single day (this has been going on since mid 2024). I know almost everything about her due to my obsession and attachment towards her.
I think about her a lot during the day, but I really just want this to be over. It’s so tiring and makes me feel like an absolute freak for doing this for this long.
I know this is wrong and unhealthy but I just can’t stop, she has became a part of my life without even knowing it
(Funny thing is that we were friends for like two months, hanged outside of school once and that was it)

What really is making me go insane is the fact that I have a boyfriend, we’ve been dating for almost half a year and I love him more than anything, he is very kind and understanding and has been doing everything in his power to learn how to deal with my bpd, he is all I have left… but she is still haunting my mind. No matter if I try to not check her socials I STILL wonder if she’s okay or what she’s up to… And yes I tried blocking her, didn’t work :(

I vaguely told him about this so he doesn’t know the full extent of this, and I am scared of what will happen when I will eventually have to come foward to him about this. It feels so wrong and the guilt is eating me.

What can I do to stop this? Or at least how can I manage it? All help is appreciated… ",1754551562.0,3,3,BPD,bpd
1mjzxja,im trying to remember the name of this certain DBT skill,"hi!!

so a few years ago i did IOP for 6 months to treat my BPD, and we did a lot of DBT practice. i had a journal where i kept everything that i learned: all my skills, impactful words from my counselors or fellow group members, and general thoughts. recently i misplaced that journal, so i lost all of that. :( ive been working to gather up everything i can remember, and there's this one skill that has been on the tip of my tongue for a while. im pretty sure my therapist referred to it as ""split self,"" but whenever i google it i just get results about splitting, which is not what im trying to find. basically what this skill did was help you compartmentalize different emotions and identify where certain feelings come from and how they can all come together as a whole. for example, i had my ""child self"" that was the traumatized and scared part of myself, and the ""angry self"" that would lash out and isolate from the world. then there was the ""hopeful self"" that wanted to get better. i liked this skill because i could put names to how i was feeling and treat them all as separate parts, that way i could tackle them one by one. something my bpd has made difficult for me is being unsure of who i am and what my personality is (hence the PD part of BPD lol), and this skill helped with that. basically im just wondering if anyone else ever learned this skill in DBT??

1mjzcgw,Advice for coping with severe depression?,"Hi so I 24m recieved my eupd diagnosis from the NHS(England) when I was 21.
I've had severe depression for as long as I can remember and I've been on many medications
-Citalopram(Cipramil)
-Fluoxetine(Prozac)
-Mirtazepime(Remeron)
I refused Sertraline(Zoloft) because I knew i was going on HRT (Testosterone) and didn't want anything to affect my heart health
I'm currently on Venlafaxine (Effexor) 300mg daily and while it's been amazing at stabilising my moods and pretty much stopping any self harming thoughts and suicide ideation I'm still really struggling with the severe depression.
 
The doctors tried me on Amitriptyline(Elavil) along side my venlafaxine but I really didn't like how drowsy it made me and I would miss taking my morning meds because I slept in till the evening and it completely messed up any routine I had. 
I also have chronic pain and fatigue which makes the depression worse. 

All I do is sleep, wake up to eat but sometimes I can't even bring myself to so i just go back to sleep. I leave the house maybe 2 times a week to see a friend and walk the family dog.
Something that might be important is im not diagnosed, but im like 99% sure and have been for the last 5 years that I am autistic or have ADHD or both. 
im just so sick of living like this I'm not a person anymore. I miss my hobbies. I miss feeling like im capable of anything. 

im going to make a doctors appointment tomorrow and try and get a referral for therapy and hopefully discuss additional medications.

Does anyone have any advice on just like little things i can do to get through the day, anything specific I should say to a doctor or literally just any advice at all? I just need something to change

I meet someone, and at first it’s perfect. They’re everything, and I fall hard. I cling. I give too much, too fast. I say things I mean in the moment, but that come off as overwhelming or intense.

Then the fear creeps in — fear they’ll leave, that they’re lying, that I’m too much. I start pulling back or testing them: “Would they still stay if I acted like this?” I sabotage. I ghost. I explode. And in the end, I always end up alone, confirming the very fear that drove me to destroy it.

I hate the way my emotions hijack me. One small shift in someone’s tone, one unanswered message, and suddenly I’m spiraling. Either I think they hate me or I hate them. There’s no middle ground.

I’m in therapy and trying DBT skills, but sometimes the shame feels like a second skin. I see all the wreckage I’ve left behind and wonder if I’ll ever be capable of loving without hurting people.

1mjraij,"Trying Not to SH, Any Tips?","Trigger Warning- self harm, domestic violence (?)

hi guys, long time no post. i’ve been doing good the past few years, just having a rough night that i’m hoping doesn’t turn into more. 

i’ve been clean from self harming since i was 18, and im currently 21 and close to reaching my 22nd birthday. i had to break up with my boyfriend today, we’ve been on and off for almost 5 years but consistent and living together the past 1+ year. unfortunately my episodes have been getting worse when i drink, and my boyfriend and i got into an argument the other night that led to me breaking my tv, his tv, and our bedroom closet door. i couldn’t control myself and it ultimately led to him putting his hands on me, not hitting me, but just grabbing me pretty roughly that left bruises across my arms and a bruise on my eye and cheek from bouncing off the bed and accidentally hitting a dresser. i know he was just trying to get me to calm down and he’s a really great man who would never intentionally hurt me, but the bruises just worry me too deeply. 

self harm was something i used to calm myself down and quiet my thoughts and brain, so i think that part of me is missing it. since i no longer hurt my own body on the outside, i think i’ve resorted to just drinking a lot more to suppress my emotions. but i stopped for a long time and it wasn’t even something that crossed my mind during the hard situations, but now while i’m home alone and i wait for my friends to text me back i just can’t help but crave it in a way. i don’t want to hurt and feel this storm inside and i know it would be so easy to just calm myself down that way, but i also know that’s not right.

i suppose im writing this post to keep myself busy in a way, pushing off the next drink i have set up for myself. most of the time i know im good and just a human trying their hardest but right now i can’t help but hate myself. i feel like i have nothing and i am nothing and it sucks because i worked so hard to escape this. i feel like i’m falling back into that hole and i don’t feel like it would matter if i asked anyone for help. i don’t feel like i deserve it anyways.

1mjoz1d,dangerous situation & I feel like my BPD is to blame,"I was in a really tough spot. I got kicked out of my sober living due to relapse and had nowhere to go. My friend, Zach offered me a place to stay. Apparently Zach was staying with another guy named Steve whom he was renting under. 

Apparently, Steve immediately became infatuated with me and kept asking Zach about me, Zach, and his girlfriend having a three way which obviously pissed off Zach’s girlfriend.

Anyway, Zach and his girlfriend went to work which meant that me and Steve were home alone. Steve was pestering me all day, asking if I wanted to move to the mountains with him, about my ex boyfriend, promising me to give me the world, that he’d treat me right, if I wanted to date him, what I was looking for at the time, asking “why do I feel nervous around you?” all damn day. I had no other place to go so I put up with it. I had known him for 12 hours and he was proclaiming his love for me, trying to lay his head on my lap. I kept moving away from him. He kept asking to hold hands. I’m conflict-avoidant and just said I was too warm for that. I know, stupid.

I finally got fed up of dealing with him and managed to find a hotel room to stay in for a few days. He got my number and kept texting me on that and I got irritated and blocked him.

Flash forward five days later and I get a phone call from him on a fake number. Immediately I hang up, he texts me again, saying “all I did was look out for you” and “why I was acting that way”.

I got so fucking fed up and tired of trying to be nice that I told him, “do you want me to be honest? I am NOT attracted to you nor have I ever been. Please stop texting me and leave me alone”. He responded “whatever” and “that’s the last time I’ll help someone again” blah blah blah.

Zach calls me a few days later and alleges that Steve sent him texts pretending to be me and texting about a three way yet again. He sent a pussy pic of a woman who was at LEAST three shades lighter than me. Zach knew it wasn’t me. Getting angry I texted Steve again and told him to “get a fucking life”.

The next night I get a text from another random number asking about some dude named “country”. I guess it was a nickname. I ask Zach if he knew who he was and he apparently is connected to a sex trafficking ring and Steve is associated with him. 

Steve sent the trafficker photos of me from Facebook, my name, which city we were in, etc. It’s a small town and I have very, very distinct features. Zach tells me that they will now be looking for me and that it is no longer safe for me to be there and that I need to leave it as soon as possible.


I got terrified, moved cities, and am in a safe place. I’m upset to know someone who knows someone who KNOWS someone who’s connected with something that dangerous.

I feel stupid and truly do not ever want to deal with this shit ever again. I feel like it’s my damn fault because had I not gotten kicked out of my sober living for drinking due to being reckless because of my BPD, NONE OF THIS FUCKING SHIT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

1mjwe1h,"Please help my girlfriend, I need opinions from people with bpd or good knowledge of it immediately!","To start off, I’ve been dating my gf for almost 2 years now. 

I’ll start of with her childhood just to give you all a little more understanding of who she is. She used to get abused by her mother, awfully. She was constantly threatened with knives growing up, her school life? As worse, she got sexually assaulted on multiple occasions and nobody did anything. She was beaten up everywhere she went.

Her parents don’t believe in the dumb mental health disorder crap. So she can’t get help. They won’t let her, afraid it would affect her future. 

She loves animals, she advocated for animal abuse, she’s a voice for those who don’t have one. She would never lay hands on an animal, ever, that’s who she is, a gentle loving soul. She loves the colour yellow, she loves to do tumbling, she’s an elite cheerleader. She enjoys collecting toys, she loves colour, she’s full of soul. 

But there are numerous times where I somehow trigger her, and she completely changes, I can’t even recognise her when she does switch. I did some research on this, and apparently it’s bpd splitting. One moment, she’ll love me and kiss me and everything, but the next, she’ll tell me to kill myself, she’ll threaten to hurt herself, she’ll tell me I’m the worse person she’s ever met. What triggers this? Everything, anything. I could be peeing for like 5 seconds and she’ll spam me and tell me that she hates me because I didn’t let her know etc. She just becomes unrecognisable. After these episodes, she seems ashamed of them, she wonr talk about them, she’ll act like everything is fine, as if I’m the only thing that matters in this world. A recent fight was today, she couldn’t join the call, and I told her to try and spam the button, she freaked out and said “don’t u think I’ve been trying, ur so stupid’ and started telling me to just die or else she’ll kill me herself.

I have already asked some people for help on this, people who deal with bpd people in rs, but they all tell me she’s a horrible person and every bpd person are unhelpable and I should just leave. But I need to hear your guys’ opinions on this. My girlfriend is an amazing soul, she needs help though, she really does. But we need to know why she’s like this first.

1mjqa1o,How to determine BPD from anxious attachment without BPD?,"The behaviors described in each overlaps each other, and I understand most pwBPD have anxious attachment styles. Though, I wonder what would differentiate a person with an anxious attachement having BPD or not?

I'm also pretty sure I have ADD so that comes with its own fair share of emotional dysregulation. Low self esteem and self worth from past experiences with loved ones, and a lot of trauma. Intense fear of abandonment to the point I may self-sabotage my relationships sometimes by being too distrusting or draining by asking for validation all the time. 

The overlapping symptoms confuse me and I have trouble trying to see if I have BPD. I can go to a psychiatrist, but my insurance is not available for that yet. I plan to, but in the moment, I just want a good measure of where I stand.

So my question is: What does BPD look like for you guys and how do you know it's not just anxious attachment (or a combination of ADD+anxious) without BPD?

My mind is always rushing. Im always anxious about something.

Currently i am solo travelling and trying to enjoy my single life. I made a promise after a broken engagement  that I would get myself helped and also not settle before doing things I would regret not doing.

9 months in and I've had a few travel flings + it all seemed ok.

 Then recently been having some FP attachments and severe depression.

I'm anxious about planning the rest of my trip out and making a decision so I can book flights and get the best prices. 

So Im trying to plan out the next 6 months in my head all at once whilst alos trying to decide what to do for the day.

Then i'm also considering the future and so I want to see everything I possibly can before I settle. I dont want marriage or a family or a relationship for a really long time.

But I DO also desperately want those things eventually before its too late.

I want my dream to be true at the same time as letting go of such a fairytale.

So my mind is racing trying to make sure I can fit everything in before I settle down but then if I keep going till turning 32 (nearly 26 now), im then anxious about being too old to start again.

Imagine that, at 32 having to move countries, find a stable job, a place to live, a community of friends, and then on top of that to try and find a healthy relationship whilst the clock is fucking ticking to have kids.

and idw kids unless im married so then I've gotta think about marriage. Marriage of course is a big decision, it takes years of a relationship and then a year easily to plan.

 Then you dont want kids straight away but oh by then I could easily be nearly 40 and idw to be 80 when my potential kids are 40.

I also left my religion the last few years but then in my mind I still doubt if this might just be a phase and how that might impact how I am as a partner and possible.parent.

Its like I need to know everything is going to be ok so I need to have it all perfectly planned out

See how my brain works? 

I absolutely despise the idea of a relationship right now but I really desperately want one eventually. 

I want to marry but not for at least 8-15 years. But then that might be getting too old.

All these fucking things and my mind wont stop worrying and contradicting itself.

Fuck this. 

Does anyone else have this need to be everything to everyone and do everything you want in life and need to plan it out so you can make sure ir happens and all fits in together?

1mjslbx,my experience with lamictal,"i was prescribed 25mg of lamictal/lamotrigine, then 50mg, then 75mg, and finally 100mg. i have been on it since september of last year. prior to this, i had intense splitting episodes where everything felt like a trigger. upon spiraling, i would experience self-harm urges, prolonged screaming out of rage, and high emotional instability.

with the lower doses, the changes included less of a triggered reaction to situations that would have originally sent me spiraling. it’s not that i didn’t care, but the feeling was not as intense anymore whereas it used to make my chest ache. i occasionally still split, but it made me more aware of my actions—everything just felt a bit muted whereas my BPD originally made me feel like every single emotion was raw and powerful. 

the higher doses (50mg+) got prescribed after i explained what i mentioned in the previous paragraph. ever since then, my splitting has truly changed in frequency. when it does finally hit every once in a while when i get triggered, it hits hard, but the buildup to get to that point is so incredibly long and slow that it’s so easy for me to pull myself back before i can reach the peak of my emotions. i genuinely do feel more at peace, but this medication is alongside conscious efforts to heal and a lot of self-reflection, so my experience definitely was positively affected by that. overall, my triggers still exist, but my BPD as a whole has toned down. my only concern is not being able to live and/or heal completely without the medication, and i honestly don’t think i can at this time. this post was just meant to be a shared experience so i hope it was interesting",1754547918.0,1,0,BPD,bpd

1mjsfb7,Could I still have BPD?,"So this is my first post and all and I’m quite new to Reddit but I was wondering some in-site on this matter. From what I can recall, my childhood had nothing wrong and I can’t remember me having an actual reason of having BPD, yet within the last month of me researching all of the information I could on it, it makes sense for me to have it. I most likely have Discouraged BPD, which is internal anger, and I’m undiagnosed (I think I have a lot more stuff but not the point). I do remember as a child my feelings were invalidated a lot, mainly at school… and sorta even now I’m still trying to understand everything. My parents aren’t exactly abusive… they just yell when I don’t do something or just forget to do it, just as anyone else would do. I think around 5-7 years ago I started to panic a lot and started to be more attached to people. I never knew how to make friends or boundaries or what not, so obviously things end up going wrong and nothing ends up working out. For me, the signs started showing in middle school. I do end up getting worried a bunch whenever someone I care for leaves and I’ve just gotten so used to it that sometimes I don’t even care and I stop trying to be friends with people. I don’t know why but sometimes I can be fine and other times I can be sad, not because of depression or anything, but mainly because other people cause that and I feel like without a proper diagnosis it’s pointless to try to explain my situation. If I do have it, I do wish I get treatment for it. I can’t because obviously I need prove I would have it so someone could take me but that’s not happening till I’m able to give proper evidence. On the surface I am completely fine, sometimes I do get upset and it’s normally around people leaving me or giving signs of that. I’ve probably lost a lot of friends because I couldn’t improve my qualities that were holding me back because they were BPD related. The world’s just hard when no one believes you, that there could be something seriously wrong but just because you aren’t physically abused or just probably abused in general, there’s nothing wrong. Also in relation to parents they do know I am sensitive to stuff but they don’t really do much about it just saying it’s for my growth and all but I don’t exactly know if you could just call that abuse (learning how to drive, getting a job). It also just feels like sometimes I have no control over my feelings, like let’s say for example you’ve liked this girl a lot and you want to be with her for the rest of their life. You two even promised to date each other again later. All of that only for you to find out later that she started dating her ex again and the two loved each other… she forgot that promise of you two getting back together too. You start crying and you get upset over it, only to be fine like a few hours later to never worry about it again. That’s basically me in a nutshell. I can only get upset over stuff for so long, no matter how bad it is, before I just swap back to being happy or something else. I also have a much smaller field of emotions… and anger isn’t there at all. You’ll never see me get angry and that’s also somewhat frustrating because I feel lost and I want someone to guide me and be with me forever but I have all of these issues no one sees but me. If anyone has any thoughts on this then you can go ahead and say it. Love to hear some opinions because I’ve been pondering on this for a while and I’m really relating to stuff mentioning BPD let alone quiet BPD and I find it interesting I don’t exactly know why but this may be the feeling I felt I knew was off about me ever since I’ve started acting off.

I have BPD and have a past of overdoing and over complicating relationships. I read into EVERYTHING, and have a rly hard time controlling my emotions and often times feel out of control. I have gotten therapy and was put on meds for YEARS and still attempted twice. But the past 9 months I have been the best I have ever been. Not only am I no longer on my anti-psychotics, but i rekindled some past relationships from high school and have never been happier. In the past, I have burned every bridge and even tho I wasn’t in the wrong on why most of them ended, that doesn’t mean that I didn’t in some way push them to that point. I rly try to be a good person and change and make sure the ppl I care about never have to be dragged down with me in my spiral again. But the past two weeks so much has changed in my life and I have felt like I’ve been losing control again.
There is so many things shifting and changing but I refused to acknowledge them which is why I think I ended up hurting the ppl I love the way I used to when I was unstable. 
One of the friends I reconnected with was one of my guy friends from high school/ college. Let’s call him Edward. The other one was a girl I’ve known since elementary school. Let’s call her Kinsey. 
I started hanging/ going out with kinsey and it has been sooooo much fun! But whenever we hang out she gets hit on a LOTTT. She is the prettiest person I have ever met inside and out and I usually am not one to compare myself to others. But there is almost no flaws or faults in her and I think it started to make me more and more insecure the more I realized how different people approached/ spoke to us. She had never ONCE done anything or said anything other than complete positivity to me. I hate to admit it but one night after she went home and it was just Edward and I, I ended up saying something mean about how “she’s not even that pretty” or something of that nature. I can’t express enough how perfect this girl is, how perfectly kind and thoughtful she is. So having said this was so obviously out of line and completely out of my own insecurities and I regret it deeply. But Edward is also a friend of hers and about a week later he ended up going off on me about how I have been treating him and what I said about her. I think that it isn’t one specific thing that finally put him over the edge but it was little things that started chipping away. I am needing to work on myself again and completely rethink my betterment as a person. But my question is, is it too late? I live in a small town and I don’t think there are many people left for me to be friends with that I haven’t in some way been associated with in a negative way. I fuck up a LOT. I have put in so much effort into changing but I can’t lie, if the two best people I’ve ever been friends with can’t deal with me… then maybe there’s no one left for me anywhere… 
Please help. I wanna move away but I can’t. I wanna be better and I will try. But I am giving space and time but there is no one left for me to turn to. I think I’m beyond repair. I think this world isn’t for me. I’m slipping again. I would have attempted again if it weren’t for my fear of what happens after I die…

1mjlx0d,"I wish people would stop trying to ""help""","I hate being upset and having people try to ""help."" Just tonight, I got upset because my partner decided to stay at their parents house instead of at mine, but I was able to calm myself down because I recognized that it wasn't that big of a deal I was just having big feelings. And I texted them that, basically telling them that I just needed some space but that I was going to be okay. I texted them that before driving home from work and was home 10-15 minutes before they called me asking if ""everything was okay."" And then they offered to come back! And I had to decline, but I was already getting my hopes up that they would come home. They're packing up things to move at their parents and made it seem like maybe they'd put it off and come back, but eventually decided not to... which immediately triggered me again. And I got even more upset bc it feels like now they're just fucking with me, and I want to believe they aren't but it really feels like they are. Before I hung up I told them that I wish they had just left well enough alone, and they said they were ""just trying to help,"" but this isn't helpful! Now my night is basically double-ruined. I didn't ask for help, specifically because I know this is how it goes in situations like these. I don't know why people always insist on trying to ""help"" when they don't even understand what the fuck is going on. I don't  want to be angry with my partner over this (and please don't demonize them in the comments based off of the way I describe them when I'm angry) but it's so frustrating.

1mjqih9,How the hell do I get over a breakup??? How do I go about forgiving myself?,"It’s been 4 months. I still think about him constantly. It’s 100% my fault he broke up with me, I would have done the same if I was him.

I often have swings between being convinced I’m going to win him back, and then hating him. But I’m constantly in a state of guilt, and it’s only been getting worse. I’ve pulled away from everyone- leaving only surface level relationships. I’ve never been the bad guy before. I mean sure I’ve messed up but I’ve been forgiven- this lasting disdain for me, is new. I don’t know how to deal with it.

1mishqf,Does anyone else cope by being overly logical?,"I have always been someone who was seen as “smart” in school and then “academic” as an adult despite not going to an impressive college or getting degrees beyond my bachelors. At work and with friends, I am one of the least touchy-feely people and I find “inspirational” speeches cheesy and sometimes manipulative. At times I wonder if this is a coping mechanism for BPD? Like, I need to counterbalance my strong emotions by also being overly logical and wise and backing up everything I say lest I seem dramatic (I still come off as dramatic so it doesn’t even work!) I almost feel like I have a huge metaphorical wall up that makes me unable to truly express emotions at this point. I wasn’t always this emotionally guarded (even though I still cry easily), but it’s only gotten worse as time has gone on. 

Does anyone else experience this or is it likely a different part of my personality?

Tagging this as seeking support/advice because I could really use it. I want to feel comfortable being vulnerable with people, but it feels like whenever I do I go way overboard! There is no balance, I’m either cold and emotionless or a dramatic spiraling baby and even those moments don’t feel cathartic or like true vulnerability.",1754446362.0,121,30,BPD,bpd

But after only usually 2 hours (and a break) it gets more and more unbearable.

It feels like my head is constantly telling me „get up. get up. get away“
My body starts to physically feel the unease, I don’t know how to describe it, it’s just tense and hurts a bit. I feel like screaming.
I don’t feel concentrated anymore.
I have to force myself to write every single word, read every sentence.

Then my thoughts usually start to spiral.
„Don’t make such a big deal out of this. You’re just lazy and undisciplined. Everybody else can do it, why can’t you?“
I start to think about how and why I feel the way I do. I wonder how others are feeling. I wonder if I’ll ever be doing alright. 
Then I’ll feel like crying. Sometimes I do.

I feel so guilty. I never feel proud of myself. I feel like I’m doing something wrong.
I’m not in therapy anymore (my therapist said she helped me as much as she could, been there for about 3 years)
I feel like I could only study in peace if i followed through keeping up properly during the semester, but I didn’t manage to do that this time.

1mjpoyf,retroactive jealousy,"for context, i got diagnosed with bdp a few months ago and it has really opened my eyes to things i was experiencing but couldn’t explain. one of those things being the insanely intense retroactive jealousy i feel at the mention of my partner’s past. it nearly destroyed our relationship in the beginning. his ex right before me is gorgeous, and it took me months to get to a point where i didnt feel nauseous even thinking about her. my best friend said with time this feeling would lessen and she was right for the most part. i don’t have breakdowns even close to as much before and don’t ask for as much reassurance. 
yet there are times where i cannot seem to shake it off and just move on when his past is brought up suddenly. i feel paralyzed, like my anxiety is taking over all my senses and i immediately start shutting down. it is something about knowing that he has been intimate with other people and had to reach a deep enough emotional connection to get to that place that makes my heart drop. i am scared that i may be seen as just a number or that nothing that’s happened between us is new or as good. i know it’s very irrational and yet i still get extremely upset over it. i know it’s not his fault and having a past is normal and i wish i could respond to this better. there’s no better way to explain it than just it eating me alive.

1mjhdpp,How to get over a break up when the emotions feel like they’ll end you?,"Last week my boyfriend ended our two year relationship. It was not a perfect relationship by any means and it definitely took a hard emotional toll on us as we constantly hurt each other unintentionally. 
He ended our relationship while I was going through a really hard time and having a lot of emotional break downs and anxiety attacks within the span of a couple of days. I just needed him there for me and he said he wasn’t able to be there for me in the ways I needed. I needed a hug, I just needed to talk to someone. 

I called him twice in one day a few days after the break up, sobbing and begging him to stay with me, which he declined and showed little to no emotion or empathy. 

I’ve been trying so hard to not think of things but it’s like I don’t even have the ability to not think about it. The emotions and pain have been consuming me and it feels physically painful with how strongly I’m hurt by this.

E: I know this is a me problem, which is why im asking for advice. What doesnt help is he had a crush on me from before we started talking and during.

1mjh1b7,Attack on my identity,"This is my first ever post on reddit, I don't even know if I'm doing it right, but I just need to get this off my chest because I cannot sleep until I write it all out.
Today was a really hard day for me, although it all started out good. I emailed a guitar teacher a few days ago because I wanna take lessons and he called me back today to talk about the appointment etc. I really panicked because one of my biggest fears is phone calls, it just makes my social anxiety peak. And that was when he asked the question: what kind of music do I listen to. I knew that this would come up so I planned every answer days before (like I always do with every social interraction) but in that moment I suddenly just couldn't remember anything. It was really embarrassing (at least I felt like that) and after the call ended I started spiraling. Now, few hours later I understand why. For some reason, the fact that I couldn't remember something so surface level about myself felt like an attack on my identity which is already really unstable and things like this can completely shatter it. I ended up relapsing (self harm) which just made everything worse and now I feel like shit. This feels so embarrassing that I overreacted this hard about something so simple, the guy probably doesn't even remember it anymore.
Does anyone feel this intense when you don't remember something about yourself / others don't remember something about you? Because for me it's a really big part of my struggle.

1mjotms,Idk how to feel,"I was told this afternoon after I got off of work that my dad's kidneys are shit and the doctors are  going to try to limp his kidneys along as long as they can before he has to do dialysis. And I am so f**king mad at him for this. Letting this happen.

When I was little he had stage 4 colon cancer. He was so young when he got it that the doctors treated his cancer extremely aggressively. And he had alot of medical problems due to it. Which is one of the things I have PTSD from and what started my BPD. 

One of the side effects he got was bad damage to his kidneys. When I was 18 he was told to stop drinking dark soda. He never stopped, he would sneak cokes when my mom stopped buying it. She would buy him mt. Dew which was one of his favorites. (He also has diabetes and watched his grandma go blind and die from it).

About a year ago his gfr was 100. February it was 50. Last week it was 31. At 13 you have to go on dialysis if you want to still live.

And if this would have happened if he did what he was told and not always just have what he wanted, and this happened I wouldnt be mad. But he completely ignored the advice of about 6 different doctors thinking he knew better. 

And it makes me so angry because to me I feel that by doing that he was being selfish and not thinking of others, of us his family. That indulging in stuff he shouldn't he didn't care that it would make me go back to a head space that broke me. I am mad because he is going to make me watch him die again. But this time there isn't a treatment that could cure him.

His kidneys are f**ked, and if he goes on dialysis, I have seen this working in the medical field, he will have maybe 5-6 more years. Because he will give up and wallow in his self pity. And my mom is telling me that I cant be mad at him. That what happened is in the past. She compared this to when I was self harming and saying that she didn't get mad at me for self harming.

But once I got better in the way that I have not self harmed in over 7 years. I have not gone off my meds that help me. I have not continued to hang out with people who did that too. And even in moments when I really want to hurt myself i dont because I dont want my family to go through what I put them through again. I am just so mad.",1754535495.0,0,1,BPD,bpd

1m7kezf,"your brain is lying and your feelings are not facts, sorry","so i was spiraling again lol (shocking) and then randomly in the middle of crying on the floor i had this weird thought like
wait
what if i’m not my feelings ???
what if i’m just the poor fuck stuck DEALING with them like in an unpaid job

because for real every time i feel something be it abandoned, rejected, pissed off, hollow... it just becomes the whole fucking world. like suddenly i am that thing. no warning. just straight into a meltdown like it’s my job. acting from it. texting some dumb shit. immediately regretting everything. rinse. repeat.

but this time i just… noticed it??? like “oh. there’s that panic again. cute.”
and instead of exploding or trying to fix it or gaslighting myself into calmness, i just let it be there. i literally just sat with it like “yeah okay cry then, what else is new.” and weirdly… it passed. not easily. not quietly. but it fucking passed.

and i was like
OH
so i don’t have to believe every brain lie i think??
i don’t have to follow every dumbass emotion into the fire??
i can just… let the chaos scream in the background while i stare at the wall and disassociate in peace????

also. my brain loves to fucking time travel. constantly dragging me back to shit from 8 months ago or making up fake worst case scenarios. and meanwhile i’m just… here. sitting on my floor. no one’s yelling. no one’s dying. nothing is actually happening except my brain throwing a tantrum because it’s bored and dramatic.

turns out there’s a difference between “i’m in danger” and “i’m just fucking uncomfortable and my nervous system needs to chill.”
one means run.
the other means go drink some water and mind your damn business.
