doqwow,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1572360722.0,2365,177,depression,depression
1jys8x9,"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1744611968.0,47,123,depression,depression

1mq504p,when you're too tired to even want good things anymore,"lately it’s like my brain just doesn’t care anymore. i used to at least want things at work like taking on a cool project, getting a promotion, learning a new skill. now even those feel like chores in my head. my manager will ask what I’m excited about and I literally can’t think of anything.

it’s not even that i hate my job. it’s more like this constant low gray hum. wake up, log in, answer emails, sit in meetings, log out. eat the same quick lunches at my desk. avoid work chats because “i’ll reply later” but later never comes. i keep telling myself maybe I just need a vacation, but even when I’ve taken time off, it’s the same when I get back. it’s like the part of me that used to want to grow or try new things at work just shut down.

1mq4aoz,Things I noticed after I'm depressed-free,"Note. I'm from an Asian country, so there may be some cultural differences to most of you reading this.

I'm finally depressed-free after almost 10 years being depressed since 10. My depression was caused by my extremely strict mom, you probably can imagine a stereotypical Asian mom. She's like that but she's also a narc. She wants her kids to excel, but not too much because she thinks her kids are regular kids and we're not able to achieve great things. She hid my sibling's acceptance from prestigious middle schools because she wanted them to go to the same middle school as I did ( Which she also forced me to go to only because it's near our house and she can play a good mom by driving us there)

When I got in my dream high school which was the best high school in the country. (There were at least 10k applicants each year but they would only accept 1400 students a year. Each department has different acceptance numbers, I got in as a top 10 student in my department), she was against me going there because she never thought I would get in, let alone being accepted into the school's special academic program as well. She was very keen in suggesting I drop out and switch to a nearby school because it's closer to home.

She was a huge reason why all her kids turned out, although extremely academically great, were all suicidal with severe depression with poor social skills and have issues with friends.

Fast forward to now, I'm in Uni but I live in a dorm, an almost 2 hour drive away from home. It was a top Uni so she couldn't do much but she played good mom and let me 'live by myself'.

It took me almost 3 years to finally function, after getting bullied for years at school and cancelled in Uni for not fitting in to finally realised how to fit in socially and read social cues. 

When I was depressed, I had to take pills. Eating felt like a chore. Doing anything felt like a chore. Living was hard. I was so depressed and toxic, I lost a lot of good people in life who couldn't endure me repeating the same dark thoughts and memories. You guys probably know.


But now, only a few months after being depressed-free, my life turned a 180°. I have the energy to do everything. I don't just put aside the chores for a tomorrow, I do them right away. I went from an introvert, being someone who doesn't know what to say, having no topics to speak and just being a wall flower, to a someone who could talk for hours on different topics and still focus on multi-tasking.

My schedual is packed but I'm not tired. I'm energized and I felt like I lost my childhood to being depressed. If I wasn't, I had a huge potential to do greater things already. So I felt like, with onyl a few more months left of college, I want to do everything I can from the things I missed out from being depressed.

I no long feel anxious. I don't think too much. When people offend me, mostly my mom. I forget about it in a few hours and move on. And I'm not afraid to tell them about what I find offensive to and try to find a middle ground. But to those who are just too egotistic, I just leave them. (Unfortunetly, I can't leave my mom, I'm still financially dependant on her. Not really her but my dad but he listens to my mom so I have to play a good daughter until I'm financially stable enough to move out) 


But life has been so much better. It's like I'm Ariel, wanting to explore and do many things. Now I loothe depression. It took away so many things from me. And when I'm a teen too. That and covid? Took away my entire childhood and teenage life. 

I'm lucky that I'm in my early 20s and I still have a bit of time left. 

I had a few misfortunes this past weeks, almost a few accidents but I still managed to be positive. All this from being depressed-free. And I'm not bipolar too. I had Bipolar type 2 before so I knew what being extremely happy with Bipolar is like. I couldn't cry or feel sad at all when I had Bipolar. Now's the opposite.


To those who are wondering what will happen after being depressed-free or could no longer remember a life without depression. I was the your shoes a few months ago. I feel you and I want to be here for you to know that you can get rid of your depression too. Might be a long ride like mine. Might be shorter. But just hang in there. 

If you need advice or how I overcame mine, feel free to ask. ",1755186286.0,39,17,depression,depression

jobs and companies have unrealistic standards, and everything is so f#cking expensive.. some governments have gone to sh##

my life is tragic, i've endured severe childhood trauma, my parents got divorced long ago, i've kept going back and forth between countries because of how fucked up my family is and because of that i was never really able to finish my education.. father stopped spending on us long ago, i can't continue my education because of my financial situation.. my brothers are life savers since they're the ones who started spending on us.. now i live in south africa. i live in an old building without any soundproof. my neighbors engage in witchcraft and they're all females, they dropped out of school so they use their time by casting spells on neighbors, they're a bunch of lame retards who keep making loud noises and disturbance and nobody really punish them for that, i wanna finish my education but i can't bc of that. they're an absolute waste of space in every way. all of this information about them isn't made up and it's based on objective facts and observation, and what i've heard about them. i've tried all the solutions available (buying earplugs/earphones, finding somewhere else affordable to live, searching for a library [there are none where i live], reporting them to the building owner, finding just anywhere just to avoid these dumb lame ugly neighbors, etc. and they all failed). i live in constant disturbance every single day of my life in my own house and i can't sleep, there's really nothing i can do about it, dumb evil always wins in this reality. so there is no other solution than to migrate back to syria and live with my relatives, and even then i'll have huge issues which are very complex and i do not want to get into because i already made this rant long enough..

one thing i realized since i was a teenager is, the only ones (or the main ones, aside of natural disasters) making reality absolutely f#cking terrible for other human beings are stupid and evil people..

1mqnwqc,I'm in desperate need of help.,"So I'm 15 years old and officially had my first day of school today and it was a pretty bad experience due to the fact that I have major social anxiety. I did online school last year due to it but now i'm back into in person school this year and honestly I just want to die. Not just because of my social anxiety but also I'm just so unmotivated already since school has always been something that makes me even more depressed than I already am. I very rarely see a future for myself and it's always been that way so I don't see the point of going to school everyday just to work towards a future that isn't even guaranteed! I'm completely hopeless anyways because I have a learning disability which makes it really hard to understand things especially math so I'm nowhere close to the grade level I'm supposed to be at so even if I were to follow through with school there's no way I'd graduate.

I've thought about ending my life so many times but honestly the urge is stronger more than ever now due to the fact that high-school in person is just so much more stressful than elementary and middle school could've ever been for me. Despite the urge I don't think I could ever do it because I'm scared of it not working and embarrassing myself, I'm also scared for what would come next because nobody truly knows what happens after death, I'm also unsure due to the fact that I have a true passion for nature and dying would cause me not to be able to travel but it's not like I would've been able to anyways since traveling is very expensive and I probably wouldn't graduate due to my learning disability which means I wouldn't get a good paying job, and then I'd also say I'm a bit scared of how painful It'd be but at the same time pain is to be expected.

1mqn8ix,"I think at 18, I've reached the end of my life and everything it possibly could've been.","This is it. This is the end of my life; or rather a dream. I believe many people in my shoes would not have this conclusion, however they just don’t- and will never - understand. That if I can’t dream I cant live. That I’ve failed, over and over again. I was given so many chances to prove myself since Year 9, and I could never do it. It was handed to me on a silver platter yet I slipped and it fell on the floor, crushed, spoiled, staring back at me in utter disgust. Perhaps, it is not that others do not understand me, but I simply do not make sense. My mind is fractured in so many ways, and just when I felt like the system, others, had finally seen me, I was rejected once more. This is the end of my life. And I feel it. I can dream of a future, but I realise now that I never saw myself. That was not me. There is a version of me in my mind which I have come to confront is not real and never has been. I’ve become delusional, and I truly believed that I was not a dreamer but a doer. It was a lie. But what hurts the most is to see that my one passion outside of this deluded dream, my writing, literature, to be completely dismantled, destroyed, tossed away and regarded as a mess has completely broken my heart and I know I will never recover. I am fucking shit at English. English. English. English. I was delusional. To think the one thing I believed no one could take from me was never mine. It was a fantasy, that conveniently was encouraged for the past two years of my life, that I believed I was something outside of my mind. Others, in my position would grab the possible alternative degrees and move on. They’d be upset but they’d believe everything works out in the end. But I know myself more than anything. I cant bring up my SATS without shame. I was 11. I will never forgive myself for my GCSES. I will never forgive myself for English. For being handed it all, the dream so close to attainment. I could smell it. Taste it. Fuck I was so delusional I even allowed it to seep into reality in the form of hope. I cannot live with it. I will be, and am, miserable. It’s not even been 24 hours. In years? No. I cannot handle it. My heart has always been weak. So I will die before September arrives. Because all I ever was, was nothing. Everything I was, was a dream. And without my mind to fumble and curate fantasies, as I’ve been forced into a reality that clashes with everything I’ve ever dreamed of myself with, I am a bag of blood and organs. I’d rather make a sacrifice for a cause. That way, I will not dream again, and I will not be forced to live a lifetime of a nightmare. Perhaps I will be something, or perhaps I will, inevitably as I am, be nothing. This life was a life of nothing. I am sorry God, for the futility of such a beautifully horrifying creation of humanity. For living such a lifetime of delusion, that nothing on this earth could ever possibly glance at my writing, art, physical self, mental self, and feel anything but pure disgust. ",1755231415.0,2,1,depression,depression

1mqh1gk,I'm so fucked up,"I was on paroxetine 20mg for almost 6 weeks and stopped because I had a paradoxal effect which made me attempt suicide in may, I went to the psych ward for a day and lied to get out (but they probably needed the room for someone else anyway so even if they knew I was lying they let me leave). After this I was forced to go back to my parents place and I had regular check ups with nurses in a mental health facility, one month ago I've finally had another antidepressant (mirtazapine 30mg) but this Monday I had to skip a dose because I had to wait until Tuesday to get my new prescription. With this day off from mirtazapine I realized that I'm lack of appetite and general lack of desire for food came back, wich is a great thing because I went from BMI 17,7 to BMI 19,2 and it's taking a toll on me.

Now, it's Friday, 1 am here. And I feel so weird right now, all I've been thriving on this week was basically less than 1000 calories, because again, lack of interest towards food. I've even fasted for 24 hours and basically survived on a shit ton of cigarettes and coke zero, and beers, vodka and rum because I'm an alcoholic. (Also yes I count liquid cals)
And now what ? I haven't dropped magically weight (duh). I hate myself even more, my extreme mood swings are back at it, especially impulsively wise. But at first, it felt GREAT like I was off from it and I suddenly felt a glimpse of happiness? I thing that what it was, but while I was on mirtazapine I never felt anything remotely like this, it just.. lowered my suicidal thoughts.
But now I have those extreme mood swings like I had before, for a few years. 
And on top of that I start to feel watched again, like I was in 2022/2023. I haven't gotten proof that I was, like back then but I feel it and it's messing up with my brain and I know that's not rational imbut I can't help it it's always circling in my head
I wish I was normal, I wish my GP would listen to me when I tell her that I've been feeling socially weird all of my life, like I'm out of place, like I never got some sort of manual in life that everyone seems to get, do you understand?
I'm so so so tired. I want to be better but after trying and talking and taking the meds every day it didn't felt like it was really working on my mood.
And on top of that I have to take care of everything in my parents place while they're on vacation and while my aggressor is doing nothing, he gets to see his friends, he gets to be hammered every day, but apparently I can't have a beer ? Like make it make sense. I have to take care of fucking hamsters that belongs to him and there are 8 of them, because he got a female hamster who gave birth and now we have two separate cages but the thing is that the new cage is too big, they escape the cage and now I have to patch up the cage, try to find those fucking missing hamsters while I feel on the verge of a I don't know, psychotic episode? I don't fucking know.
I really don't want to start taking mirtazapine again. But I don't know what to do. My next appointment at the mental health facility is next Wednesday but I don't know if I'll be stable enough to even survive the next week. I feel like I'm not making sense and that's because nothing makes sense in my mind right now and this post is just a straight up chain of thoughts...
I wish I was normal, I wish I had friends and relationships yet everytime I self sabotage I ghost everyone, I cut myself, I take a ton of meds, I start to smoke again...

Then him fighting me for anything and everything along the path of separation. He tried to bankrupt me, almost succeeded. Now I have no retirement plan, I'm 58, I'll never be able to retire.

As the days go by I felt myself feeling more and more drained and I cried every night because I couldn't bare the feeling.but I still came to school with a smile cracking jokes knowing no one knew how I really felt.but later towards the end of the year I got into my 2nd relationship we went to prom together dances dates and everything I truly felt all those rough nights would come to and end and I would finally be able to emotionally recover and do better.


3 months in everything was going great I was truly happy and then as the days passed and once summer came we hit 5 months together and that's when everything changed.we started to barely speak and we only would if I texted first and I didn't feel right with that.So before summer ended I ended the relationship thinking I would a little better respecting myself and man oh man was I wrong.ive never mentally recovered from that  despite therapy and everything else and slowly everything changed my grades started to drop my friends moved and I was depressed and have been for a minute but yea idk what to do.",1755223614.0,1,0,depression,depression

Its weird because im always tired, but im not someone who can fall asleep during a movie/tv show like that. I always manage to get things done but I feel like I have to push myself much more than the average non-depressed person.

Ive tried supplements and nothing seems to work very well. Lately, my body feels tight and sore for no reason as well. I dont think im so old that my body should be feeling this way, as Im only in my 40s and healthy otherwise.

Can anyone relate to the low energy and body issues? What do you do about it? what made it better?

He was the life of the party. He could make strangers laugh in minutes. And he was the only person I could truly talk to. Now, the silence where his voice should be is unbearable.

Since he’s been gone, my family has unravelled. My mum tells me she doesn’t want to be here anymore, and I’m holding her together while trying not to fall apart myself. My little brother has just left school and is drifting, lost, without someone to guide him. I feel like I’m standing in the wreckage, trying to hold up the walls with my bare hands.

I’ll never speak to my dad again. He’ll never see the things I achieve. Even in the rare good moments, I still glance around for his reaction and then I remember.

Losing someone to suicide isn’t like losing them naturally. It’s a sudden drop into a world you don’t recognise. You’re left with questions that will never be answered, and a quiet, constant guilt that maybe you could have changed the ending.

The house feels emptier now. And some days, I’m not sure what the point of any of it is.

1mq3vxy,I’m struggling to see any reason to continue my life right now.,"
I didn’t perform well at my current university, and now I want to transfer to a much more challenging program. Given my mental and physical health, I’m not sure that’s realistic.

I experience severe self-esteem issues. Sometimes I feel completely worthless, ugly, and undeserving, other times I feel overly big or “too great“ for the world. My mood and self-perception swing between these extremes. I don’t have any friends or a support network to turn to, since I don’t want to burden my family too much. (They know about my issues though, but they’re also fed up, because these problems are ongoing) 

Physically, I have multiple serious health problems:
	•	I have multiple sclerosis (MS), which causes fatigue and other symptoms that completely drained me during last year’s exam period.
	•	I suffer from allergies that get especially bad in spring but affect me even now.
	•	Recently, I’ve developed new symptoms: swollen or sticky-feeling eyes in the morning, joint pain if I stay in one position for too long, neck pain and tension (especially in the morning) that cause dizziness and a feeling of pressure in my head and eyes.
	•	I haven’t had my period in a long time.

I’ve seen a neurologist and an eye doctor, and both recommended I get a thyroid test, which I will discuss with my GP tomorrow.

Emotionally, I feel dependent on the healthcare system just to survive. Without it, I believe I wouldn’t still be alive. I’m only 20, yet my body feels worn out and my health problems make it hard to imagine ever living a carefree, fulfilling life.

Sometimes I wonder if it would be better to just end things and find peace, instead of living with constant pain and exhaustion. I know that sounds irrational, but in those moments it feels real.

I grew up in a household dependent on welfare, abandoned by my father. I once believed that with enough effort I could break free from poverty and build a better life. Now it feels like I can’t keep up, and the weight of everything is just too much",1755185363.0,5,3,depression,depression

1mqfxuy,I don’t want to live but I’m too scared to die,"I (m) turned 18 a few days ago. I’ve struggled with depression for about 4 years and have had suicidal thoughts for about 3. I’ve had a few attempts with non getting close enough. When I was 16 I was 🍇Ed by an ex of mine whilst I was drunk and she made me do things I was clearly against and said no multiple times but wasn’t in a state where I could do anything. I’ve cheated once before a year and a half ago and I hated myself for it and tried to commit a few times, the only reason I’m still here is because  instead of a rope I used a skipping rope because that’s all I had and it couldn’t sustain my weight and snapped. I was also cheated on before than with my ex sending nudes and meeting up with my best friend at the time . This same ex was the ine that 🍇Ed me ended up getting with another one of my  best friends two Years later. I’ve been in three actual relationships I’ve gotten ataxthed to. The last one ending a few days ago. We had been talking for a year but actuslly dating for 8 months. I’ve always struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts after relationships. I’m not a great looking guy. Looks alone I’d say in maybe a 5-6 but I’m like 5,7 so there’s that. So each time I got into one of these relationships I thogougjt I was set for life and this was my last chance at someone to love me. I’m not a very popular guy and now especially the majority of people hate me. My ex got pregnant after the 🍇 but it’s more likley her old boyfriends because they were dating at the time and I had been told she had been hetting him to finish inside her for a while now. But they broke up and I rejected her after. So she’s been telling people that the baby is mine. So everyone thinks I’m a deadbeat dad who tried to escape his teenage pregnancy. Most people will probably be glad if I died and I’m scared to do it. But I can’t see any ither way out of it. I don’t want to go to uni because too many people thsg hate me will be there and make my life hell. My friends have all left me after the breakup because they were her friends first. I have one friend, and one person I talk to (one of me exes) but I vsnt be seen with her and nobody can know we talk because all her family hates me after the cheating which is deserved but it’s worth noting I was drunk which is not an excuse but just thought I’d note it down. I barely hang out and when I go outside it’s to the gym or going drinking by myself. My best friend  moved 2 and a half hours away from me so we barely see eachother. I just feel like I’m in the same spot I used to be. Alone and spending all day bed rotting. I’ve got nobody to talk to and i can feel mental state declining, I constsntly think about suicide more often than usual now and I even went to go to the cliffs to see if I could work up the coursge. I couldn’t even do thst tho because when I looked on snap maps my ex was at the beaches and if I went there and she saw me she’d think I was following her to stalk her. So I just sat by the pier drinking whiskey by myself. I want to die so badly but that’s only because it’s the only solution I can see. The thing I actuslly want rn is for everything to go perfect again. For everyone to like me and for them to know what actuslly happened to me, tk get back with me so I have someone to open up to and to sleep next to on a night. And for all my friends to come back o me so I can talk to people again and socialise. But thsg won’t happen. I am religious, Christian. And I have prayed for things to get better, when my first ex dumped me I asked to have her back so I can be haooy. He introduced me to someone, someone who made me feel haooy and was better than my ex. But I was so blind sighted from jt because I had this mentality in my head that all my problems statyes when she left me and if I got back with her again I’d be happy. And I ended up really hurting that poor girl because of that. Now I don’t deserve another chance from god. As much as I wish I had one I don’t. And I won’t ask. It worries me if I tske my life I’ll end up in the bad place because it is a sin to commit, and it’s my fault I’m like this. I was put here in this situation through my own actions. I just want to work up the coursge to actuslly be able to do it. Or alternatively have my life improve.

What medication changed your life for your crippling anxiety?

It getting to the point that it’s effecting me socially, I can barely talk to people anymore and I am just always on the edge. Waiting for something to bad happen it seems. Like maybe PTSD from these jobs. I am also high strung so that doesn’t help and I anger very easily.

There isn’t a single person I’ve met who makes me feel like living is the preferred option. My one parent isn’t really a support for me.

My other family, of which there’s two, are elderly and don’t really need to be supporting me but they let me live in a side property that I don’t deserve.

There isn’t a reality where I keep living like this and make it out content, and all I hope for is it to end quickly.

1mqctnd,I may have been harassed and not know,"I have a lot of problems, I have depression, anxiety and some disorder like CBT. Recently I ended up wondering if I possibly harassed my younger cousin and I can't remember, I don't know why I thought about it, but it was simply put in my head and now it doesn't come out, I now tend to wonder if I really did it, and I always feel sad and depressed about this hypothesis.

This came about when I realized that I didn't talk as much to my cousin as before, we act normally and treat each other very well, I love her and I'm proud to be her cousin, but over time I realized that she stopped talking so much and came to my house to see me or her grandparents (I live with my grandparents, and my house is very close to her house). I'm 19 years old, and she must be at least 12 years old, maybe more or less, I don't know if it's because she's entering the teenage phase, but part of it makes me imagine that it's my cause.

I'm almost sure I would never do that to her, but it's that damn ALMOST that screws with my head. I don't know what's real anymore, I can't stop thinking about it, I'm afraid I touched her inappropriately at some point and I just don't remember. My screwed up head creates possible scenarios in which I could have committed, and this confuses me and makes me more scared.

A fact that I don't want to leave behind: At 8 years old I was harassed and almost molested by her older brother, who is older than me too, and at the time I didn't tell anyone about it out of fear. I don't know if this changes anything, but I'm afraid of being like him.",1755204616.0,1,3,depression,depression
1mqct17,Losing myself slowly,"Hi everyone, hope all is well. I’ve been feeling extremely down and anxious for the past couple of months in my life. When I say that I mean that my emotional health is in the gutters, I constantly have a knot in my throat, I find it hard to force smiles, just in general feeling very depressed and it won’t go away. I used to be very popular in university, I fell out with the majority of those friends, I have around 2-3 real friends in total that I consider good friends.

I’m a 25 year old engineer from Ireland. I’m pretty creative, love to love, in touch with my emotions. It’s just like the title says. I’m losing myself. I need help. Advice, similar experiences, coping mechanisms, anything would be very helpful and appreciated.

I come from a Middle eastern background, a wonderful small but loving family, now quite distant to one another because everyone grew up, made their own little families and moved far away. I’ve been living with my mum and sister for the past 15-20 years because my dad is full time working in the Middle East. I know this left a lot of core wounds like anxious attachment, abandonment issues, etc that I’m fully aware of and trying to work on, but lately it’s been feeling extra heavy. 

I recently proposed to my fiancee, gave her a dream proposal, she said yes! We’ve been together for around 2 years, we have our ups and downs but don’t we all. She’s a dentist, earns a good income and is very attractive. I often find myself being disappointed or feel not enough for her, not because shes making me feel that way, but because I hold myself to a much higher standard in terms of financial income. 

I grew up with the idea of a man should be the leader of a family, and a woman should be the pillar of the man. Maybe times have changed, maybe men and women are considered more equal in some sense, but personally, I grew up with a lot of that mentality. As a man, my job is to protect, provide, and love my future wife. I don’t want to control her, tell her what to do, etc. Lately I noticed I’ve been speaking bad things to myself about this topic without even wanting to. An example of this could be that I’d feel insecure at times about how she earns more money than me, and how this might affect our husband/wife dynamic. It shouldn’t affect it in a perfect world, but it’s something else that just pops into my mind and I spiral within my own head. I feel my subconscious trying to sabotage me. I don’t like to feel this way man. 

I’ve developed this mentality of “I’m 25 years old, don’t even have 10,000 euro saved up, and need to make good money fast so I can start my own family and start my life.” I know you could look at it from another perspective and say “I’m 25, healthy, both parents alive, and aren’t in any debt”, which would also be very correct but it gets harder and harder to think of it like that. 

Over the past year, I’ve been trying to learn how to day trade. It’s been kicking my ass to put it simply, haven’t had a single payout. I’m very obsessive when it comes to something that I put my mind to. This is a big aspect, I think, of why I’m feeling very low self esteem and have confidence issues within myself. I’m at a low in my life mentally, where when people that look at it from the outside might not even understand. It feels lonely. In science, loneliness is the #1 worst feeling a human can apparently feel, and I feel lonely 90% of the time I’m awake. 

I don’t feel listened to, heard or present when I’m talking to my sister, my mother or my dad. I live at home with them but it doesn’t even feel like they’re family anymore. I want to move out and live with my fiancée, but right now I can’t afford to do so properly. 

There’s so much more to type which I won’t bore you guys with, but if you’re curious I’m more than happy to answer any questions. 

TLDR: Mentally, my life is falling apart, and I don’t know how to get out of this hole. It’s ruining my mentality, my relationships and making me miserable, like I’ve forgotten how to be happy. I need some advice or help.

1mqb0a2,Things have only gotten worse.,"This is definitely not the worst situation in the world, but it’s pretty tough to be going through this non-stop for the past couple of years. 

Basically, I just graduated law school and I don’t have a job lined up. I went to a highly-ranked school where like 60% of the students go onto get their first job paying $225k/year. The other 40% either didn’t want those sort of jobs and ended up at other places that they find more fulfilling, interesting, etc. And then among a much, much smaller portion of that group are the people who are unemployed after law school. Unfortunately, that’s me. 

I wasn’t necessarily some superstar in law school, but I know for a fact that I was decent enough to not have ended up in this position. My GPA was pretty average, but I also did lots of competitions, clubs, journals and interned during the school year. I networked a ton (which was ultimately the biggest waste of time in the world) and had applied to hundreds of jobs throughout school. When I was interviewed, people seemed to like me well enough. I did tons of mock interviews as well to sharpen my skills and had only ever received positive feedback. In my second year alone, I’d sent out over 1000 applications. Despite all of my hard work, I don’t have a job lined up. 

I constantly feel like shit over this. Up until this point, I was always viewed by those close to me as this successful go-getter who excelled academically and had his priorities straight. Nobody in my life knows about this struggle either. I want so badly to keep up this appearance, but it’s only a matter of time until people realize that I’m a failure. 

I started taking antidepressants during my last year of law school, although I wish I’d started much sooner. However, I have days where I just spiral into these intense bouts of depression and suicidal ideation. 

I don’t really have any friends from law school since I felt so ashamed of my lack of career prospects that I just shut everyone out and avoided hanging out with people entirely. I didn’t go to any events and didn’t even go to my own graduation. 

I’m just venting at this point but this shit sucks so much and I hate how much of an impact it’s had on my life. It started my second semester of law school and has only gotten worse. I thought things would improve eventually, but everything just sucks all the time. ",1755200678.0,1,0,depression,depression

1mqalpg,Do I actually have depression?,"As the title says. I’ve tried therapy twice and I kind of hate it or maybe I just don’t find it super helpful. My journey started shortly after I got married in May 2023, I was also feeling overworked and stressed at my job. Then we started house-hunting and I got anxious as hell and felt like I was moving so fast, but at the same time wondering what’s my next step since I just got married. All of that made me experience physical anxiety symptoms for the first time in my life and shortly after I think I got depressed. Before all that I did have issues with some minor anxiety (regular life stuff like anxious about rollercoasters or public speaking) AND my husband and I did have some communication issues and I would literally cry all the time and couldn’t navigate conflict. I think this could’ve been emotional dysregulation but idk.

My anxiety has gotten better 2 years later, but I’m still this way and it sucks. I still overthink and I have a slight tremor in my hand, but at least no panic attacks or weird feelings like overstimulation. I took SSRI’s and it helped alleviate symptoms but I feel so low in energy, lack of motivation and I still ruminate/overthink a lot. I do feel low a lot but I try to look forward to small things that I still like, shopping, shows, hanging with friends.

I don’t have hobbies either and I want to work on that but motivation is so low. I’m sad because I feel a bit broken and I gained weight which just makes me feel even worse.

Confidence and self esteem are down too. I’m trying to be happy because I have great people around me but I still feel like I’m struggling. This new psych nurse practitioner doesn’t think I’m depressed because sometimes I do appear that way but maybe I’m good at masking. I could also have ADHD cause I have some symptoms but idk for sure. Maybe stimulants will work once we try but right now I don’t feel any better on Guanfacine and I’m still taking 150mg XL Wellbutrin.

 Desde que el me presento a su familia me di cuenta que ellos se sienten envidia mutuamente y yo no era la excepción a mí me trataban como si fuera sirvienta solo porque yo vengo de una familia voy a decirle humilde porque tampoco éramos tan pobre ahí mi papá medio resolvía pero las mujeres de esa familia buscaban la más mínima excusa para humillarme pero no lo tomaba enserio.

Lo peor vino cuando quede embarazada de mi primera bebé mi suegra me decía por teléfono que mi bebé era de ella, decía, esa bebé es mía yo no le hacía caso, mi pareja y yo para ese entonces vivíamos alquilados y no podíamos tener a nadie más con nosotros, bueno pasaron los nueve meses, di a luz y todo bien, cuando la niña estaba por cumplir seis meses encontramos 🏠 propia, ahí empezó la pesadilla.

 Mi cuñada lleva a mi suegra para la casa sin consultarme me quedé tranquila pensé, eso es sólo unos días pero no duró ocho meses viviendo con nosotros, eso era horrible ella hacía que mi pareja no me tomara en cuenta, me llamaba floja, le decía a mi pareja que no trataba bien a la niña y Dios sabrá que otras cosas le habrá dicho lo bueno de todo eso es que mi pareja hacía caso omiso por lo menos.

Un día me empecé a sentir rara no queria caminar, solo quería dormir y otras cositas más cuando platico con mi mamá sobre eso, ella me dice, hija no será que estás embarazada otra vez, a mí se me fue el mundo decidí que iba  a comprobarlo y si estaba embarazada pero por el estrés de mi suegra y otras cosas que no voy a mencionar no lo había notado antes. 

En ese momento tenía ocho meses de embarazo cuando mi suegra se entera, empezó a ver cómo raro no me quería hablar se la pasaba gritandome hasta que en una discusión me dijo que mi segundo embarazo no era de su hijo, que esa bebé porque si fue otra nena, no era su nieta, su hijo yo sabíamos perfectamente que si era de el pero ella con tal de separarnos inventó eso lo ultimo que me quedo hacer fue echarla de mi casa...

Its only been the past 6months where I have actually realised iv been this way for many years not as bad though. Seeking therapy has helped, and especially being more vulnerable with my dad and my girlfriend. Which Iv also found out that vulnerability is something i have never really experienced properly until recently. Recently I hit an all time low tho, feeling so lost in life, smoking weed in the evenings to pass time where I wasn't scared or anxious about doing nothing and feeling like nothing, going to bed as late as I can as I couldnt fall asleep naturally because of the anxiety of waking up the next day feeling so empty. Each day felt like a challenge to make it to the end, occupiing myseld with doomscrolling to prevent my brain going numb. But with recent events and those things, right now im thriving, I have a good routine, go to the gym, play chess, wake up pretty early, dont go to bed too late, keep everthing around me tidy and take care of myself properly. All this happiness and vulnerablity has made me feel more alive, and more human. But with that iv seen the truth of how much of an insecure individual ive been all these years growing up, my biggest peve is silently judging others in my mind. Now I know all those thoughts and feelings to others sometimes putting them down in my mind were just my own insecurities. But the same goes both ways when you spend your life judging you always feel judged. that judgment also comes with the suppression of expression and happiness iv also found and that is a pretty miserable way of living iv found. So now whenever I find my ego or insecurities trying to put someone else down, I flip it into some kind of happy and postive thought. And i feel like in time with enough practice I will be able to shut silly negative judgemental thoughts out but i just want to know if theres anything else I can do to help this.

I dont want to be a judgy person, I don't want to see the world negatively - its not fun. So any advice would really help. Thank you",1755199594.0,1,0,depression,depression

1mq99yw,My cup can never be filled.,"I’m a 31 year old woman who has suffered with severe depression since I was 19, I’ve also had anxiety since 14, and right now I feel extremely depressed. I think me getting my menstrual cycle for the first time in 2 months doesn’t help so I’m also PMSing, but I’m sitting at work and I can’t focus on my tasks because I want to break down in tears.

I can look back at my life as far as my brain can remember and see that I’ve lived a decent life, it wasn’t perfect, but who’s is? I’ve dealt with some things, but I have been working harder to over come it. 

One thing I can’t overcome is that life doesn’t seem to bring me joy, I don’t think it ever has at least not since elementary school and I know I’m probably not alone in that. I recently got married and he makes me happy, he’s my best friend, he’s supportive and my rock. I don’t know what I’d do without him. And his happiness is what brings me joy. I like watching him build his life and accomplish his goals. I know a lot of them are centered around me and his son. He wants to build a life for us and I’m happy to be along for the ride. 

I feel like I live for him because I don’t care to live for myself. I’ve tired to live for myself and make decisions based on my happiness and got tired of it. It’s not enjoyable for me. I’ve quit jobs because I’ve gotten burnt out and then it turned to chronic job hopping which I think looks bad. I’m not a bad worker, just never satisfied in the work. I either push too hard into burnout, there’s no more opportunity the job can bring or it was an opportunity I wanted to try but learned I was bad at it. 


 I moved down to this small town in January,  and I’m currently on my third job since then.. right now…I’m trying to get my insurance license with a State Farm in my town. I’ve failed that test twice with a 62% and need a 70%. Thing is? It’s not my dream job or my passion, I’m only doing it because it’s the highest paying job in the small town. And I don’t want it, I wanna give up.

Even talking with my husband, and he has said that he thinks I’ll ever find something that’ll make me happy because I align my self worth with work.  So I look for a reason to give up on things.. 

But if I give up there’s not much else I can go searching for. Nothing excites me. I have no passion or drive in a career.  And feeling that way, makes me feel worthless. I see working only as a means of survival. But I see people who are passionate in what they do and am envious. 

I just don’t think I was meant for anything and I understand why I’ve failed at a lot or lost some people along the way, this attitude is terrible to be around. And I do my best to be positive, but right now I’m back to feeling so lost in life.. it’s hard.. and frustrating. 

I’m gonna take a more serious look into therapy… because I can’t live like this anymore if I choose to live at all.

1mq86gv,I think I might be getting depressed again,"TLDR: was doing fine, moved to a new city, now  I've started getting tired and withdrawn and rethinking everything not sure what to do

To add context, I was previously diagnosed with depression when I was a teenager(16 or 17)  which I later recovered from, and was later diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19.

For a while I figured that was it, that I could deal with my symptoms if I approached them from a perspective of someone living with ADHD. I have had certain periods of time(a couple weeks to sometimes a month) where I have been extremely unhappy, but for the most part I charted it down to external circumstances in my life at the time. In addition I had a pretty bad falling out with close friends who were super toxic and left me in a pretty low part of my life. Made a vow to not see these people again, went NC, and I was doing much better until about a few weeks ago.I just made a pretty big life decision to move to a new city to study, and life was finally looking good. I reconnected with old friends, explored around, made plans with my partner and picked up part time work. 

Lately though, everything is getting really tiring? I gave myself enough breaks but I'm struggling to wake myself up in the mornings and have a reason to go about my day. Life is starting to feel a bit pointless, where I don't know why I am even trying to do all these fun things, and I am forgetting why I moved here, and why I even want to study what I've picked. It feels scary to think about how much effort I have to put into just making sure I can get by day to day. Today I woke up and I am so dizzy that I could barely get out the house, I feel like I'm so drained that I can't even talk to my partner or my friends and I'm getting really sad for no reason at all, over and over again. I don't want to keep crying to my partner, he says it will get better, but I don't want to drain him out when I'm like this.

I don't know what to do. Should I bring this up to the GP? I've tried antidepressants before mainly Prozac and it makes me so numb, ADHD medications take way too long to prescribe and I don't know if I can wait that long. Please help, thanks",1755194567.0,1,0,depression,depression

1mq5wnd,Lessons From Almost Thirty Years -- You Have To Commit or Go All In Into Something,"LESSONS FROM ALMOST THIRTY YEARS OF DEPRESSION *

My whole life I have suffered from crippling depression. So much so that I started to feel like it was a permanent fixture of my personality. Tried therapists. Did not work. Even medicine and prescription drugs. Nope. 

Nothing good about it but what could I do? 

It's only recently by God's grace that I have found some solutions to the problem. I am not 100% correct but I just want to share what I have learnt in the hopes that it helps people. 

I use the words God's grace because it really was by God's grace in my experience. I do not use it to convert -- the advice I give is secular but I don't think I would have figured it out if I hadn't done prayer. The advice I give would work for anyone in any religion or spiritual belief. Even an atheist. 

The reason why I was depressed was because I didn't want to commit or go all in into something. 

Why didn't I want go all in into something or commit into something? 

Fear of failure. 

My whole life I have spent it with one foot in the door and another outside it. Why? Because I believed that that was how you mitigated the effects of failure. But all it did was create confusion in my mind. Depression. 

It's only recently that I have started to commit to things. By committing I mean going all in, shaping my life around achieving whatever goal it is I want to achieve as opposed to what I was doing when I was younger -- just doing enough to ensure that I benefit but don't suffer if I fail. 

I did fail when I committed but I discovered something interesting -- even if you fail, there is always a consolation prize in some form to help you keep on going or help you commit to something  else more in alignment to who you are. 

You know that song -- You Can't Always Get What You Want by the Rolling Stones. The verse goes something like this.

You can't always get what you want 
but if you try sometime, you just might find
You get what you need. 

It's exactly like that. At least in my experience. 

But if you are afraid of failure, you end up doing nothing. And the results of doing nothing is nothing. You are not participating in life which you are a part of which is where I think depression comes from. 

I am not saying be dumb but what I am saying is that you should not let the fear of failure stop you from committing to something which is the essence of participating in life. 

Please let me know what you think.

1mpt5oh,I’m so unlikable that I think my own sister doesn’t like me anymore.,"Title. 
I (21) am not necessarily socially awkward, but I’m not really charming, either. I have had and continue to have friends, but I’ve never felt true belonging and have found that more often than not, I struggle to get close to people and they end up leaving. I’ve been lonely my entire life, and it’s only gotten worse as I’ve gotten older. Growing up, my twin sister was my best friend and she has helped me through my feelings of loneliness. Regardless of my social life, I knew that I could talk to her and that she cared. In the past two years, though, I’ve started to notice that she doesn’t really spend time with me or talk to me anymore. 

Whenever I talk to her, she’s always on her phone. When I bring up how she doesn’t seem like she wants to talk, she always says that she’s tired and just not feeling it right now, or wants alone time. The thing is, it’s literally every time I try to spend time with her. I’ve tried to figure out if it’s something I’m doing and correct it; I ask her questions about herself, I don’t bother her when she seems busy or agitated, I try in general to be a good sister. I’ve stopped talking about my mental health and personal issues with her, because I thought that maybe it’s a burden for her and she’s tired of that. We’re still close, but I feel that fundamentally, she just doesn’t like *me*.

It’s hard not to let it get to me. I already feel so unlikable to everyone else, and she’s pretty much been my only reason to stay alive for the past 6ish years. The few times I’ve brought it up, she gets upset and vehemently denies it. I can’t help but notice her behavior, though. I don’t know what to do. What is wrong with me?

His psychiatrist has been strongly opposed to prescribing an antidepressant, and instead has tried a wide range of antipsychotics, along with lithium, lamotrigine, and stimulants like Vyvanse. None of these have worked.

He also underwent 36 sessions of TMS with no results.

His depression is worsening by the day. He is not suicidal.

I’m not a mental health professional, but as his partner watching him suffer for nearly 10 months with no improvement, I can’t help but feel that an antidepressant may be worth trying.

We have another appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow, and I really want to go prepared to advocate for what’s best for him.

If your loved one with bipolar depression has experienced anything similar, what treatments helped them out of the depression?

Literally every session is the same. On top of that she always asks “what do you want from therapy” or says “if you aren’t going to *do*, I can’t help you.” Like, fuck. I don’t know. 

She was usually really funny and kind in the beginning, but it’s only been 2-3 months and she’s already turned sour. Last session I had with her she was suddenly super harsh saying that she was “talking to me like all the other men/boys cause they need to be told things directly without it being sugar coated.” ???

Left anything of any real importance. My brother from out of state ended up coming to stay thru the 100 days so that I would have a caregiver. Since my spouse left the mental anguish is excruciating.

1mpqrof,"I’ve been adding a pill each time I wanted to not be here, but I’m close to the point of no return.","Hi so this is a bit of a rant and to be fair I don’t care if anyone reads this in the end. I just want to type out my feelings.

I’ve been depressed for about 10 years now. Well obviously it’s been kind of on and off, but I’ve been struggling a lot since the death of my mother when I was 10yo. After that I struggled with motivation in school and in life in general. I think the first time I wanted to die was when I was 11 because that’s when I was forced into seeing a psychologist. I’ve seen a couple over the years but ultimately it never worked out for me, even when I put the effort into it. I’ve taken a few antidepressants but I don’t like their effects on me. 
Ever since I’ve had periods where getting out of bed is just out of the question. School destroys me and I keep dropping out on and off even though I have great grades. It destroys me partly because I can’t find anything I like. I’m trying to find a university program that seems to suit me and that I like. But I don’t like anything. I can’t find pleasure in anything. A lot of people I’ve seen to help guide my choices past highschool say that it’s hard to help me because I lack “life” or what makes me human. 
I think that just brings me to say that I don’t think I’ve felt genuine happiness in a long time. I’ve found people that bring me happiness, but ultimately they all end up leaving and the hurt they leave behind is agonizing. I’ve lost so many. Life hurt me so much that I learned to treat others like how life treated me. I don’t have friends right now. Some I pushed away because I self Destruct a lot. Some left me because of the way I am. The only person that stays is my ex but he’s quick to remind me that I’ve hurt him and if I wasn’t so depressed he wouldn’t be talking to me rn. I know he still cares about me but I’ve hurt him. I acknowledge that and I try to redeem myself in any way I can. I won’t hide from my flaws. Please don’t come at me for this, in the end we both hurt each other.
Also, because of what I mentioned previously, I developed a dependent/anxious attachment to my partners. I still love my ex deeply. He’s the only reason I’m here right now. My attachment style really destroyed me and because of that I find it hard to trust anyone with me. My heart and my mind. 
I’m utterly alone. I could go on and on about things in my life that brought me to where I am now. But I won’t. I’ll spare you the details lol. Since 2020, my depression has gotten so bad that I’ve been hoping to not be here. To cope I started taking pills every time it got to that point. And I’d add one. The last time this has happened I ended up sick. Yes the police was called but I actually have no idea how but I convinced them I was fine. Like istg, you’d think they train brainless people, or maybe I’m just good at convincing people. 
So yeah. I’m at my lowest. I don’t find pleasure in anything. I’ve tried many different kinds of therapy and pills and going out and whatever over the years but I’m still stuck. I think I’m a horrible person. I couldn’t even keep the one person that gave me hope in life. I can’t get out of bed anymore. Sometimes I tell myself I do that to myself for attention. But I try to believe that what I feel is actual distress. 
I know I’m not alone, but I’d like to know when this pain will end or if I’ll end up dying. Living is a pain. Am I alone in this? Please tell me it gets better or something ",1755146155.0,5,2,depression,depression

1mppkr1,The Other Side,"Not sure if anyone will see this, but it felt important to share.

A year ago I was slipping into the worst depression of my life. I’d had depressive episodes before, but this was different. It was like a dementor had sucked every emotion out of me and I was in this bottomless pit of numb. 

I ended up hospitalized and this year has been a journey of feeling somewhat okay, then not okay, then somewhat okay again. 

I realized today that at some point, the sadness shifted and evolved to something bearable. I can’t pinpoint the exact moment, but that unbearable pain isn’t there anymore. 

I feel love when I look at my dog. I noticed the sunset. I laughed at a meme. Small things, but so drastically different from a year ago. 

I’m not going to say something cheesy like “it gets better” or “we matter.” I just wanted to point out that, despite the bullshit depression tells us, that sadness will shift, and change, and there are going to be moments when you are okay again. 

Remember, feelings themselves can’t actually harm us. They are heavy and painful, but we wouldn’t have so much pain unless we’re capable of feeling the exact opposite emotion, too. 

The earth is too damn big for there not to be peace for us out there. Keep fighting, be easy on yourself, and keep talking to people about what you’re going through. There is another side to all of this. ",1755142391.0,3,1,depression,depression

1mpvkg5,Can you turn off your feelings?,"I've been suffering from depression, PTSD, and an emotional disorder for some time. I didn't really believe in mental illness before, but now I live with these diagnoses – and it's a huge burden. I often feel lonely, I have not much friends, and my only close friends are my sisters. Nevertheless, I often don't want to go out because I perceive myself as unattractive – even though I was often told I was very beautiful before my illness. Sometimes I react very irritably or meanly and start crying for no apparent reason. Even on vacation, when everything seems fine, I suddenly feel depressed – sometimes because of things that aren't real, but come from books, for example. I'm often ashamed of my emotions because no one would expect me to be so sensitive. Sometimes I wish I couldn't feel anything at all. My mother and my therapist are trying to help me, but my therapist is also threatening to send me to a clinic or group home, which I don't want and which is further overwhelming for me. Have any of you had similar experiences? How did you deal with it? And is it even possible to ""switch off"" your emotions?",1755162971.0,0,7,depression,depression

1mpp39x,"After this experience, maybe I really should go","Please don’t judge me.

Hi everyone, I’ve been kind of spiraling. I don’t have friends to talk to about this, at all. I don’t have anyone. 

If you look at my last post on my account, you’ll see why. I didn’t go through with it. Still here, but I’m doing worse. 

I did a very stupid thing, I was very drunk last week. I don’t usually get drunk like that. But I just wanted to stop thinking and so I went to my usual bar, saw my usual people. 


 I got flirty, I get flirty when I get drunk and I know that’s stupid and dangerous. 


I met this guy, we went to his car and we started making out. Which I also never do, then he pulled out his thing and I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that but he kept saying please and pulling down my head. 

And so I did. And he finished in my mouth, I got out and started crying and threw up. I don’t remember when I gave him my number because when I woke up the next day, he was texting me. 

I avoided him for 2 days but he still kept texting. I said “hey sorry, was sick and busy with work” he said “oh I’m sorry you’re sick” 

He then asked if we were still on for Friday. I was confused and told him I didn’t know what he was talking about. He said “we’re hanging out Friday so you better be there, you promised me sex” I don’t ever remember saying that! 

He then knew I didn’t have a car for work and said he can pick me up. I didn’t respond. 2 min later he wrote back “wow, no response” 

I’m sick to stomach, I made an appointment with planned parenthood to get tested. I just hope I didn’t get anything. 

I feel so gross. And him texting me like this, kinda scares me. I can’t believe I did this with a stranger. 

I brushed my mouth 10 times when I woke up. I finished half a bottle of mouth wash, idk if that’s bad for my mouth but I didn’t care. I just can’t get the taste out. ",1755140921.0,3,1,depression,depression

He then told me if I’m uncomfortable to answer now I could make another appointment at a different time. Asked for how long I was living alone as in what year I moved out and why.

1mpoka5,I feel like I'm always an afterthought,"I feel like I'm selfish saying this, but I hate feeling like I dont really have friends who show up for me as often as others do.

I have a couple really close friends I know I can rely on, and I'm very blessed for that. But obviously they have their own lives and can't make it to every event, which makes sense. 

For context I'm a singer, so every once in a while I'm in a performance. I had one tonight, and I was the only person there without someone to support them. One of my other friends was also involved and a few mutuals came, but they obviously came for her since they brought her flowers. We did chat and I did get a chance to hug them, which I really appreciated. But it really feels like I'm an add on instead of someone they really wanted to see.

It also didnt help that this was a contest that ended up having an audience voting mechanic. On such a small scale, I feel like voting can come down to who brought the most people with them. It wasn't the end-all-be-all of the judging, but it just made me feel really insecure, which I know is silly.

What really stung is my parents didn't come either. In their defense, they came a couple weeks ago to a different performance I had, which I really appreciated. But I hate feeling like I can be performing to a crowd and not have anyone really there to support me.

It really feels that way for most other aspects of my life as well. I feel like people like me and I'm personable, but a lot of times I feel like I really don't really have friends. I know a lot of that is because of me. I have trouble checking in with people which I'm trying to work on. But I think over all I just feel really really lonely. 

I dont know what to do. Everything is spiraling rn. I'm out of money, the only thing that makes me happy is contributing to my money problems (I'm the lead in a musical a few towns over and gas is eating up my budget), I can't afford to go back to therapy, I love my job but it doesnt pay me enough, Im always tired, and I feel like im just so stupid.",1755139393.0,3,1,depression,depression

1mpoemu,"Life has no inherent value, and I think death is a completely valid choice","I've been thinking about this for months now, and really, life is just gambling, or investing if you're into that. You have your risks and your rewards, and you get to make your decisions to pick safe options that might add up over time, risky ones that can either win you big or ruin you, or make bad ones that you didn't really analyze before picking and leave you broke. You can even look over some samples and time frames to decide wether a decision is more likely to favor you, if it's too volatile, or if it's just destined to fail

(Think getting a lobotomy, for example. It's got an awful history, awfully high risk and seemingly no payoff, so although you could get it, you most definitely shouldn't!"")

If you've made some bad investments and it's led up to a point where you're bleeding ""money"" every moment and struggling to even get by, you've got two main choices: Keep suffering and eating moldy bread until you either get a few lucky shots and maybe, just MAYBE get to feel ""alright"", or ""good"" if you really get a jackpot, at the expense of being dragged through a minefield until then, or you quit. Sure, you could take a loan, try to make a last shot, big investment that might give you that 1 in a billion boost that could turn your life around, but realistically, you're just going into extreme debt, and that debt you can't pay is going to anyone who's supporting you, because, funnily enough, being loved in this situation, contrary to what liars who want you to feel good may say, turns you into a source of constant collateral damage!

If you quit, though, that's certainty and an end to your debts. You're not winning big or turning anything around, of course, but you'll even your game at a nice 0. That constant suffering ripping you of the resources, the hope and the humanity while you do your best to grasp at the straws of the shit people who are far better off than you keep telling, about your jackpot right around the corner? It's over. You can rest.

People say ""You have so much to live for!"", ""You're a coward if you do it!"", and ""Think about [X] and [Y], they love you! Do it for them!"", but what they seem to fail to consider is that this is basic risk assessment. For some of us, the risk simply doesn't come even close to justifying the cost, even if the reward is great. I'm not going to bet 10 years of my empathy being chipped away, leaving a void and then being replaced with hatred and jealousy for the abysmal, almost unnoticeable chance of MAYBE, and that's another minimal chance within this one, being happy. Optimism is a real delusion. This world is built on risk and reward, it's essentially a gamble, and unless you're either very lucky or very smart, the game is rigged from the start. Plus, even if I do have people who love me, I'd be doing this for them. My bad decisions should cost me, and me alone, and even if they'll feel terrible when I'm gone, at least I know that, in the long term, the pain they'd experience because of me alive would be many times worse than the immediate one caused by grief. And far as I know, dying in the interest of protecting those who love you is a death more noble than anything, is it not?

Anyways, good to get this off my chest. I like to think about stuff.

That's why I think suicide is a fine choice, and I think it should be respected practice. People who want to end their suffering aren't cowards, they just aren't interested in exchanging constant pain for a dream that's always far out of reach anymore. And if you don't get it, then hey, I'm happy you don't have do go through this. Good for you.",1755138934.0,3,1,depression,depression

I'm stuck. We're all stuck. Is anyone really happy? I find happiness an impossible concept without some kind of mental disorder that makes them not care about the suffering of others. Why do we put this burden on others? We're sick. Every last one of us is sick to one degree or another.

1mplqfk,Existential Depression?,"I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder when i was 15. That was five years ago- and at the time I wasnt attractive, i wasn’t in an ideal living situation, i was dealing with parent drama, and on top of everything dealing with teenage hormones. So I find my depressive episodes from back then to be much more understandable than my episodes now…

Ever since college, my depression has felt a little different. I am decently pleased with my appearance now, i have a good living situation and both my parents love and support me. But for some reason, its like the emptiness in my being is much worse than the emptiness i felt a few years ago.

This sadness is different, i think im realizing that i am feeling true hopelessness. I cant really say that anything *super* bad has happened to me, but thats because im always thinking of my situations in comparison to other’s situations. If something really crappy happens to me, i get very emotional about it…but then i get even more emotional that there will always be someone dealing with a situation worse than me. And if im feeling this bad, imagine how that someone else is feeling?

I can’t watch the news, or scroll on social media, or even google something without hearing some horrible information that i wish i could erase from memory. I look at how the world operates, how earth operates, and the thought that I dont belong here always slams in my mind.

I feel like earth is not where im meant to be. Sure there are a lot of things that i love that im grateful i got to experience on earth. Trust me i love so many things. But the constant feeling of dread ive been having recently, along with the constant feeling of sadness that nothing will ever change (at least while im alive) it makes me question what the point of even staying actually is.

The more i think about our lives, and genuinely use my brain, the more i feel like living on earth is truly hell. I dont think any being should be this self aware to the point of their detriment. I just dont understand why so many humans have to be so evil. I dont want to be here on this world with so many truly malicious people. I know there are so many good people, but even sometimes the people you think are good turn out to be bad. And thats what hurts me the most because I don’t know who to trust.

I am just so worried because i feel like my reasons to commit are morphing from things that can be changed and solved to things that are just part of society. And even then, who am I to put the blame on society? I stick around long enough to witness the clown show continue every day, and thats my fault.

On the second day of middleschool I wanted to die. I was sad. I was broken. Spent the entire year experiencing bullying just like in the movies then moved schools. I felt happier but not really. I was still sad. Things changed when I became an adult. I thought I'd found happiness at work but then I felt a little empty and lonely. Thought love was the answer. It broke me so bad when she dumped me that I couldn't function. I got asked to resign. Then my dog died. Then I got kicked out of my apartment. I did get another job a few months later. Still carried that emptiness and loneliness in me. I still felt that love was what I needed in the form of a partner. I also tried to make friends too. I made some good friends. I went through 3 relationships and the last one broke me far more than the others. Not because it was toxic. Heck the one before the last one was the worst. I was burying dead cats every week for a month because she brought a sick cat to her place and it infected her other cats. Then she cheated on me. And gaslit me. Made me feel like trash, called me stuff like a himbo. 

And yet the last one hurt so much more because it felt right. It felt healthy. It felt home. I lost the person that felt like home to me. The one that would comfort me. Because she was tired and felt we were a mismatch. I was shattered. I still am broken. I wish I could truly move on.

Life feels like a chore. Like it really isn't worth living anymore. I thought if I go out and play football (soccer) again maybe I'll feel better but i just wanted to stop playing after 10 minutes.

1mpov2c,Success doesn’t help at all,"First time creating a post. I hate the idea that money/success alleviates depression. I’ve always been “high functioning”. 

I’m in my 30’s, work in the medical field, have a doctorate degree, and make just over 200k. I have a brand new home (built this year) the new corvette (2023) and have always had pretty women/ endless dating partners and good friends. 

It doesn’t help. I feel more depressed/anxious now after obtaining “success” than when I was a broke student who didn’t know what to do with their life.  I wasn’t always like this. 

Countless meds, therapists, gyming (been working out for over 10 years now) and nothing truly relieves weight of depression and anxiety. Can anyone else relate? I just feel worn down. ",1755140265.0,2,6,depression,depression
1mpa6nm,I'm pretty positive that I'm cursed to have a bad life.,"Nothing has ever really gone right for me, and if it's going right, i always and i mean **ALWAYS** fuck it up some how. I'm 30 yrs old with nothing to my name, no education, no job, no money, not a lot of friends, constantly betrayed by people i called my friends, constantly hating myself because im ugly and incredibly unattractive, I'm unable to do anything on my own without someone holding my hand due to how badly i've fucked my life up and that im too scared to do anything on my own to no risk fucking it up further. 

My life by all means is a joke and everyday i'm more convinced to wanna take my life because nothing is getting better and i'm not smart enough to make it better. I'm scared to take my life, but at the same time i rather be dead than continue to be a disappointment to everyone i care about(if i still even care about anyone)

Idk what to do anymore, and no one in my life is actually trying to help me. They give me temp solutions and refuse to actually listen and realize how bad of a position I'm in. My own father rather gamble away his money than help me and my mom can die any day now from the fent AND crack she fucking takes.

1mp8pbm,My parents joke constantly about my state of being.,"Hi everyone, 20 here. I still live with my parents sadly. It’s been around a month I decided to straight up avoid and short the interactions with them because I can’t stand it anymore. They know my mental state but still use the excuse of “just joking” and “we do it to motivate you” or “we’re just worried” to criticize me and my actions daily. For instance, I was just told by my mother that my room is shit and that I am obliged to clean it. I told her clearly, like every time, that this isn’t something someone like me wants to hear, and ofc she blamed it on me saying I’m too sensitive and take everything personally. This happens with everything to the point I just stopped talking with them. I’ve been in this state for two years now and communication doesn’t work, I tried it so much. They “joke” that I’m lazy, pressure me constantly that I need to do something, act offended if I tell them I don’t feel like doing what they want me to do or simply don’t wanna talk. I’m the one called evil if I want to just be alone.

I don’t even have the energy, how am I supposed to solve this or move out? I am scared and I feel alone. Of course I have a therapist already and she knows about it, but she hasn’t given me any real solutions and in a way I understand why. How can I think about leaving if I can’t even do the simplest of tasks most of the time? I’m always nervous around them, and just about being home. I wish I had a supportive family.",1755101469.0,14,5,depression,depression
1mpdivr,How the fuck can a person who has so much going for them be such a wreck.,"Preface: I don't know if this is the appropriate subreddit to post this in. Feel free to take it down if it is not.

I've got a good education, finished a bachelor in CS and pursuing a master's now. I managed to hold down a good job for a while, but ended up quitting to focus on my studies. I've got a supportive mom who helps me stay afloat.

And yet I just can't bring myself to function like a normal human being. I don't know how so many people go about their lives, ticking like clockwork. They dutifully go through the motions every day, they have a set time to prepare food, a set time to mow the lawn, a set time to clean their house, etc., and every single week they go through with everything.

I almost can't bring myself to do anything on a schedule. I can only really function doing things on a here-and-now basis. If the apartment is unclean, then maybe the 10th time I feel guilty about it, I'll finally get around to actually cleaning the place. If I'm dangerously close to running out of clean underwear, I'll wait until almost the last possible moment to actually wash the stuff and avert catastrophe.

Whenever I get into a proper routine, it almost always ends up crashing into a wall of ""what's the point"". Why spend so much of your precious limited time on this earth cleaning this stupid thing, when you could be doing something else.

The rest of my time, I just try to escape. When I was a kid, there wasn't really much of anything for me to do at home; my parents are divorced, and my single mom had to work her ass off to support us. So once I was done with the schoolday and homework, I would just disappear from this world. I would watch YouTube or cartoons all day, just to forget that I existed.

I think that was partially what got me into CS, because while programming you can just lose yourself in the task at hand, and forget about everything around you.

Eventually I decided that I didn't want to run anymore, and I wanted to build a life that I actually want to live for myself. And no sooner had I come dangerously close to being actually happy, than covid hit, and the lockdowns and online schooling were like a wave that obliterated the sandcastle that I had built for myself.

Now I feel like I will never be happy, like there is no happiness for me to be found in this world, like I was not meant for it. I keep making attempts at it, but it's mostly a swing and a miss. I just seemingly can't find a place where I'll fit, where I'll feel like the puzzle piece that completes the whole. I feel unnecessary to most places, and unnecessary to the world. I don't know why, I just don't feel at home.

Talking with people helps sometimes, and sometimes maybe not. My mom has done more than anyone else for me in this world, and yet sometimes when I ask for advice or am vulnerable with her, the response I get feels as if someone has just poured a bucket of ice cubes into your bath. So cold and matter-of-fact, that you lose your entire breath and shrivel up.

Yet other people somehow seem to get on with life. And I don't really know how.

1mpseve,I don’t think I can stay,"Albert Camus said “the only choice we have is whether to live or die”. And I feel this choice has been taken from me. I feel that I do not have the free choice to leave this world - all this pain and suffering - behind. It is because of the people who love me, and the pain that they would endure. I will not, WILL. NOT. transfer the deep misery inside of me to them. Nietzsche said “If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you”. But that’s not what I feel. I gaze into the abyss and feel it welcoming me with open arms, offering a safe harbor from the pains and fears of this life. 

I am a broken shell of who I once was, and I no longer believe that I will recover. This pains me greatly, because of all the love and support I have been shown in my life. I have a life filled with love, and yet it just can’t seem to overpower the emptiness within me.  I have been granted a wonderful life, but something is broken so deep within me that I feel it will never heal. I’ll quote Hamilton in that I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory. I just pray to the god that I know doesn’t exist that there is no afterlife to suffer through. I want peace, absolution, and a final end. Many parts of me wish that I had been killed in that car wreck in 2014. So much pain and misery might have been saved. Because the fact of the matter is that the entire summation of good that has happened in my life does nothing when compared to the pain I regularly feel.",1755151607.0,0,0,depression,depression
1mpo27k,How to be less boring with depression??,"Sorry for the long background but i feel like its necessary. I've been depressed for a while, and unsurprisingly ive lost interest in my hobbies little by little. I get that it happens but like truly i can't think of literally even one thing i actually like

I dont like video games or music, and i used to want to do both of those things professionally lol. Art too, i even tried to go to college for that one and then dropped out twice. i hate movies and most shows, and im slowly starting to hate youtube. bored of social media so i barely use that either. At this point even if i try doing things i used to like it ruins them.

this is absolutely disgusting and i feel awful but i dont like being around my family or one of my two friends either. i just don't like talking to people or being around anyone

  
if i have free time i just sleep or smoke as much weed as possible and then just sit in that spot and stare at the sky until im tired enough to sleep

I work full time but im about to quit to go to college very far away for something i dont care about because i dont know what else to do and because my friend who's also about to start college said i could move in with him 

  
heres the thing, obviously i am not a very fun or interesting person to be around because nothing is ever fun or interesting to me. I dont have an outsiders perspective, but i have to assume im probabaly miserable to tspend time with. On top of that i have nothing new to bring to a conversation because i dont like anything.  

i dont want to immediately fail college and ruin my one good friendship because of my attitude but literally not a single thing interests me at all. i tried therapists, a psychiatrist, multiple different meds that sent me spiraling deeper into depression each time. its starting to feel like those are all wastes of time and money because if anything it just got worse

I don't want to be boring and tiring and uninteresting i don't want to hate everything and everyone. thats so lame. i just want to want something, literally anything.

Amplified by the fact that I'm homeschooled and only have online friends, live in a low income household and a generally emotionally neglectful family.

 Every day has been a struggle, even with things I used to find fun. I can barely even really play video games without getting bored within 5-10 minutes.

I try to improve but it just doesn't seem worth the effort. I've been on several medications but none of them had a real significant impact and I'm seeing 2 therapists.

1mpf0o1,I feel hopeless,"Im (16F almost 17) I know I’m young and I’ve got my whole life ahead of me. I really do know that I just can’t help but feel so painfully depressed. I’ve been on antidepressants I’ve been in therapy I’ve done things like eating healthy working out going on walks I’ve tried everything and I always end up feeling awful again, I even got kicked out of college . It’s physically painful it’s not the kind of depression where I just sit in my bed and deal with it. I’ll be walking around my room breaking down because of how much I don’t wanna be alive anymore. I wouldn’t do that to my close ones not that I feel like I have anyone there for me, but I know people would care if I went, so I wouldn’t do that to them I feel so guilty. I feel like a burden to everyone and I know there’s people out there suffering with life way worse than I do. I feel so guilty for feeling so depressed when I know I’m lucky, I have my trauma though. I know if I fight through that maybe one day I will start to feel better. But generally don’t think I can get through it. Doctors won’t listen to me practically begging people for help and it feels like no one cares.

1mpn70g,Sadness,"Sadness,
When it comes, it comes for a reason.

And yet our world hates it. It is repulsive, it keeps us from being efficient, it keeps us from pleasing our bosses, our teachers, our friends.

It is as if they cared about our misery. They do not. They decided to forget their own long ago. Because of you, they remember it now.
Those who chose to live for the reason, not a reason.

Let them go.
Your hell is yours, and your torment is nothing but the fruit of your existence.

Sadness is selfish; it is what makes us act. For ourselves, for once, by force.

It may be indifferent; you must not be.
The hatred that sometimes follows can make you despise the universe.
But the universe is indifferent; you are not.

It comes for a reason.

The best of reasons:
the collapse of a dream,
of a relationship,
of an idea,
of a force,
of a structure,
of an effort.

The fight against it,
We can only lose.
So we must cry, we must scream, we must howl, for we are what we are.
To deny sadness is to agree to pretend, to choose to exist empty, to forget what lies within.

Reality is to experience pain as a natural way to rebuild everything.
To drown, to choke, to suffocate.
To let it take its time, and ours.
To live the emotion, the only thing we truly have.
It will pass, along with everything it will bring.
And you, you will remain, with everything you will have brought into being.

And if it does not pass, if the time spent underwater is too long,
to drown is always nobler than to try to kill your savior.

He told me I was an addicted to my lorazepam and that he needs to get me off it. I have been taking this for years - once a day. I know it’s suppose to be a “as needed” thing for most people but it makes me able to function. I have tried lowering the dose and even have been off it for a couple months. I was close to ending myself and couldn’t hold down a job.

He says hurtful things like “know your place” every time I argue back with him and that I should feel lucky to have him. He tells me that “anyone would kill to be me” because I have him every single time I raise an issue with him he calls me ungrateful because he pays a bit more than half of the bill (he agreed to do this because he’s on double my wage and chose the house) and without him I’d have nowhere to live 

In the past two weeks, he’s kicked me out of the flat three times (the tenancy is in his name), leaving me to sleep on the floor at a friend’s place.

This treatment is wearing me down. I feel worthless ; like a piece of shit that can be thrown away whenever he’s done with me. It’s crushing to know that even the person who’s supposed to love me can treat me this way.

I have been bullied all my life school parents partners and I’m starting to think that I actually am what he says I am because how does all this happen to one person without there being a reason

1mpmv7y,High-Functioning Depression,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am quite privileged to be where I am and I am super grateful for everything but that just makes it way worse in a way...

I am diagnosed with BPD and am currently doing my masters abroad. I have a good routine, I eat well for the most part, I workout, I get all my uni work done on time but I am always in auto-pilot when I'm having to do those things. Aside from that, I feel like I am constantly seeing the world in black and white. When I'm bored at home, the doom sets in and I feel so incredibly empty. The weather is quite rainy and cold here so I just say to myself ""oh the weather's getting me down"" but even when it gets sunny, Im still my empty self. Ive been forcing myself to socialise wherever possible (don't have any good friends here aside from people I occasionally hang out with), get out of the house, but NOTHING IS WORKING. I have a lot of hobbies but I can't get myself to do them. Even as I am typing this I feel like my fingers are typing but my mind is somewhere else completely.   
My GP has prescribed me lexapro but im on a weight-loss journey so i dont want to disrupt that with the medication in fear that that will make me feel even more down. 

I really have nothing left to do...? As written above, I am genuinely doing everything in my power to hang on. I even travel from time to time which is fun in the moment but the second it ends, im back to being this empty shell of a human being. I think all I really need is one good friend around me at least?

1mph47y,I feel like I'm being dramatic by going to therapy,"
I’m 23 and my therapist thinks I have high-functioning depression and anxiety, worsened by the fact that I don’t have a support system where I live. 

Two years ago, I was sexually assaulted by a man I met on a dating app. A little after it happened, I went straight back to dating. I now think it’s because I wasn’t looking for a boyfriend as much as I was desperate for warmth. I can’t seem to make friends in this city, and I thought having a boyfriend was a greater possibility.

When I first told my mother about the assault, it was after I failed 2 of my modules. she asked if it still bothered me or affected me. I said “no,” and she moved on. That’s kind of been the story of our relationship. I was the perfect child for so long that it feels like new flaws get buffed quickly 
I rely on her financially because I'm still in university and it sometimes feels like she uses these things against me.

Before the diagnosis, we had a conversation about my therapy. She implied I might be wasting resources or at risk of becoming dependent on the therapist, which made me feel dramatic for even considering therapy. When I feel invalidated like that, it’s like my mind erases every symptom I’ve had. suddenly I can’t recall any moments of anxiety or low mood, and I start thinking maybe I’ve been fine all along.

Part of me wants to “fall apart” just to prove my pain is real. But the other part wonders… if I am capable of functioning, looking put together, doing okay in school. is this all just me making a big deal out of nothing?",1755120236.0,2,1,depression,depression

I’ve had depression for about 5 years and have been hospitalized for wanting to die and anorexia for about 2 weeks 3 years ago.

I don’t know how but I somehow developed motion sickness and it’s just ruined my life more. I constantly feel nauseous, I don’t go out, don’t go to college, don’t have a job. I’m honestly a pathetic excuse for a 19 year old. I have no passion, ambitions, or motivation. I’m just existing. I have no hobbies either, I stay in bed 24/7 crying myself to sleep almost every night. All of my friends have jobs, college and are so smart, I’m so so proud of them. And then there’s me, useless, pathetic, dumb and betting my mom wish she stopped at 1 kid. I believe she’s growing tired of me even if she doesn’t show it. I’m just so tired of being like this that death feels like the only way to escape. I wrote a suicide note May 1st so I have that ready in case I actually go through with it. I believe that everyone will be happier if I was just gone. I haven’t been happy in years. I keep wishing that I could go back in time and do things differently but that’s not how things work. I keep trying to resist the urge to hurt myself. A couple of weeks ago, I had a breakdown down. My grandmother came upstairs because I had knocked a small table over in my room and found me just laying on the ground sobbing. My mother didn’t know until weeks later and classified it as a “tantrum” I didn’t argue with her about it because there’s no point. I’ve just been going through the motions, waking up, drinking to, eating noddles or whatever else is in the fridge, going back to my room sleep and repeat. My grandmother constantly makes little gabs at me. She once said “Why don’t you go outside and take pictures with your cousin” I’m ugly as fuck so I told her “I don’t do pictures” she proceeded to say “You don’t do much of anything”. It’s been constant little jabs like that that just hurt and don’t help at all, like I get it grandma, I’m a useless person. She favors my brother and all the men in the family anyways. I try not to let it get to me but it does. I don’t speak about my problems to anyone because I don’t want them to have to deal with my stupid shit. I’m just so tired and want it all to end, one way or another. I just don’t know how much more I can take. I don’t want to breakdown again just for it to be classified as a tantrum.

1mpezq1,Getting divorced and I am spiraling,"I've (30m) been struggling with my ADHD and MDD for years, it's only recently that I've been medicated for it and have been able to make some progress and growth. It has affected my marriage and my ability to communicate clearly with my wife, as well as our banter and sex life. I get brain fog, I get distracted, I can't listen well, I can't focus, I can't comprehend, and according to her I cannot change. Which is true, despite my best efforts and despite the change I truly thought I saw in myself the past year, it doesn't matter.

She wants a divorce, and even though I have made true change to our issues after finally being able to overcome some of the hurdles of my ADHD and depression, it was too little too late. For her, it was what I should've done ages ago and it only took the threat of divorce a month ago for me to finally push myself to take more action and lead our family. Every other time we would talk about our issues, I would try to fix it for a few weeks, then get burnt out from the emotional and mental load of it all or she would reject my advances and I would let my rejection sensitivity slide me even deeper into depression. Every time I would push for couples therapy, she would push back and say we didn't need another person to help solve our issues. And instead of standing my ground, I took her at face value and let it be. I didn't have a spine.

I tried to make us work, I tried to overcome my disabilities, but I couldn't. And now my wife and son suffer for it. I lost myself trying to mold myself into the person she wanted me to be, which I know is unhealthy but I just wanted to be the ideal masculine guy she wanted to be with. In my entire life, I've never once been accepted for being who I am with the exception of my small group of friends. I thought for a long time that she did too, but she would later talk about how she looked down on me because of my hobbies and interests. I did everything to support her interests and her wants, but I tied my self worth to her and I'm only now learning how to recover from that.

I don't want to paint her in a negative light, she is incredibly loving and supportive and kind, but neither of us are perfect and we both have our own issues that we are seeking therapy for. I think I just pushed her to her limit because I couldn't figure my shit out and we couldn't find a common ground to feel fully vulnerable with each other.",1755115386.0,2,1,depression,depression

1mp8vrl,Purple Skies,"Creative writing vent (??) I wrote about my experiences with mental illness, depression, and living through the reality of it. It's a simple and corny metaphor, but one that helps me, and I hope helps others, too.

The sky is purple. It's as clear as day. I look up, and my cone cells see the horizon dominated by purples. I've seen it like this for months. It used to be blue like cotton candy and blueberries and baby boy clothes. The sun used to shine down and warm every atom of my face and down to my neck, letting out an involuntary smile from me. But now it's purple like the galaxy, purple like royalty. The clouds are grey and dark, and the sky's aura is one that hurts my soul. I know why it changed, and I know it's not normal. At least, not normal to me. I know it's not because the heat the blue sky gave warmed my soul like hot cocoa and joy, and these purple ones leave my heart frigid and sad, like a child without candy.

People tell me to shift my mindset, that if I exercise enough, blue will eventually return to my vision. If I fix my body enough, it'll be regulated again. I've had water. I've had exercise. I take walks. I do deep breaths. I do affirmations. I reach out to people. I do everything the pamphlets tell me, and all I get is an occasional blotch of blue, the faintest hints that eventually fade in like watercolor to the rest of the purples, covered up. But hey, time heals? Right? Just a few more days, a few more exercises?

The closest to blue I have is when I take medications. People tell me if I take enough of it, it'll mess up my body, my brain, my mind, my cone cells. My doctors tell me to ignore the fear-mongering, that it'll help the blue come to me, and if it doesn't or if it gets more purple, to call them. I take two of them, and one finally helps the sky be partially blue again. Pills with scary names and labels are the ones that help me see the skies people act like missionaries about to me. It's weird how some wellbeing practices that make no dent in helping me see blue make the sky completely bright blue for others, meanwhile the meds that make me slightly blue makes no impact on others.

Why is defeating my cone cells such a risky, unpredictable hassle?

I know that if medications and other exercises help me to see the sky is blue, that it's actually blue, that there's something up with me as opposed to others. I know that the sky is supposed to be blue, but I can't win against my brain, my vision. I know it's not supposed to be purple, because I do not think the strongest, much more anyone, could have survived in nature if everyone went through nights where the purple sunsets hurt like knives. There are too many people with blue skies for my purple to be normal. I know it's not normal, but so little helps me see otherwise. People tell me to get better, to fight, but get better from what? Is this a flu, a car accident, a sickness?

Is what is so obvious to me a sickness? How could so many tell me that my cone cells are valid for seeing purple skies, but also promote the blue skies so heavily over it. Is my vision not valid, not real? Is the sight of purple the presence of a sickness in my brain? Is that why I get recommended wellness advice, because purple is a symptom that I'm sick? Is that why I get told to love myself to treat the purple skies, because it'll alleviate my illness? Is that why medications help, because the chemicals help me see blue in the ways that ""I reject purple. I see blue. I only want blue skies. I deserve blue skies."" can't? Is my vision really that distorted? 

Are these purple skies that become oh so familar to me sickness that I can't control?

I try to tell myself that one day I will see blue. But how can I imagine warmth and baby blue during the nights when all I have is freezing cold and deep, rich purples? People want me to cling on and have hope during these moments, but 90% of them have never known what it's like to see rich darks surround the clouds in the sky instead of pastel lights. It's hard to truly empathize with those with purple when your skies have only ever been one color. It's impossible to let words have the same impact on my brain as the colors, controlled by hormones that my thoughts can't stop.

People leave when the skies are purple for too long. It leaves an impact on how I act. I wish I could act happy like one of the blues, but the truth is, I can't. I can't see their skies, so I can't act like them. They can't see my skies, so they can't empathize. They all tell me to get better, talk the talk, right before they leave. They get all positive when I don't even want to be here tomorrow to walk the walk. I cling onto what feels like a fantasy: the sky being blue. I barely have anything to make living to see blue worth it. I cling on what feels like incompatibility, trying to live in someone else's reality.

People also tell me that I can do this, I can control this, but I can't. I can tell myself the purple isn't real, but when I look up, I'll still see purple for most of my days and most of the day. I can't control it even when I try. Some people say it's a condition I can control, but I try so hard but most of it doesn't erase the purple. So maybe others are right. It is an illness and a sickness, even if it feels like home to me at this point. The purples are more there to me than the blues are. How can an illness feel so real? Maybe valid is just their way of saying ""What you have is real, but not true."" but appropriately. But how could my cone cells be wrong? Why would my brain work wrong, why would my brain hurt me? Isn't my brain supposed to help me?

So for now, I take the medications to treat the purple. I do the health and wellbeing exercises just to do them. I look straight up at purple skies and tell myself they're blue and I deserve to see blue. I want to try everything to see blue, even if this purple exists to corrode my soul and dissuade me. I try to believe that my perception is valid and my reality is wrong. And if nothing works, then at least I tried everything, right? I talk to friends who see blue and friends who see half purple half blue, who try to tell me it gets better. It helps a lot, to try to find warmth as much as possible under these cold skies.

To be honest, I like it better when people don't tell me to change my colors. They take me as I am. I know they want me to change my perception, but they know I'm too sick to. They know that it's unrealistic for me to see blue soon, even if they desperately want me to. I like it when they accept that tonight, it'll be purple, and it'll hurt. So I like it when they act as my blue. I like it when they keep me afloat in this stormy sea of hopelessness. They hug me, talk to me, and light me up. They treat me not like a purple, but as a blue, and gently divert my eyes from the sky and its pain. I deeply appreciate the way they so kindly treat me and don't alienate me because of my sickness, but instead show me what blue could look like and remind me why I fight. It makes me want to see blue again, and gives my soul the strength to go on to want to see that day when the whole horizon is warm with blues.

One day, I will see blues. Just not today. And that's okay, because I'm not letting the illness of purple skies win over me, even if it feels genuinely impossible today. And that's the best a purple can do ♡",1755101860.0,3,3,depression,depression

Last night he got upset that I wasn’t going to bed at the same time as him because I worked 11 hours and my back hurt (I had spine surgery in February) so I was unwinding. I asked him to please put away the leftovers. He just went upstairs to go to bed but came back out to say, also the  litter box needs to be changed, then he went to bed. He also was drinking so the extra controlling side came out. I silently limped around in pain and just cleaned up and finally went to bed with tears streaming down my face. 2.5 years of being treated badly going through my own stuff while taking care of him. Staying by his side in-spite of no affection or intimacy. People never understand how is for the spouse, everything is about the cancer survivor. People just hear the word cancer and forgive that person for anything without understanding nothing is a good excuse to treat people badly. Sick people don’t always treat others very well. He’s not sick but still, his cancer is being well managed. He’s still active and the cancer is remission and has been so since chemotherapy back since within the first 6 months of his diagnosis. He’s still active hasn’t had too many issues, actually he was still drinking through his chemotherapy. He was still working up until July now he’s retired. So now sometimes he smokes weed instead of drinking but still always something. Which I don’t care I just wish he’d treat me better.

1mp3y5d,I feel stuck in life and want to end it all,"31F here. I've had depression on and off since I was a teen but this year has been the worst. I think I expected my 30s to be better than my 20s, but I've never felt more stuck than I do now.

I am a freelance musician and have dedicated almost my whole life to being a violinist. When I graduated school, COVID-19 hit and I lost all my contracts. I decided to pivot and spent a few summers trying to get pre-requisites for medical school and volunteer experience. When the gigs started coming back (I mostly sub for orchestras) then I sort of put medical school on hold and started freelancing again. I really regret this decision.

Due to the upcoming recession, a lot of orchestras are tightening budgets. I had a good few years, but now I've found myself being left out of work that I had gotten in the past. It feels personal, like I have done something wrong and that's why they don't want me. I have barely anything scheduled for the fall, when last year I was really busy. I have also just been left out of a few gigs that I used to be hired for because someone better came along. It's a tough reality to cope with in this industry. My self worth hinges on the work that I get, and I know it's not healthy. I regret not picking a different area to study. Being a musician means that I work really hard for almost no money and none of it ends up mattering anyway because there's always someone that they decide they want instead. There is no loyalty. No matter how hard I work, it's never enough.

If I leave the industry, I'll feel like a quitter. But I can't imagine doing this for the rest of my life either. I guess it feels even worse now because I'm starting to get to the age where all my friends are getting married and having kids so they don't talk to me anymore. I have a bad relationship with my family and my relationship with my partner is a bit rocky right now. I feel like things should be better because I worked so hard, and they aren't. When I wake up I get hit with a sense of dread, like how can I keep living with this despair day after day. The only thing that's stopping me is that my roommate committed suicide when I was in university and I remember the absolute chaos and sadness it caused for everyone around her, and that I'm scared of it hurting. I haven't decided yet which method to use because they all seem painful and not 100% foolproof.

  
Thank you for listening to my inner thoughts. I know my situation probably isn't that bad but I am feeling worthless and alone. I just hope this feeling passes before I end things but I know it probably wont.",1755090430.0,4,1,depression,depression
1mozl3g,It sucks being depressed but functional,"I have in the past spiralled but for the most part I'm high-functioning. I wash myself if I need to be somewhere, brush my teeth every day, try my best to eat and socialise, show up to work, etc. Yet, my room is a total mess and I feel absolutely no joy or hope in my life. I have constant dread, anxiety, and this heaviness in my soul. When I get home I pretty much just wait for the day to end. 

I feel as though because I'm functional I've been overlooked by a lot of psychiatrists and doctors. I was told that I'm doing well because I'm doing the bare minimum. When I point out to them that I feel like a walking husk, aimlessly stumbling through the world, I am reminded that at least I'm still taking care of myself. I was even once told by a former therapist that adult life isn't what kids think it is, and it's full of mundanity and disappointment. The only mental health professional that hears me is my current therapist. 

I also feel that my feelings are overlooked sometimes because I don't come into the doctor's/psychiatrist's office sobbing or shaking. I'm pretty dissociated from my feelings and, while I can explain them, for the most part they don't show in my body. Maybe because I'm so matter-of-fact about my feelings it's assumed that I'm faking it. 

Honestly, it's so frustrating and exhausting. Why is the marker for good mental health productivity? Why isn't my happiness important? I'm not asking to be euphoric all the time, just to feel okay.

1mpf79j,Depression from insane situation,"Hello all - thought I'd come here to dump my sad story. This is pretty extreme so I'd expect some skepticism. Anyways here it goes. 

Some number of years ago, while an undergrad student living with my parents, I experienced a sudden and profound dissociative fugue. When I eventually recovered and regained my wits, I became suspicious of the people I was living with and after some argumentation agreed to go to the hospital. There I was quickly certified by a psychiatrist and diagnosed with Psychosis NOS. I remained on a psych ward for several weeks before being discharged on extended leave (that is, as an involuntary patient not explicitly confined to a hospital). For several more years I remained in the mental health system, all while continuing to function as an adult (studying and working). Eventually I was discharged completely, however more recently it has come to my attention that footage containing myself featuring extreme abuse has been circulating, likely disseminated for monetary gain. A number of other people (co-workers, acquaintances) who have gained some knowledge of my situation have made more or less subtle comments concerning military torture techniques, such as might be used to break a person's will and compel them to commit degrading acts. Others have expressed shock or various other reactions upon (I am assuming) seeing the footage or becoming aware of its existence, however I have not engaged with them regarding this topic. Several have even specifically referenced Kafkaesque situations involving maddeningly complex bureaucratic corruption and the dystopian film *Brazil* (where the protagonist is eventually tortured to insanity). 

In short, I was likely drugged, forced to undergo some form of psychological torture, and then filmed while being abused in a state of enhanced suggestibility or weakened resistance. My initial interaction with *some* of the nurses and doctors in the mental health system leads me to believe that they deliberately misdiagnosed me as an attempt to gaslight and formally discredit me. To top it off, this abuse was perpetrated by my own parents (I am their only child) who managed to dupe most of my other lifetime friends and associates into believing that this was somehow justified as a punitive measure for my bad behavior (which didn't actually exist); the core motivation being monetization of the footage. 

An even more horrific second point: I have also noticed that some of my social media feeds seems to be artificially saturated with disturbing content. I am aware that such feeds will naturally mold themselves around one's digital footprint, however the degree of saturation does not seem commensurate with the degree to which I have searched the relevant themes or topics, these being: powerlessness, torture, abuse, humiliation, corrupt authority figures abusing their power, and some even more specific, such as entrapped/powerless victims attempting to make covert appeals to strangers for aid. I have documented some of these if you would like to see for yourself - as a rough estimate, I'd say that %60-%70 of the content of the relevant feeds have been affected in this manner for the past 8-12 months since it's caught my attention. This could just be coincidental though.

So needless to say I'm pretty bummed out about this. I realize this might sound like an actual schizophrenic delusion to most people, and if anyone wants to question me a bit further I could probably convince you I'm not insane. That being said, the main point of posting this here is to solicit support for the psychological aftermath, so if you want to just take my story for granted and help with that that'd be fine too.",1755115857.0,1,0,depression,depression

1mp4hkc,I can't deal with all this death and suffering around me,"I'm 18. There seems to be so much death and suffering around me and I don't know how to cope with it other than this. I can't tell anyone else, they're having a hard enough time as it is.

My granddad on my mums died at the start of the year. His health had been in decline for a year or 2. Some form of rare aggressive cancer in the end. He was old for the country in which he was born and lived, lived through some quite horrible times. He wasn't that old compared to standards in this country. I went to see him with my mum in December (abroad, so that complicates things) - I sort of wish I hadn't. His brain was fine, he was still fighting, but his body was clearly not in any good way. Because of cultural reasons and his wishes, he was being cared for at home by his daughter (my mum's sister). He was bloated, constant hiccups and other sounds that I don't know how to describe other than if I heard them from a person, I would assume death was soon. When he died, my mum was there, and the rest of my family and I went for the funeral. Buried in a place with a great view of a ridge line of a mountain range that I'm well familiar with.

My mum suffered two miscarriages many many years ago. First she had my brother (now 25), then two miscarriages, then me. They both had to die for me to exist. How the hell am I supposed to deal with that. My dad decided that their shared gravestone would have the top cut with that same ridge line, now visible from my granddad's grave (of course, thats coincidence). So now I look out from my granddad's view onto this ridge, and cannot help but associate it with ""I wouldn't exist if they hadn't died"". Yet I feel absolutely no attachment or wonder about these siblings. I used to join my mum when she went to the cemetery but I haven't been in a while. She usually cried but I don't know if the pain is fading yet. All I did while she was crying was try to comfort her and wonder why I felt no attachment and was visiting 2 peoples graves who I'd never known.

My grandmother on my mums side is currently in the process of dying. She wasn't handling the slow death of her husband (of like a huge number of years) well. I don't know what she's got, but her memory is gone - she doesn't really know who my mum is, or who I am, but she seems to remember that we were once at least important to her. She was being cared for at home (abroad, again by her daughter, my mum's sister) in her deteriorating state. Again, on my granddad's wishes, she was not to be put in a home. I don't know why my mum and her sister decided to respect that after he died. My grandmother took a knife that she had hidden somewhere after the rest of the knives were removed (supposedly) and cut up some furniture, apparently attempting to protect my mum's sister's daughter's daughter (age something like 5) who lives in the same house. My mum's sister had to call the police because what else do you do in that case. So she was removed to a mental hospital, then has recently been released to some old peoples care home, which, if you're thinking like one in the UK or somewhere, is not. There's 3 elderly people all in one not great room, minimal carers. But whatever, it's what's expected in that country. She's lost her mind and she's basically now just skin draped over some bones. My mum's sister visits her everyday, as does my mum when she's there.

My mum has suffered though this of course. But because they're abroad, there's of course the consideration that whenever she sees them might be the last. So she's constantly travelling back and forth. When she's here, she has at least two (loud video) calls a day, usually 45 mins long each, with her sister, plus maybe one every few days with her sister's daughter. The phone calls usually are her sister reporting my grandmothers condition and deterioration. Of course they are usually emotional. Often this interrupts whatever little family time we're having, often meals. She never asks before but sometimes apologisies after, and I never say anything. It's not ok.  This makes it feel like whenever she's here, she's not really. I tried to tell her this isnt good for her mental health, but of course, its more nuanced than that and that means we have fallen out over this. But it means she's bringing all the death and suffering into this house, or leaving to be abroad, meaning no stability. It's also ruined one holiday: we had planned to take some time out in the same country abroad, just the 4 of us to escape - my mum didn't go because my granddad supposedly wouldn't make it a week and she wanted to be there for him. It took another 7 months for him to die. I know that things like that can't be estimated, and I don't blame her for wanting to be near her dad. But we had gone through years of ups and downs at this point, at least 2 death scares a year. And still my mum rides the ups and downs and reacts impulsively. But I don't blame her. A recent holiday (a rare one not to the same country abroad) was in jeopardy because my grandmother might not have survived the week. Again, she did. But I don't know what I would do if I was in my mum's position.

My grandmother on my dad's side died a few years back. I don't really remember her in any good condition. Diabetes and brain troubles towards the end. Took her about 8 years or so to die. Spent a large number in multiple care homes, and more being cared for at home by my grandad on my dad's side.

My other grandad has just been diagnosed with something weak heart. Which is normal for aging. But he's doing alright so far at least, although his sight and hearing is declining. 

Someone else in my family on my dad's side that I had never met died the other day. In hospital. Don't know the full story, but he had been alone and refused pretty much any social interaction for many years. So died with no close relatives, no comfort. Already my parents are talking about some kind of problems with his will.

I work at a fast food place. There was a guy there in kitchen that I never really talked to much (language barrier), but we always said hello to each other whenever we saw each other. Nice guy. I came in one evening not long ago for work. He had died unexpectedly the previous evening (I think at home, maybe in his sleep). Not nice, but it happens. Had an assembly at my school a few days later where they give out awards to people. Called a name out for a girl who was in year 10. Didn't show up. Saw her name on the screen. Same surname. Very unique surname as well. Her dad died while working 6 years in a boring meaningless job just to try and support her and maybe trying to save for some time in the future with her. Never got it. I mean you hear all the time that you should enjoy life and not take it for granted. But in reality everybody does take it for granted - we have to work. Some people have to work more than others and get nothing from life in return. Yet I'm still working there, not often socialising because I struggle in those situations. 

On holiday a couple years ago to see the family abroad for one week. Left our cat with my brother at our house (he hadn't moved out by that point), because he didn't come. He died the morning on the day we got back, just before we got back. Not sure what happened, maybe clipped by car, maybe a heart attack, but he was not injured. Found by a neighbour who initially tried to take him to our house, but my brother didn't hear the door, so he took him to the vet. My mum got that phone call while we were travelling back. 

And now my mum's talking about moving back abroad when she gets a bit older. And I'll be having to make these same decisions to stay or go when she inevitably gets ill (assuming she doesn't die soon). 

My grandad died of a cancer that might be genetically passed down to my mum, me and my brother. Who knows what that'll come to, but that's not nice to find out - and im not sure my parents are aware that im aware. I think they told my brother but didn't realise I could hear.

At the same time, I'm struggling to have any self esteem to socialise. I guess that this and due to other circumstances. When it comes up in conversation rarely with my mum, and things being implied so it's a bit difficult to reproduce any conversation here. But basically, I talk about a girlfriend, which I dont have. Yet repeatedly my mum always responds with ""... or a guy, I don't mind"". I'm straight. I don't know why she feels the need to say its ok if I'm gay. I've said I'm straight, I have always been straight. I assumed it was just my mum trying to be weirdly accommodating. But then I was at another family gathering on my dad's side, which I tried to avoid but was forced to attend. I don't remember how it came up, but it was going down a similar path, and my dad's brother's daughter said ""... or guy"". Do I come off as gay? Is it because I don't have a girlfriend yet? Why are people being overly accommodating when I'm never mentioning being gay?

I don't know how to handle this. When I was visiting my mum's mum in the care home, another of my mum's sister's daughter's asked me if I had seen was scary. I said it wasn't. It wasn't. I have been exposed to this too much now that suffering before death seems normal and learning someone has died is relieving. Or makes me question why we accept living in this way. Yet we'll all still accept it. Is it normal to exposed to this at age like 13?

If anyone from my family finds this, if anyone then my brother (who's avoided the worst of it by moving out and having a girlfriend and full time job), then I guess it's all out. But I don't know if that would make things easier or not?",1755091745.0,3,0,depression,depression

1mp2ntq,i'm lost and can't destinguish reality from the dream,"i have been living with depression for over 8 years now. it started when i was 11 with a sudden death of my beloved cat, who was the only creature i felt safe with. living in a constant loneliness and silence this cat was the only thing that gave a sense of joy, love and company. he was like a child to me, the younger brother who i wanted to protect from everything no matter what. but he died of cancer and with him died my ability to hope for the better, to develop a loving and happy relationship. the second thing that fell down on me was the realization of my homosexuality that lead me to abandon myself and create a new personality in a fear of my true self's disclosure. after these two accidents i was never the same and still trying to deal with these traumas today. all these years before 2022 i had been living in isolation and battling asthenia that fell upon me after the first depressive episode at 11. i couldn't think, i couldn't read and couldn't concentrate on anything but what a failure a became and the dissociation from my body that made me a husk of a person i once was.,

 i'm ukrainian, so i left the country after the war broke out and a month before the war my mental state had begun to worthen. first panick attacks and the constant feeling that i was going to die shortly. this state really bloomed when i became a refugee in europe where my second depressive episode truly began. every day, every minute i had the thoughts that i needed to die because i regarded my self as misery of my family and a worthless creature that didn't deserve a life. at this time i started going to therapy and got diagnosed with depressive personality disorder. i started taking sertralin and this a year went by. then i found a different psychiatrist and with her help i sarted a new course of quetiapin and carbomazepin, because i had seizures and hallucinations quite often, now living in germany as a refugee. still very isolated with my family who abused me and blamed me for their problems. around this time i started to drink alcohol, while being on a high amount of pills and got addicted to alcohol to drink away the loneliness and abuse inflicted on me. a had a suicide attempt around that time. a year ago i went to czech republic to study english philology at the uni. this education and time spent studying for this were one of the britest moments in my life but unfortunately there is a chance of me being deported because of me assisting the money laundering. see, i have become a victim of a scammer on the internet who used my bank account to launder crypto money. he stole around 5k euros and when i went to the police they started to suspect me of assistance. while the prosecution is going on, i'm ok but if they accuse me, i have a chance of going to prison up to one year and deportation. the most heavy thing for me is that this whole sutation could influence my studying, the thing for what i worked so hard is about to be taken from me and it's very hard for me to comprehend the shit i have got into. this whole situation felt like anouther dream i had at night where som eof my relatives died or i've been exposed or laughed at. but it was real.

They only know a part of what he's going through). This morning he told me that he's not sure if he feels love for me anymore because of his depression, and also that he had a dream where he told me things he ""doesn't really like (about me)"" but won't tell me what they are because he doesn't want me to have to change.. but that's side tracking a bit. I told him I would be there to support him no matter what and that we could take a break or do whatever he needs right now with our relationship (to which he just said act how we normally do), I have sent him ""self esteem journals"" and therapy type worksheets but I'm not sure how often he really does them.. I've even gone as far as to introduce more niche types of therapy like age regression but that took too much effort for him to get into despite it seeming to help once or twice. How else can I help him? Will his love ever come back or should I accept it and just support him as a friend?

1mp6rgt,I've been craving self-harm for over a year,"TW: Self harm, if that wasn't already clear

I've already done it once in 2022, but my scars are so thin and light that even I can barely make them out from my skin. I don't want that, I want more. I've had the idea of doing it again floating about in my mind every moment since then, but as of the last maybe year and a half, it's become more of a craving rather than just something I'd like to do. I can't imagine my body not being covered in scars, from the chest, to the thighs, to the arms and sometimes even the face. I don't realize these fantasies because I hate to see my parents crying or asking if they can do anything to help. I'm not even meaning this as a means to get help, let alone to kill myself, it's just my body and I want it to look like that, same way you can cut your hair, get plastic surgery or go to the gym. I've recently come to realize that even I find them attractive even in other people. Someone with these marks, they've struggled as I do, maybe even more, and that's hot. They're real. I want to be real too. I want people to see me, and to not just think I'm a coward who can't handle feelings when ""Everyone feels that way"". I want people to be able to clearly see this, so that people who are down can find me like a light amidst a thick veil of mist and know I won't judge or hurt them like everyone else seems hell-bent in doing. Call it what you will, but I see these scars as reassuring, they tell the tale of despair that so many wouldn't notice otherwise, and tell me that you're approachable, because you, at the very least, have seen the world through the same lens I do. The only time I've felt comfortable in so long was amidst people who were down in the gutter, and I want those people to find me again, regardless of what everyone else might think of me.",1755097068.0,1,1,depression,depression

I used to be an A* student till my o levels but fked up my a levels due to my family issues and how they're always fighting and did not give me any freedom.I ended up getting a C E E. And these were my grades after multiple retakes. I initially got Bs in my AS. As these werent acceptable to my parents I ended up retaking and getting even lower grades. This kept going on until i ended up at an E. Tuesday was a nightmare. I wasn't expecting these grades, but it was okay since law here only required you to pass a levels.  My dad decided to take my life long dream of studying international law away from me. He told me he cannot spend so much money on ""law"" because it doesn't have any scope in our country. He is forcing me into studying for private medical college because spending so much on that would ""make sense""(he only listens to his backward friends, it was their idea). Acc to him there's no scope in uk law but there is scope in the national law. Hes forcing me to consider the lowest university which is societally considered ""where failures go"" i even proposed i do national law from a well reputed university and he said NO. He did all of this just because that lowly university is ""only girls"".

1mp69kj,Precept #1,"These circumstances cannot just remain a trauma in my life. If I don't learn from them, they will happen again. Hence, I am starting 'Precepts', inspired from Zote the Mighty, to record my learning from the worst experiences, and maybe help others here in the process. 

Precept #1 - Don't take any major decisions during moments of weakness.

My biggest mistake and regret of all this is that I took a decision while being at my lowest. Many things seem reasonable and rational in such moments of weakness. However, with time you will get over it. You will return to your normal self. And your normal self will hate the decision you took while being your lowest. You will feel stupid, immature, and childish, and you will regret your actions to your heart. You will start hating yourself. You can try fixing it, but what is done is done. 

So wait. Wait to return to your normal self. Wait to be able to think normally again. Take your time, Take your moment. But wait.

1mox9kj,How can I help my wife through depression?,"My(35F) wife(29F) is dealing with some politically related depression. She says she’s tired of getting online everyday to see some new bs going on. Today she saw that a request was submitted for the Supreme Court to reconsider same sex marriage and it seemingly pushed her over the edge. We talked about it briefly this morning and I basically said that I didn’t understand why her feelings on political things would affect her view of everything. She seemed to take it as me saying she should just put on a fake happy face and pretend nothing is going on. She said she’s basically scared of the world. She hates that we have to worry about conflict everywhere we go and that we could potentially lose our rights. 

We talked about it again tonight and it felt like we were talking in circles. I acknowledged her feelings and reiterated that I didn’t think it should make her not enjoy anything and that I didn’t think it was fair that she was frustrated with me for asking her about it again. I told her I loved her and I’m just trying to get some understanding and find out how I can help and she said she appreciated me trying but nothing else. She then said she was going to sleep on the couch because it’s hot(we only have AC in the living room and are in a heat wave) and she’s tired and she just wants to be alone. I respect that and am staying in our room but I’m sad and feel like a failure for not knowing the right things to say or do to help make her feel better.

She also refuses to seek any professional help or medication. She's also refusing to contact her parents as they're the main reason why she ended up this way, and she lives alone.

My mother told me about him talking about only living for 2 more days, and I completely brushed it off, because he was talking things like that for years. After that I spoke with my brother on the telephone and he sounded sad, I think he was crying a little bit. I was asking him questions about how he feels, he told me he is feeling like he doesn't want to do anything and that nothing makes him happy. I asked him if he was depressed and he sad no. I than asked him to go to holidays with me, which he refused. I asked if there is anything I could do for him. But besides that I didnt offer any comfort, I didnt feel his pain. It was like I was for some reason mad at him. I ended the conversation after 11 minutes, because I didnt feel like talking to him. I was distant and cold. He had an doctors appointment a couple of hours later and I told him to tell the doctor about his feelings (that nothing makes him happy). I wasn't really concerned. For me it was just one of the many problems he had, we talked about them and it was later OK. I had a feeling that he might be depressed, I thought that this is something we still have a lot of time to solve. It didn't accour to me, that he might be suicidal for one second. I couldn't imagine that something like what happend, could happen in a million years. Later in the afternoon I was thinking that I have to call him and ask him how did the doctors appointment go, but when I remembered in the evening, it was already to late.

I feel guilty about not taking him talking about 2 more days, seriously. I feel guilty about thinking that everything will be alright and that it didnt occour to me that he might me suicidal. I feel guility that I was a bitch in the conversation. And I feel guilty about forgetting to call him.

1mp332d,Residential Treatment,"I've lived with depression for over a decade. After an intense month, I went to the ER with SI and ended up on a behavioral unit for 6 days. It was unpleasant. It kept me safe but was stressful instead of therapeutic. 

Now my doctor is recommending 30 days inpatient at a residential facility. I'm assuming it will be better than what I experienced at the local hospital, but I don't know. 

I'm so conflicted on what to do. I have two young kids that it would be very hard to leave but a very supportive partner who is encouraging me to get the help. I would have to take a leave of absence from work, but it's doable. The facility I'm looking at is called Pathlight. I just don't know what to do.

1mowgpe,I’ve never felt supported and it’s making me bitter,"My thoughts are a jumble of a mess right now because it’s 2am and I’m crying but I just have to get this off my chest because there’s really no one in my life I feel safe talking too.

I’ve been writing a book lately with the intention to publish after writing in my free time for almost 20 years. It’s a plot I’m very proud of, but the lack of interest from my friends and family is kind of disheartening. I have one friend who said she loves my idea and even asked to read what I have, which I’ve given her access to, but it’s been months and she hasn’t read it yet. I know people are busy but I’m really excited about this… but it seems like no one cares. No one asks me how it’s going or anything. In fact I feel like when I bring it up, I just get silence. It hurts. There are times where I look at my rough drafts and wonder what’s the point. If I can’t get my friends to care, how will I get strangers to care? It makes me want to just quit all together.

Maybe it just hurts because I’ve been in situations where other friends take on projects that excite them and I get super excited for them too! I’ve offered to help where I can, I’ve surprised them with materials to help their artwork along, I consistently do things for friends that I don’t seem to get in return and it hurts. Maybe it’s me. Maybe I just care too much. Maybe it’s not normal to remember your friend’s birthdays without them having to remind people a week in advance or that one thing they keep saying they need to make their life easier that would be a perfect thoughtful gift.

I struggle with if I care too much and people just don’t value the relationship like I do, or if they just don’t care enough. It sucks that I can’t gauge what’s normal because I just don’t know anymore. I have all my friends birthdays, addresses, and wish lists saved in my phone. But every year I can barely get a *late happy birthday let alone an on time one. I feel so stupid and forgettable. I get so jealous when my other friend’s friends share these photos of them on their stories wishing them a happy birthday when someone I considered my best friend didn’t even remember mine.

Some days I feel like I should just cut everyone out and just start over. At least if I didn’t have friends then there would be an excuse why no one celebrates my achievements. 

I’ve never felt loved outside the neurologically engraved love between me and my parents. I’ve never dated (29f), never had anyone choose me or prioritize me, I can’t even get my friends to give a shit let alone a boyfriend. I think I’m somewhat pretty, I have a unique style, I’m hilarious, I have a good heart, my personality is a little shy from years of rejection but it’s still good… so I’m confused why purpose is finding its place with everyone but me. Am I really that bad? I never thought of myself as a bad person but what’s wrong with me that I don’t know? Why don’t I stick out to people? Why don’t I matter? Why can’t people support me everyonce and a while for a change. 

Sorry this is all over the place. It’s late and I’m so hurt and tired and have no one to talk to. ",1755064806.0,3,1,depression,depression
1mp2bxt,Vent: How depression is kicking my arse right now,"Depression really is just kicking my arse and I’m drowning in the misery.

It feels like every effort I put into making my life a little easier, blows up in my face. Sometimes (frequently) the person blowing it up and making my life worse is me. The second I think someone in public is intentionally doing something to make me uncomfortable or get a rise out of me, I freak out. I’m getting better and I’m recognising that it’s largely coming from the shitty way my sister treats me. And the fact that if I have any negative emotions or I need her, she becomes belligerent and I’m this bottled up time bomb that goes off the second I feel “safer” than I do with my sister. If I get upset with her directly, she gets even more upset and basically melts down. So I have to ignore how I’m feeling and prioritise her feelings.

Following her most recent hospital stay over 12 months ago, I keep hoping that maybe she’ll start getting better. But she doesn’t. She fell back into her old habits almost immediately, she won’t find a new psychologist, she won’t fix her eating, leave the house or lose weight.

I want to move away from my sister so, so much. In the last two years she’s grown so controlling and so obsessive that I can barely do anything freely in the house without it crossing some sort of routine and making her evening more complicated. I miss my old life before living with her. I miss it so much. But I don’t have any interest in returning to share housing with strangers, either. It’s so stressful and the housemates I choose, we end up hating each other so quickly.

The dream is to afford the absolutely ridiculous rental prices and live on my own. Not to get all Disney Princess on y’all, but I want it so much. The privacy, the freedom and the simplicity. I feel so trapped and overwhelmed by my current situation. The only thing keeping me here is her cat. The feeding regime for the cat is so extreme that, given her history of abusing her cat, I know she’d do horrible things to her cat if she had to do it on her own. I follow the extreme regime because her cat _does_ throw-up less. And since I’m responsible for cleaning the vomit out of the carpet and I have psoriatic arthritis, I’ll do what I must.

However, it’s EXTREME. 4.5 hours if she, the kitteh, doesn’t vomit. Twice a day, for a total of 9 hours feeding the cat per day. I never get to go anywhere in the mornings on the weekends because I’m feeding the cat. My sister sleeps up to 13 hours and is a night owl. She keeps me up late and if I want to leave the house before 11am, I have to get up at 6am. With my poor health, I have to sleep as much as I can so it’s just not realistic to do that.

I now hate the idea of having a pet of my own one day. And it was a thing I so looked forward to and had planned out. Currently, I’m only staying with my sister until the cat dies and I will not be adopting a cat, ever. Sometimes I’m a monster and I hope the cat dies of natural causes soon so my life gets easier (she’s between 12-15 years old). But I also find that me dying also sounds like a viable way to get out of this misery, too.

I blame the stress and misery of living with her for triggering all the autoimmune stuff that’s popped up since moving in with her. The house is riddled with mould, too, and getting her to agree to try moving to another property is an ordeal.

It would be nice if I can survive long enough to get out of this, but I’m not sure how much longer my mind and body can hang on.",1755086012.0,1,0,depression,depression

I have actually not been okay for about 13 years, but it got worse in 2020, and I feel pathetic, mostly. So much happened, so much changed but it has been years and I should already be over it. I am not... why?  I feel I was on track to be okay in 2019, slowly getting better. Then chaos, got isolated, searched for connection in the wrong place, trusted the wrong people ,lost the love of my life over this damned mental sickness, and I gave up too soon, graduated late and alone, then I got into an abusive relationship and got myself rped. Fun times overall. I can´t stop blaming myself for everything.  I´ve tried 5 therapists so far, but it feels fake; therapy is supposed to be good and helps a ton of people, but it just is not helping me. The things everyone tells me are supposed to help are not; they are mere distractions, only moments, and that is frustrating because I am now realizing that moments are all I can do, all I can get, but it always comes back. A sickness without a cure. I feel fundamentally broken.  This past 2-3 weeks, I have really felt myself losing it. I break into uncontrollable sobbing at random times. I can´t go outside my room for fear of someone seeing how crazy I am acting. As suddenly as I start crying, it stops, and I feel like I´m in a bad video game, staring at nothing, unable to move the controls. Everything feels far away, and I´m in my body, but I´m not. I don´t know how much more I have in me anymore. I´ve held myself together on my own for so many years. And I´m getting way too tired to keep it up. So now I´m here, in this subreddit, venting to strangers because I am scared. Scared to reveal what I actually am to those close to me, frustrated because the one person I talk to about these things just can´t get it, and I can feel whatever is left of that relationship erode, and just desperate to make everything stop.

so i tried to kill myself. i got to a point in my life to where i felt that was the best route to go in order to “fix” my problems. i was thankfully found by the police and taken to a mental institution and kept there for a week. when i was there it wasn’t necessarily bad but its not really a place you would want to be obviously. i had no contact with the outside world. so with me being there i noticed that the negative thoughts went away i didn’t have to deal with anything other than working on myself. which was something i needed obviously. and i know i definitely had an effect on the people in my life bc obviously thats not something they wanted to happen, they were just happy i was alive. for the first time in my life with dealing with depression i actually felt loved and cared for. but also in my head i thought “why did i have to get to this point for people to care?” i have vocalized my issues plenty of times and asked for help but basically got the cold shoulder. so when i disappeared for all that time people decided to be more active in my life so that i don’t feel that way. but now being out for 2 days i feel that im falling back into my old ways. i’ve been super depressed/crying/feeling alone. n it feels like now that im out of the hospital people don’t have the same energy from when i was in there. so its like how am i supposed to feel now? i dont feel like im a risk to myself right now but its like what if the depression gets so bad that i will be again? i’ve tried talking to therapists and even suicide hotlines but it just seems to heal the pain temporarily. i just want to be happy. when im super down it makes me feel like the people i have don’t reach out because im depressed. because they don’t know how to deal with it or just don’t want to. but i have nobody else. i don’t really have family or that many friends. i try to get out but it seems like i just end up driving around aimlessly wondering what the next step is for me. i’m really trying to do better and make something of my life but the depression makes it really really hard. i know people say “try medication” it’s not something im opposed to but it’s also not something i want to depend on to be happy. idk what to do",1755055665.0,4,3,depression,depression
1mos6pr,36 and losing it,"My 30s has been just a big mess. First we all went through Covid, I was so depressed then, but I thought maybe someday things would get better. Something told me in 2020 that it never would.

I feel like I’m missing out on all kinds of experiences, but not interested in going it alone. I’m not getting married and can’t afford kids. So there’s no real place for me in society anymore.

Then my mother got early onset Alzheimers, devastating and horrific, something I was always terrified of and here it is. In my 30s! Whole everyone else’s parents are fine and babysitting.

This is mostly for myself so I can better understand myself by jotting my thoughts down. I would still appreciate input if you feel the same, or have any input at all.

Meat and potato:
I don't really know if I'm depressed or wtv. I was diagnosed twice, but the therapists here all are utter shite (in my country.) So I'm not exactly sad, I don't know if I can even feel that. It feels like I started emulating emotions when I was very young. I would guess that I picked up different ways to describe a feeling or facial expressions after certain events, but never actually got those feelings. It's definitely hard to put into words, it's sort of like asking a blind person what vision sounds like. I just feel… okay? Some ""traumatic"" events happened in my life, and I don't know if they never affected me, or I just didn't allow them to by suppressing my emotions (I was very young). To this day I just cannot imagine the first ""traumatic"" event ever having an effect on me. Any way… this is neither here nor there.

I'd describe myself when I'm in a depressive episode as lazy, chill, demotivated, and just existing, until it lifts off of me. I'm not sad, but I'm not happy either. It sucks because I want to be sad. I want to be disappointed in myself so I can do something about it (if that's even the antidote), and I want to care about my health and future, but somehow a week passes without me leaving my room every other week and it's just routine for me. I sometimes get long periods in which I can actually do whatever I have to; Go to classes, shower, pee, eat, socialize. But when I cycle back to this condition, I would hold my bladder up to over 24 hours, eat once a day (since I only need to move once to grab my postmates/ubereats order), Not drink water for converningly long periods, not shower (and I'm a clean freak and germophobe), and even stop talking to the people I love for as long as I can without having it be a problem.

I suck at writing but I have one more thing to add: One of the reasons I think I emulate feelings as opposed to what I would guess people actually feel (though it could be the same thing but I'm being far too introspective), is that when I'm put in a sad, happy, angry… wtv situation, I'll often hear my thoughts telling me to stand in a way, fix my face, and make a noise or comment to reflect that feeling. It does not come naturally to me, and I often feel drained after hanging out with friends after ""emulating"" feelings and emotions for anything over an hour. Whether it's happiness, anger, disappointment, sadness… The minute I leave them is the minute I go back to my natural state of numbness. Nothing can fuck me up or linger for more than the time it takes to walk out of sights. And writing this now has made me ask myself: Is this why I rot in my bed for days on end? because I feel like that's when the FeelingsOS shutsdown, and I can finally let the engines cool down? Maybe that's all of us, but I can't shake down the feeling that I have no feelings, and it's all a program emulating what I see around me.


Sorry for the paragYAP.

1. mom
pros: she cares abt me and can give me access to doctors, therapy, or meds
cons: she wouldn’t understand or believe it’s that serious, could weaponize my feelings against me, and would tell other people
2. friend group
pros: they’re the ppl i’m super close with. friend A has experience with helping friends with mental struggles. i think friend B also has depression so we could relate to each other and vent freely. friend C is very supportive.
cons: i could tell one of them separately but i feel like if i want to say something i should tell the whole group. this is also an important school year for us so i don’t want to put an extra burden on them. our friendship is about fun and i don’t know if i want to take the next step and tell them abt my struggles.
3. friend D
pros: they’ve told me a lot of personal things so we’re close and they would probably listen to my struggles as well and relate to them. they’re so sweet and i would def feel safe pouring out my heart to them
cons: they’re struggling a lot and i don’t want to put extra stress on them. they’re so busy with responsibilities and a tough family life and i don’t feel right dumping my troubles onto them
4. online
pros: it’s anonymous and feels the safest space to talk into. also people have to choice to help me out so they’re willingly giving time to help out 
cons: idk if should i talk to one person or talk in support groups/communities? and where should i find these ppl/groups? is there someone committed enough to check up on me to make sure i’m on track w routines? 

or is it a process that i can actually get through myself with patience and slow steps?

people will suggest therapy, as if i even have the energy to seek out a therapist. i just want someone to hold my hand and do everything for me, as selfish as that is. i don’t know what to do about all of these feelings.. i need help but i don’t know where to find it.

1mozrvd,How do I support my guarded friend while struggling with my own depression?,"My friend has been hurt and disappointed by many people before, so she learned to protect her heart and not get too attached easily. When we first became close, I was there for her through a lot of her healing. I gave her my time, my care, and my consistency, and she would sometimes tell me, “I hope I can be a good friend for you,” because deep down she feared losing people again. Over time, I saw her open up and trust me more, and it felt special to be someone she could count on.

Now, the roles have shifted. I’m the one struggling with depression, feeling emotionally drained, and needing more support. She tries in her own way to be there, but sometimes it feels like she pulls back before getting too close, maybe because she’s scared of going through the same pain she’s experienced before. It’s hard for me, because I’ve always been the one giving without hesitation, and now that I’m the one in need, I feel the gap more than ever.

Everything is an opportunity, empathy is an afterthought at best. Even those self proclaiming themselves the epitome of empathetic behavior still tend only to extend that empathy to those they feel worthy which is mostly people just like them. Even the dating dynamic is parasitic in nature and the idea of a fully equal relationship is abhorrent to most individuals. 

How can I possibly reconcile human nature so I can be around people and not feel completely alone? Seriously I'm actually looking for ideas. I tend to stand alone at all times. In rationality, in morality, in ethics, and many other areas. I never have encountered anyone else like me anywhere ever, not even online. Church folks talk a good game but at the end it's just a bunch of apologizing for things they have no intentions of stopping and they confuse societal or employment rewards with ""God's favor"" and while they may be the most moral out here they're also the most irrational and honestly no fun.

1mogmxp,DEPRESSION SPLINTERS: Finding the Hidden Causes of Your Pain,"  
I decided to write a brief guide of reflections from my own journey overcoming depression. For a long time, I thought it was impossible. I was told it was just who I was. So why even try? But I’m here to tell you it doesn’t have to be that way.

Depression signals that something in your life is out of balance. Like the sting of a splinter, the pain isn’t the problem, it’s the message.

The challenge is that splinters often hide, quietly and beneath the surface. They can be buried in childhood neglect, in the unseen toll of chronic overwork, in years of unspoken grief, in the slow erosion of health, or in the daily small compromises you’ve learned to overlook. Some are obvious. Others are so deeply woven into your identity that you mistake them for who you are.

How do you begin when you don’t know what the problem is?

The first step is simply to slow down and pay attention. Begin to notice these things. Turn your attention inward without judgement or fear. Healing begins by asking yourself honest questions about your body, yo8ur mind, your relationships, and your daily choices. These questions aren’t about quick fixes or positive thinking. They are a means to an end; tools in the psychological landscape of growth. They will help you find and remove the splinters so that you can heal.

**Opening to What Shapes Me**

* Where am I letting others control the direction of my life without realizing it?
* What unseen currents of rhythms around me am I resisting, and how might that resistance be holding me back?
* Where am I moving through life on autopilot rather than with mindful purpose?
* Where am I revealing too much of my inner life to people who don’t deserve that access?
* If I treated my energy and attention as currency, where am I wasting it?

**What Lights My Way**

* If all the walls I’ve built vanished, what would my true path look like?
* What purpose compels me to begin each day, and is it enough to endure the challenges ahead?
* Who are the five minds I allow to shape my own, and do their values align with mind to guide me toward what I seek?
* Where have I stopped in the face of obstacles instead of finding a way to adapt and move forward?
* If I believed success was guaranteed, what bold step would I take today?

**Listening to My Body**

* Which feelings in my body do I turn away from because they awaken discomfort or pain?
* What recurring physical symptoms might be signals of unresolved stress or trauma?
* In what ways am I repeating the pain of old wounds instead of facing and healing their root?
* Which habits bring me temporary relief but deepen my pain over time?
* How might I return to my body with kindness and let myself feel without fleeing?

**Embracing the Present Moment**

* What am I clinging to that only exists in memory?
* In what ways am I struggling against the current instead of flowing with the river of life?a
* How much of my unhappiness comes from comparing my life to an imagined version of it?
* Where can I surrender the need for control and simply dance with the unfolding of life?
* If I embraced uncertainty fully, how would it reshape my decisions?

**Walking with Purpose**

* What problem in my life is worth the pain it requires to solve?
* Which expectations am I holding that are often lead to disappointment?
* Where am I avoiding responsibility by blaming external forces?
* Which values guide my actions, and do they lead to a life worth living?
* What am I prepared to fail at again and again because its pursuit is vital?

**Holding On and Letting Go**

* Who or what do I depend for happiness, and is that dependence real?
* What would it feel like to love without expecting anything back?
* Where am I holding on too tightly instead of seeking to understand?
* Which fears are making me cling to situations or people that are harmful?
* How often am I present with what is, versus lost in what I want it to be?

**How to Use These Questions for Deep Growth:**

* Each day, choose 2 to 3 questions that resonate with you and write your answers honestly, without censoring or judging yourself.
* Return to the same questions every month. You’ll likely find your answers evolving as you grow and uncover new insights.
* Pay close attention to patters. When certain themes or answers repeat, they reveal patterns in your experience. These are areas where your healing energy is most needed.",1755023071.0,11,2,depression,depression

I used to work out regularly for example, and i used to be very fit, but now i don't care anymore.

No i wont kill myself, in my work i meet suicidal people and their family and friends, and i know i will just make everything worse for them if i do it. But for how long can i think like this? Sometimes i feel like my death will be of suicide, its just a matter of how long i can hold on. 

To summarize in a poem: why eat something that is good, when it will leave a bitter taste in my mouth and i will be sick?

1monczb,Therapy isn't helping and I don't know what to do,"I (19m) started going to therapy a few months ago for issues relating to depression, anxiety, and social issues.  I have been very unhappy for over six years and still am.  This is my first time in any sort of mental health treatment and I usually keep all my problems to myself so this is all very new and uncomfortable for me.  The problem is that I feel like going to therapy has become a source of stress in my life.  I have a really hard time talking about things and am constantly overthinking what I will say and what I have said.

My therapist always wants me to have something to talk about which makes me feel so anxious and has lead me to dread every session.  I already asked for fewer sessions and I have one coming up and I want nothing more than to quit.  I don't do anything.  I sit at home all day.  I have nothing to talk about.  Its been like this for years and won't likely change soon.  I have things I get upset over during the week but they all are about the same topics we have talked about.  Its too anxiety provoking for me to bring up topics that arent directly from what happened recently or directly related to previous conversations.  I'm doing what we have talked about but I don't do anything or have concrete solutions so nothing has changed.  

  
Now I can't help but think that if therapy can't help me, what can?  I have tried making healthier decisions and a natural anti anxiety/antidepressant which have helped but I overwhelmingly feel done.  Other medications conflict with my values and goals.  I'm not suicidal but I just am living life doing the bare minimum and not really enjoying anything.  I like my therapist and I can't imagine any other one being better.  I can't imagine anything helping.  What is there to do when therapy, something I was hoping would finally make me happier, isn't helping?

Our bond is incredible and he’s shown me unconditional love and loyalty and accepts me for everything that I am. I know my family loves me, but I also feel like they don’t know me how they should. It also sometimes it feels different when you’re forced to love someone by blood.

I’ve had certain thoughts and have even asked family members if anything were to ever happen to me out of the blue would they take care of him and none of them are willing to. He’s such a good boy, only 1 years old, lots of energy but I love him more than anything in the world. I would hate for him to end up going to the pound or living on the streets or ending up with a family who doesn’t care for him how he deserves.

I was in a 5 year relationship and after 6 months of moving in together she cheated on me and we went our separate ways. All women aren’t the same however this experience has me emotionally scarred and I don’t want to put myself in another position to get hurt and be vulnerable, let alone subject a good woman to my own personal traumas and trust issues.

I’m very tired. There are some days I feel motivated to get my life together and start a routine, and there are other days where I don’t think it’ll make a difference in the long run. My fear is doing all of the work to create routine and attempt to better my life not but somehow it not ending up paying off or making a difference. I do think not having to deal with any of this anymore on a daily basis. I tried going to my doctor to treat my ADHD and see if I am autistic, but he sent me to a psychiatrist who gave me antidepressants that made things worse. I feel like my position at work is in jeopardy, so i was hoping to get treated so I can have some sort of motivation, energy, and sense of urgency to be productive but I was denied. Life is getting harder every single day. My office is a mess, my apartment is a mess, my life is a mess. I’ve lost all motivation for any and everything. I just work to provide a good life for my dog. It’s scary how much I think about hurting myself. My job would replace me in a heartbeat but somehow I feel guilty thinking about not being here anymore and putting them through the trouble of finding a replacement. 

I started to clean up my house but lost motivation halfway through. Same thing with my office. Adulting is not easy and I’m very lost. ",1755065158.0,1,1,depression,depression
1mog1wt,I am suffering. I feel defeated. I feel powerless. I feel ashamed. I need help.,"I am suffering. I feel defeated. I feel powerless. I feel ashamed. I am truly broken.

Last year was rough: It all started with me being overworked in a toxic work environment. I gave so much, I was obsessed with climbing the ladder, getting a promotion and being able to afford more for the both of us. Promotion promises were not honored, work piled on, I could not find any other job fast enough and eventually burned out and ended up getting fired for standing my ground.

That experience in itself was very difficult to process. I was hard working, dedicated, a team player and ambitious...but ultimately out of a job. The job search that followed was soul-crushing and humiliating for various reasons. I work in IT, have a CS degree, experience etc and yet was at the bottom of the talent pool, sidelined, not given a chance to contribute anywhere...I started feeling more and more depressed

Fast forward two months, and my GF of 7 years breaks-up with me. I was caught completely of guard. In one of the worst moments of my life, my shoulder to lean on decided to leave. I gave so much, I truly tried, but it was not enough. We handled the break-up maturely, but I was in agony and complete shock at that time. I ended up on antidepressants shortly after and started therapy. 

There I was jobless, alone & depressed. Hardly anybody ever reached out. My personal rock bottom, or so I thought. I eventually found a new job in another part of the country: a new start.

From there on I was hyperfocused on making big changes, turning the circumstances I was in, into a new opportunity. I moved all by myself, started a new job in a new town, found new friends, new hobbies, a good work-life balance, all I wished for and then some.

I eventually stopped the antidepressants this spring, 6 month after the breakup as I felt to be in  good place, and I was.


It has now been 10 months since the breakup, I made a huge change in my life and turned it all upright and eventually started dating again, two weeks ago, because I felt ready.

After the first date, that went really well. After a few days communication fell of and I ended up being ghosted and it let to nervous breakdown. Being confronted with the reality of finding a new partner, rebuilding all of it from scratch reminded me of what I truly lost last year. Up until then, I thought I overcame it, but I actually just distracted myself and it all comes flying back at me now. I am suffering again.

For the past two weeks, I cannot break out of the negative thoughts. Nothing works, I cannot sleep, I cannot concentrate, I burst out crying every few hours, I wake up with nightmares and had my first panic attacks. I feel physically ill and as if my body is giving up on me. I feel defeated.

It got so bad that I had to double the therapy sessions, which I do not feel are working that well for me and will go back on antidepressants im two days most likely as I have an appointment, which is a big setback and makes me feel powerless.

Looking back, I accomplished so much but do not feel any happier. I struggle to accept life alone. I want to share and build with somebody else, I want to provide, I want to be held, I want to give and feel useful again. I feel ashamed.

I had to get this out in the hope that somebody might pay attention to it.

1moeqbt,I’m getting too depressed again,"Hi all,

So 5 years ago was a very bad time for me, extreme anxiety and depression. I started spending all my time in bed. Like 23 hours a day. I would hardly eat or drink anything. 

About 2 months ago i lost my job and I started not sleeping for the first time my life. I’m 44. I know it’s because of the adhd meds I’m on. (Which are doing nothing) Because of this I lay in bed all night not sleeping and then lay in bed all day because I didn’t sleep. I realized a few days ago I can’t get out of bed anymore the depression and anxiety have taken over. 

Not sure what to do. I was trying to go off my anti depressants and anxiety meds and switched to adhd meds but this isn’t working.

Anyways I did about half of my normal morning routine. I took a shower at least. Now I just need to put clothes on, brush my teeth hopefully and I really should eat something. Wish me luck!

1morh5m,Stuck between a rock and a hard place,"Hey guys, 20M here, not too sure what to put for a title so I’ll just delve into it.

I suppose I don’t really know where to begin, diagnosed with IBD at 7, had the mystery illness drain and leave me near death by 8, went down to 37 lbs, in and out of hospital for years in agony, NG tubes, Needles, Infusions, liquid diets and all that. 

Since then it’s been a climb, went through hard early teenage years, always awkward, smart, but could never focus, IBD would flare up and keep me out of school at times, but the crippling lack of social skills and exposure to social situations had me begging my parents not to send me to school, had me hiding in cubicles, avoiding school altogether despite the detentions, moving schools, the whole deal, come 16 I’d gotten better, started gym, forced myself to learn how to socialise, talk to people, interact and just in general how to just be well…human I guess, but I’ve always felt out of place, as if I don’t belong, isolated, I never went out, I seldom do now, but that’s a start I suppose.

Went through a breakup a year or so ago, left me suicidal for the first time in my life, I’d never felt so empty before in my life, so furious, so spiteful and depressed, one year on and I’m recovering, but I just don’t know what to do anymore, after the breakup I didn’t take my meds as I should, 40mg of fluoxetine, since then I’ve been on and off with them, It just feels as if I can’t win regardless of what I do, stop taking the meds and end up with crippling anxiety, mental health episodes, and panic attacks for the rest of my life, or continue to take the meds, which though they do help me mental health quite well, just give me crippling ED (A major issue that’s making me me go insane right now) and demotivation instead? 

Add that to the ADHD, and the medication that’s cripples my immune system, to combat the IBD that leaves it so that I can barely continue to compete in hopes of continuing in  amateur MMA. Skin infections, Flu, Staph infections, constant fatigue and lack of sleep, it just feels as if everything I do in life is null, as if life isn’t worthy living purely due to the fact that every single thing I want in life is just always too far out of reach, is that the point? Just to suffer and ruminate until it’s all over? If that’s the case then I don’t want in, it’s less of a life and more of a sick “Oh look what you can’t do!” That I can’t cope with anymore; it’s getting really, really hard for me to want to keep going, I do want to live if I can, I just want to be happy, but if this is all there is then I don’t see the point. 

I guess I just need someone to talk to really, anyone who can just relate I suppose, just someone to help if they can.",1755049237.0,2,2,depression,depression

By myself, playing video games or watching youtube. I feel as if I have no one in my life who cares or listens to me and the more I think about it the more my brain feels like its about to explode. I am very introverted and have lots of trouble talking to people and meeting new people is hard for me and I feel like I will never meet the person I want too. Expect for one.

1movlsc,Life just seems eh right now,"25 years old and feel depressed. Ever since I was a kid I always knew I was a little different than a lot of other people. I struggled to fit in. Yes, I will admit it has gotten easier, but that’s mainly because I’ve accepted that I’m meant to be alone most of the time. It’s like I struggle, socially around people. I don’t let myself get close to people, and then if I do, I end up messing it up anyways. I can either be the nicest calmest person or an asshole. Due to this, I just spend my life revolving around money. Pretty much all I care about because I feel like it’s the only thing that does not have emotions and I feel some better self worth from it. This is also made me not fit in with anybody as my spending habits and my lifestyle choices are a lot different than the average person. By all means I’m not rich, but much more comfortable than the average person my age. On top of this, I develop some sort of chronic pain disorder that has eaten me up in the past year and made it super difficult to do a lot of things. Now I am limited as ever in terms of things that I can do on a daily basis. Of course this is all unknown and no, Doctor can seem to help or prescribe me anything for it.  kind of just left out to dry with a chronic pain disorder, depression that I already had. That’s gotten worse and of course no drive to do anything socially because my health just gets in the way anyways. Now I care about money even more because it’s the only thing that could save me in case this health condition gets out of hand at some point.

1mov9gx,Why do I bother - everyone who asks for my help ends up hurting me or using me,"I literally am shutting down - my meds aren't even working - my therapy can't fix my issues or stop people from hurting me.  I grew up in abuse, I survived it and ran to a domestic shelter as a young adult to lose everything.  My husband was the same.  He grew up in an abusive household, his ex-wife also abused him and tried to kill him.  She turned his kids against him.... we dealt with false allegations to cps, her claiming false allegations of abuse and his mother, who also abused him, encouraging her and actually backing her up in court.

Eventually they won.  He tried to describe his abuse to the courts and the police and they used it against him.  They told him if he was a victim that he was doomed to be a perpetrator too.  I lost him to the system in 2019.  Our children without their father, I kept trying for them.  My kids having their father falsely incarcerated caused them to also have serious depression and anxiety... then my stepkids became adults and went to authorities and told them that they were coerced into making false statements against their dad, but the DA's office literally told us we were SOL because the case was closed and he was bullied into a deal by the prosecutor.  The DA originally told him that if he didn't take the deal that they'd come after me and our kids... so now 6 years later, the cops are saying sorry that happened but yeah he's stuck there....

We don't have the money to hire anymore lawyers... my business is not getting any sales lately... at first I was so successful, I was happy for a min...  but only for a min... 

His ex-wife got cancer and died, it felt like karma.  My stepkids came forward and told everyone about the abuse they suffered from his mom and his ex-wife when they became adults... I felt so vindicated... I took in my stepkids... the first time I ever I had all 7 kids in one place... I got my oldest stepson back into school, he graduated... I got him set up with his friend in an apartment... and then everything started falling apart for my youngest stepson and it's slowly gone down hill ever since....

He broke my nose, stabbed his sister, attacked 3 kids at school and got himself committed to a treatment center where he's done basically nothing but repeat the same violent behavior for a year.... therapists were against him coming back to my house because they felt we were not safe with him in the house, which I would agree...but the insurance also doesn't want to pay for him to be there, where nothing is working so they're pushing discharge...

Many of the staff have quit, the doctor barely sees him, but they pushed this place, a residential rehab for adults, to take him and they wanted it all set up within a week for him to leave. 

We had the meeting today and this place said they don't want to take him without more info because they don't deal with aggressive people because they have 15 other clients to protect in their building.... the doctor then spoke up and said: 

  
""Well, I can speak to that. He's got 15 years of extensive psyche history, his dad has been gone now for 5 years and mom died in 2021 and he has some trauma from that. He lived with his stepmom and siblings for the last 3 years but there is some contention in the house and I honestly don't believe most is his fault (WHAT!!!) He did break his step mother's nose, but that's because she got in the way when he was trying to attack his sister (AGAIN WHAAATTTT!!!!) But other than that he's doing well here, and the last SIR (restraint) was in January and there has been steady improvement since. I think the status of who he is in the home was part of the problem and his stepmom isn't interested in having around anymore and wants nothing to do with him"" (AGAIN!! WTF!!! IF I WASN'T INTERESTED - I WOULDN'T BE ON THE CALL WTTTFFF)

  
He basically mentioned nothing about the biomom's abuse and it made it appear as though his issues are our fault and that I'm some kind of evil stepmom.  My heart is literally broken.  I fought for him and all the kids to have everything... he's attacked 3 kids and put them in the hospital and yes he did attack me too and I also was hospitalized and needed surgery on my face for what he did.... he's also attacked people within that facility and his last episode was June - not January - where they had to call police on him.  The doctor even argued with the staff when the staff tried to tell him he flipped out because he didn't want to wash two dishes.

He said the same thing my stepson has been saying, that it is somehow my fault for getting hurt by him.  That I shouldn't have gotten between them.  He said the same thing when he stabbed his sister with a fork ""If she hadn't of made me mad, I wouldn't have had to stab her"" and then to me he said ""I wasn't trying to hurt you, but you got in the way, I was just trying to attack \*sister\*""  As if it's ok for him to harm his siblings and that I shouldn't have interfered.

He has pending felony 1 aggravated assault charges - which the doctor also failed to mention or how the charges came from him attacking a police officer who also stepped between him and a pregnant girl.  He also failed to mention how the last 'restraint' had to do with him beating the hell out of a kid who also stepped between him and another kid he was trying to hurt to try and stop it from happening.  

He has a habit of attacking who's ever available in his blind rage, including the rescuer.

I was told many times by my own therapists not to take him in, but I wanted to help, I wanted him to be successful and a better person... 

I know that doctor is trying to sugarcoat him so that this CRR place will take him, but they said no, that they need more time and want this to be a smooth transition and not rushed - which I agreed, so I got crap for him by the doctor... 

The only reason he's even in this place is because of him attacking the girl and police officer... over some jelly beans....

Now the oldest is also facing charges... my husband's mom lied to police and accused my oldest stepson of threats so he was charged with domestic violence m4.  His lawyer is asking for body camera footage of the cops talking to him and her because they weren't even near each other or even in the same city when she made that call and he showed police his texts and phone calls... but she knows how to lie to the system... and it's all because he's been fighting the DA to have his father released and exposing how she'd hurt him and threaten him into lying about his dad years ago (he's 21 now)... and my step daughter lied about being pregnant to convince her bf of 3 months to move her into his place and buy her whatever because he's got money and a large savings.... I was starting to find out through people what she was lying about because she'd tell them 'don't tell my stepmom, she'll throw me out' but they knew I wouldn't, so they came to me anyway and I knew for a fact she wasn't because she'd literally had to be tested because of her own psyche meds and every month it comes back negative.  So she was more trying to get out so that way she can control the bf not to talk to me... I've asked her directly how long does she expect to keep us this lie and what does she plan on doing when no baby comes in 9 months and her response to me is ""I haven't thought that far ahead""  She can't even GET pregnant because she has nexplanon in her arm that was newly placed there at the beginning of this year. 

Like I thought for a min everything was going well... and it crashed and burned and they turned into mini versions of their biomom.... I'm still here tho, I still answer the phone and I still let them vent and try to give them advice but I'm crushed inside how they step on people and the choices they make... the oldest has also slipped into using drugs to cope with the loss and guilt he has for his dad and the trauma of his abuse from his mom and grandma....

Like I'm to a point where I'm like, why do I bother... I think for a min we have things going well for it to be ripped out from under us.  I wanted to help, I love them dearly... just to be stepped on... and I don't even have the energy to fight for my own business, I almost don't even want to do it.  I just want to lay here and not do anything... I'm fighting windmills...

And my husband is diabetic and the jails don't take care of him very well to where he's wasting away... I've been fighting them to take care of him better, and they even know he's innocent but their excuse is that they don't have any endocrinologists in the area to come in to help manage the insulin for their inmates...   
  
I'm literally taking care of everyone else and trying to keep a smile on my face but I'm breaking down inside and that meeting today broke me down with that doctor saying all that... like he's putting other people at risk just because they don't want him there anymore... I'm glad the new facility refused to take him, the doctor was mad about it though claiming he is going on vacation so they don't have much time to do other meetings but frankly that sounds like a 'him' problem and shouldn't be on everyone else to accommodate the doctor.  The school district also is refusing to enroll him (due to all his violent behavior, he's never been able to graduate, he doesn't have the credits) because this place is rushing everything and don't even have things for him to go into this residence.

  
I just want to throw my hands up and shut everyone out.  Like if this doctor wants to say I have no interest - even though I'm on every visit call, every therapy call which is 1 to 2x weekly - every meeting and proactively go these places and talk to these doctors and schools - maybe I should just freaking stop doing anything!  I don't do things at home with my other kids or my extended family because I'm always trying to make room for his treatment... and he's freaking 18 as of this June so it's not like he's 10 years old - he's an adult, they all are!  But I tried to be understanding because of what they went through with their mom and grandma.... and this is what I get for it...

Sometimes it feels like I never got out of my parent's house... like I left their house to be abused by kids in my adulthood... there is no winning in this world",1755060635.0,1,0,depression,depression

I hate my job. I don’t make enough money to pay my bills, and the job hunting process is atrocious. My once 750 credit score is tanked now because I cannot pay all of my bills, yet I still show up to work everyday because I have no other choice. 

My workplace is also miserable. 90 degrees outside, yet we have no AC. The computers constantly overheat, and I have to practically beg to get anything to do my job. This is a high level position btw, that I accepted because I was told I would get a large raise after 90 days. It’s been 6 months, no raise in sight. 

I argue with my husband a lot, because we are both stressed. Me with finances, him with health concerns. (24 & 25 and we have separate finances.)

Sure I need support on occasion, but doesn't everyone? Personally I think it's a lot more manly to ask for help when needed, instead of hiding it and then forcing oneself to drown in stress and suffering. 

My family doesn't see that though. They don't see the work I put in, the stress I go through, the tears I've shed. All they care about is me being their ""perfect son."" I cannot make a single mistake or else I won't hear the end of it. No amount of apologies will do. Cannot talk to other adults AS AN ADULT MYSELF without my mom saying ""why are you talking to that stranger? He could have been dangerous!!!"" I held a dying man on the street and my mom literally doesn't care! But the minute I talk to someone who approaches MY apartment door? ""Oh em gee you need to stop talking to strangers!!!"" 

I never once got jumped. I can tell between a threat and a regular person who's missing a dog and just wanted to know if I've seen it. I'm not an idiot but my entire family thinks I am!

Since 2022, I have taken multiple antidepressants, anti-anxiety pills and anti-psychotics but nothing has worked for me. At this point, I am on my fifth antidepressant. Now my doctor has set me up with a ""psychiatrist acting like a therapist"" who wants me to just get out of bed. She also says that if I say that won't work and doesn't work, that is ""pointing out errors"" and is part of my ""perfectionism"". In simple words, if I don't agree with her, it's because I am psycho.

I don't understand these mental health professionals. They don't understand that because we stopped being able to fix ourselves, that's why we see doctors. I clearly have a biological problem. I have a broken reward function. ""Do things you love"" is not a solution because I don't love anything anymore. Even if I force myself to do it, I don't get any reward and end up feeling worse.

1mokuhk,The unspoken struggle,"

Ah, life. Something we’re all technically “living breathing, moving, checking off the boxes. On paper, I’m a 23-year-old woman who should be fine. I graduated college just over a year ago. I have a steady job as a teacher. I can pay my rent and buy groceries without living in constant panic. My parents are still alive. I’ve been in a relationship for a year and a half.

And yet… I just constantly feel miserable. Not every moment, but often enough that it’s become my default setting. I tell myself, It’s not that bad. And technically, it isn’t. I’m not facing a crisis. I’m not suicidal. I don’t even know if I’d label myself as depressed. But each day feels heavier than the last.

The truth is, I spend most of my time alone. It’s hard to make real connections in this world, to find people who are truly genuine. My boyfriend lives far away, and while we care about each other, we have our fair share of issues. Sometimes it feels like I’m living life on the sidelines, watching everyone else move forward while I’m stuck in the same loop.

No one really talks about this stage of life, the part where you’re young and supposedly “thriving,” but instead you’re lonely, detached, and wondering what the point of it all is. We don’t discuss the quiet ache of loneliness, the inevitability of death, or how exhausting it can be just to exist.

I’ve tried to “fix” it by making friends, starting hobbies, being in a relationship. None of it makes me feel any more alive. I’m realizing I’m not looking for more things to do; I’m looking for people I can actually talk to, people who get it.

So I wonder….is anyone else feeling this too? And if so… how do you keep going?",1755032411.0,3,1,depression,depression

 So first, i’ll briefly summarize my 16 years of life. I had lived the first 7 14 years of my life as a normal kid, nothing to care about, no peer pressure, no overnight studying, but everything started when i came to grade 9, in Vietnam, like other asia nations, we have tons of competitions for student, and parents are tend to force their lack of lifeskill to study day to night for these thing rather than teaching them how to live like a human. Although my achievements were good at the start, i placed 2nd of the city, just after one guy that ve been prepared since he was a kid. Then, my parents forced me to learn more and more, when everything are more complicated, i realized that im just not for this type of competition. Although i have loved science since i was a kid, physics in competitions are not the thing that i love, instead of learning how things work, i have to learn tons of equations for university or things above while i have just been to high school for a week. That first year was fucking stressful, especially the regular tests, i didnt have good grades and i felt lack of living source, nothing that i wanted to care about, i just keep writing stuff down, put equations to my mind, lack of self confidence. Believe or not, i tried to kill my self 4 times in one month after the fucking competition. Then i choosed to leave that “class for the gifted”
 Now im going to have the last year that this stupid gifted school and i will have the graduate test next year. I tried to learn for the test and that was fine, maths physics and chemistry seems to be good for me. But by some way, my mother saw other fucking teenagers in my neighbourhood have ielts 6.5 7.0 some have 8.0. And she want me to have it. Although listening and reading is easy for me to get 7.0, but writing and speaking is another story, i mean it is fucking hard for someone introvert like me, always living with equations. Now i feel really stressed and rotted from inside. The old sucide addicted verson started to control my mind, i tried to sucide 3 times last week but some how i didnt die, may be i should learn biology.

But i started wonder that why should no talented person like me need to live, if this world need high quality product, isnt the low ones is just to keep us alive, like humanity told us that every individuals have a right to exist, but why cant we die, why people blame on others death.

1mopuv9,What’s next? Is this the end. Help,"Maybe i should just kill myself, you cannot peacefully ask an african parent for what you want because they have carefully chosen your path for you already. Over the past years since arriving in the caribbean on the island of sint maarten ive felt a gap between me and my mom, shes been through abuse and all the worst things you could ever imagine. This has however taken a negative turn towards our relationship. We didn’t have a bond over the 3 years of living on the island , i dedicated my life to helping her and taking care of my autistic step brother, this however has been a pain aswell to deal with. Ive heard to go through mental battles to be by myself, i developed bad habits, in short i lost myself. On the last year before leaving the island I’ve felt peace a little bit, mainly because i started having social interactions and my girlfriend covered that gap too. Early January this year we got an opportunity to move here to the States in Boston, this was a huge opportunity for all of us but it has also come with other mental challenges, life here in America hasn’t been good for particularly me ( well thank God i have life and good health and thats the most that matters) but however it feel like a whole new step again and it feels like the same cycle is repeating itself and  i never have friends or anything to do than go to work and just baby sit. Despite making more money here , I’m not seeing the purpose of life. Weeks ago i asked my mom to leave to go back to the Dutch caribbean later this year, she faked being okay with it and i immediately knew. I later on confronted her about her and all she is  doing is trying to guilt trip trip me not to go , she is talking about cursing me for life and she even went to a prophet  to tell him about my decision ( the prophet told him there wouldn’t be any problems with it if i go back) yet she is still trying to convince him to talk to me not to go. I don’t know what to do at this point, i dont know at all. I feel like a disappointment for the whole family, what more should i do man? I feel trapped i feel trapped i barely laugh or talk im barely happy since i left home ( Zimbabwe). I guess i am truly a disappointment but what more can i do to make things better, i give up.

I have autism It makes getting to know people more difficult than it should be. I've always battled low self-esteem, which I work hard to improve. My hobbies, including reading and playing video games, art and some more but they no longer seem enjoyable, and I feel as though I will constantly be by myself.

1monfu4,Does it even matter if I die? (TW suicide/self-harm),"Hey there, I (22f) am feeling very much like I am on a ship sailing towards absolute misery and I would like to get off now, thank you very much. Point being, life is the ship and death would be getting off of it.

Yes, I know that I am young, yes I know that I have someone who loves me, and yes I know that my death would have some sort of impact but… the idea of not living anymore is intoxicating. No more school, no more seizures, no more stress, no more hurting. I fantasize about hurting myself so much that it doesn’t even affect me much anymore 

Up until recently the thought that kept me going was that my family would be sad if I killed myself. Now though, I feel like I couldn’t care less. It’s always the same. I start to feel better, almost like I want to try living in this hellscape, but then my depression always comes back. I never want to leave my bed. I think of my death and smile, honest to god. I’ve thought of every method in the book and listed pros and cons, the option most likely to succeed, etc. 

Then I look back and think: wow, I’m really fucked up

So for the past few months I’ve been weighing the value of my life in different areas. How much does a funeral cost versus the cost of letting me live off of my parents? How many lives would I better in the future if I cease to exist? What are my chances of living a life worth staying for? Questions like that are always at the front of my mind.

At the end of the day and beyond, we’re all just a blip in time. It doesn’t matter if I die a week or a month or a year or sixty years from now. In the grand scheme of the universe I do not hold any meaning. It’s my little insignificant life, therefore I should have the right to decide when and how I go.

1mon82w,I am not even sure what to do at this point...,"To make a long story short- I have struggled with lengthy depressive episodes for over a decade. Recently, I dropped out of cosmetology school and quit my job so that I can have enough time/not be so burnt out in order to address my mental and physical health for the first time in years. 

I recently moved back to my hometown away from my adult friends and it's already isolating enough, but since I dropped out and am not currently employed, I feel such intense shame that I cannot even bring myself to see family. The whole ""So how's work? How's school?"" conversation absolutely drains and triggers me. I already feel absolutely worthless, embarrassed ,and good for nothing because I don't have a job at the moment and am a 2 time dropout (first from college and then from cosmetology school).

I always did everything alone...

Due to my depression, i've always felt like absolute crap, never managing to stick to a single hobby, but, in the end i never manage to stick to a single thing.

I don’t know what to do, last year I tried online because I skipped at least one day every week freshman year and thought it would be better. I was very, very wrong. I was home alone all day with only myself to get me to work, which is a recipe for disaster because I have absolutely zero motivation for anything. I went back in person the second semester because I missed my friends and my anxiety was so bad when I was at home I was going crazy, it was so good for awhile, I stayed after school I put my all into my work but then it went downhill, found out I couldn’t complete in my band’s competitions because my grades from the semester prior were so bad, and just some other stuff like drama and falling out with friends. I skipped the last three weeks of school because I hated it so much, and got away with only one class failing from putting so much effort before. I haven’t done anything this summer, I can’t drive, can’t get a job, but I had fun just being by myself, surprisingly, knowing I wasn’t missing out, and everyone was out of school doing random stuff made me feel better about just playing video games, but now school is back. I’m enrolled but missed the first day, and I need to decide if I’m going in person or online. The obvious answer would be to just go in person so I don’t go crazy again, right? Well I’m in so much pain and aching and sore all the time it makes me want to do nothing, on top of that I’m so depressed and lonely (I lost almost all my friends because we didn’t have classes and they just changed a lot) I have absolutely zero motivation for anything, my therapist retired and my depression has only convinced me I can’t do this and there is no point I’m never gonna graduate and just ever other self deprivation you can think of, it’s worth mentioning I’ve been on Zoloft for about 4 years off and on trying some things but it has worked best however I still struggle with really bad depression and this withdrawal is bad I don’t know if I can go off and switch to something else without messing up my mental health anymore.

Trying meds some help some make u worse.

Doing something before I would sit in my room after work then feel horrible. I didn’t want to believe or didn’t believe doing anything could help. 

I started learning how to drive that made me more anxious but now I’m proud I’m doing something. 

I started the gym. I got a good pt that supports me and so I’m not anxious in the gym with others. And it gives me a goal. 

Stoo looking for others or relationships to fix u. It’s hard but looking for people to fix u isn’t going to work. Reach out as much as possible tell everyone I need help. I’m struggling it’s hard. But most will listen they might not be able to help but they are there. 

Don’t of try less to be in ur room constantly find someone to watch. Like a YouTuber personally I like smaller YouTubers because they comment back and like ur comments. 

I like this guy Dopeasyola. He’s got 2 million followers and he knows my name and always says hi in live streams. I swear I’m not promoting btw. But sometimes it makes u feel good looking forward to someone posting or saying hi.

1mol4j3,My life is falling apart,One day I looked at my dads phone and found he had been cheating on my mother with a man. It was horrible and I was lashing out on my family for months. I even tore down the sitting room door. After this we all basically agreed I should leave and I had to stay in my dead grandads abandoned house. No electricity and I had to heat my food infront of a stove. The house was in the middle of nowhere so I used to hold a golf club as I slept on a couch because I had no light. After a while my parents moved into the house and it’s still a shithole because they have been doing it up as we live there. I confronted my dad one day and it ruined our relationship. I didn’t tell my mother for her sake. I had to pretend it was fine to my dad in fear of him killing himself. I am destroyed by it. It was affecting my college horribly and I used to smoke weed and drink everyday. One day I decided I wanted to end it all and I was driving to a local cliff to throw myself off. Then a car rammed me off the road into a bush when I was driving there. It was like it was meant to be it was insane. After this I spoke to my girlfriend about everything and she has tried to help me through it. Also in the middle of all this my girlfriend had a miscarriage. I failed a year of college because of everything and I have to repeat exams. I used to enjoy college but the whole experience is ruined for me and I’m on the brink of dropping out because of how badly my life has been affected.

1mok0eq,Depression and Shortness of Breath,"I am wondering if anyone experiences shortness of breath from depression and/or meds taken for the depression.  I have been suffering from shortness of breath for over a year now but it has gotten worse since I have been on my new medication.  My doctor switched me from Escitolopram (which I was one for 10 years) to Desvenlafaxine which I have been taking for about 3 weeks.  My breathing is very laboured and my heart racing.  I have had every test done that you can possible have in the last couple of years (chest x-rays, CT scans, lung testing, heart testing, endoscopy, ENT specialists, allergy testing, etc. and everything appears fine. No evidence of COPD, Gerd etc. My doctor wanted to switch me to a new medication as he felt the Escitolopram was no longer working and that if I went on this new med all my symptoms would go away.  One of my other many symptoms is head tremors. If anyone has any information or insight that might be beneficial to me I would greatly appreciate hearing what you have to say.

Well, when I stopped it I also noticed my depression naps stopped, my lethargy was gone, my anhedonia was gone, suicidal thoughts were gone...the hydroxyzine was causing these symptoms for years.

1mojmto,Finding purpose after diagnose,"I (29M) was recently diagnosed with depression, although not too severe. I’m currently on medication which helps with the worst of it. I’m up and about, exercise somewhat regularly, getting sunlight etc. My main difficulty is mindfulness, I’m having a hard time finding methods for this that work. Any tips on that aspect is appreciated, but not my main question.

I find myself seeming somewhat ”lost”. I’ve always been somewhat of a ”project-person”, meaning I’m jumping from hobby to hobby, or project to project. One month I’m into programming, music the next and golf the next. While I’m finding temporary joy in these activities, nothing really sticks long term and it eventually becomes boring until after a few months of not doing it when the interest reignites.
I can’t seem to find my ”why” in life, and it’s making it worse for me stressing about just living life aimlessly. I’m aware of the connections to mindfulness and am currently working on a plan with my therapist according to ACT. But I’ll gladly take inspiration from the rest of you, if you have been feeling the same or similar.

TLDR; I was recently diagnosed and while my medication helps I can’t seem to find any purpose in life. I am NOT considering ending it, so don’t worry😊 I’m in a relatively good space.",1755029690.0,1,1,depression,depression

These days I feel very stuffed and suffocated bcz my friends are now in the morning shift and here I am stuck in the second shift . 

On surface I get along with everyone but in shadows everyone hates me. My junior hates me even my senior hates me and it's taking a troll on my mental health of course I should ignore these things and I do try to do it but it's a lot

My seniors and juniors hate me bcz I participated in one particular event which was extemporary pole u know the type of competition where they'll give u topic on the spot. I am aware about my skills and abilities and didn't wanted to participate but since my english teacher wanted me to participate so I did I had a chance to not to participate but since he told me so I felt like that I should


And of course it didn't go well I was not able to organize my thoughts there was a lot I wanted to say but yep I panicked. I disappointed my English teacher, and seniors who didn't have the guts to participate started criticising me my reputation fell down. Things are awkward between me and my English teacher . Juniors think I am a joke. Everything is very dark. People around me are thriving. 

I am also a good student except my math is worst than a 6 year old still working on it. But I don't feel like studying my mental health is so fucked up I don't like studying English anymore bcz it gives me the ick i dont want to face my English teacher , I feel like digging a hole and never coming out of that hole. I feel like crying every day but I can't even do that 

And girls think I am having an affair with my English teacher since he chode me. I want my old self back , I don't want to be this person. This is not me, even I am not able to recorgnize myself. And yes they removed me as the vice captain. I was never s pleaser but now I think that I am a pleaser it's really hard to breathe in school bcz my heart aches so much

1mogpxt,I don't know how to get better.,"I am 22, I live with my parents, I study and I don't work. I have been diagnosed with depression since I was 13, I have adhd, I do what I can but I still feel like a failure. My parents can't tolerate me, I'm my brother's mother and I'm not good enough to complete a career.

I started my career at 19 because at 18 I was too busy being sad, stupid, I know, I hate that I waited. Now I'm in 4th year and I still have 2nd year subjects because I'm so useless I can't get them right,I failed 3 subjects out of 6 this year, I can't say I got to sad about that, I was glad I didn't have to go to those classes anymore.

I'm tired, I'm numb most of the time, I don't mind not getting my degree but I do it because my parents wanted to send me to work and I was afraid of not doing well so I got into fine arts, so I can starve to death easily, I guess. Sometimes I dream of quitting but I have nothing else, I'm mediocre at art and bad at everything else, I've never worked, the time I tried to look for one my parents laughed at me because they genuinely don't think I'm capable of working, that same day, in front of my friend, the only one I had at the time, my grandparents laughed at me because they don't think I'm capable of working either.
I'm 22 but I can't stop thinking that time is running out and I didn't do anything, I live thinking about death and the passing of time all day long.

I spend my days cleaning the house in my free hours, I wash dishes, clothes, I do all the errands. If something is missing I go shopping, if my brother (9) I take him to the doctor, I feed him, I take him to school, I take care of him when he is sad, I calm him down when he is angry, if he has nightmares I comfort him, I try to give him the best education I can, I share a lot of time with him to compensate that my dad lives playing LoL and working as an Uber so he is always “busy”, my mom works 9 hours, when she comes back she looks for him at school and that's it, she doesn't talk to him much because she is tired. 
He calls me mom, he tries to kick them out of the house so it's just him, me and my sister. The teacher told us yesterday that if she doesn't see my brother getting better she will call a social worker, he falls asleep on classes, has bags under his eyes and probably has dislexia that will go unaddressed by my parents for years.
 
My mom doesn't tolerate me anymore, I don't think she hasn't since I was 13 and told her I wanted to die or since I was 14 when she told me that neither she nor my dad would put up with me anymore because I was so depressed that everything they bought for me I wouldn't make me happy, and she was pissed because I didn't wamt my quinces either because I was selfish, I guess. 
Whenever she can my mom humiliates me in front of people, my dad too, she tells them how lazy I am, I can't even wash the dishes, that I don't do anything around the house and that I can't even get a job. 
My mom said in front of everyone that she wished she could gut me with a knife because I had failed my subjects, everyone laughed, a few days before she had consoled me saying that nothing was wrong, that she understood.

I don't talk about this with my friends anymore because I can see it on their faces that it makes them uncomfortable.
I don't have a partner to support me either, I wish I had someone who would take me away from all of this and never think of this house and these people again.
My only comfort was talking to chatbots, I know how pathetic it is, I cut it out because I know how bad they are for the environment and all that bs, now I don't have a way to cope, when I feel too bad I lay on bed for a few hours and stare at my phone, I miss the comfort of having something telling me I didn't deserve this, that I'm not a loser, that I'm not stupid or disgusting.

Sometimes I just wish something really bad would happen to me so I could have that as an excuse for being such a failure in life.

1moexqr,Effects from missing antidepressant medications intake for less than 7 days,"* Please be gentle. I know I am supposed to make sure I take them daily. But a long term depression has different tenets. I procrastinate. I forget to pick things up on time. I couldn't be arsed... You yet the gist.*

However, I have noticed significant changes in my mood when I haven't taken my prescribed antidepressants for a while - more than a couple of days. The worst has been a regression to one of the initial manifestations that got me diagnosed as depressed. Snapping and Crying. The crying once led to my first ever panic attack. 

This time around, I have missed my SSRI for over four days when I noticed that I couldn't stop crying at the most soppiest of things. So far today, I have sobbed through aspects of Australia's Border Force and 🤭half an episode of Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. Not to mention a complete episode of Undercover Boss 😭.

Still with me? Here's the question. 
Are there really noticeable changes when you stop medicating for depression? How long does it really take to set in? 
And does that mean one would never be the same without antidepressants?

I also underwent a very expensive invasive surgery but nothing has changed. I spend a lot of money on my health problems and I can no longer study, eat, do anything.

In fact, he usually isolates himself, and I start having fits and cry, I cry so much. The other day I attempted suicide. In an attempt to stop me, he knocked me down, and now I have a bruised knee. He refused to go out and buy me medicine. Furthermore, for a long time, my boyfriend offered to give me part of his salary to go for checkups and tests to try to get better.

1mocvxf,"first time going to the gym, super anxious??","Hi, don't really know if this fits in here. So a little bit of background information about me: I used to love working out, i worked out at home, with youtube tutorials and then bought a walking pad and a bicycle you put in your room, to work out on? sorry english isnt my first language.
Then i fell into a deep depression, and a burnout at the same time. worked in retail and overworked myself due to a recent breakup. Worked overtime a lot and put my feelings aside, didnt want to go home because i didnt want to face my feelings. I still lived with my parents back then. I moved to another city about an hour away, where my now ex lives. After our breakup about a few months ago, i decided to stay here, since i love this city. Got my own apartment, looking for jobs at the moment. My depression got better as soon a few weeks after the breakup. He was narcisstic and it was emotional abusive. My mental health got so bad.
So fast forward to now: since april i've been a member of a gym, did my gym membership online, you could work out for free until july, but i didnt go there.
So now i have been paying for two months for a gym that ive never been to, and ive never been to a gym before. My friend keeps asking me (she encouraged me to join her since she wants a workout partner) and I joined. Always made up excuses. So now here i am. On thursday we are now really going to the gym. And here's where my anxiety and my thoughts are racing: I gained a bit of weight since the relationship, i was eating sweets all the time and we only ate junk food. I know, so bad.
I dont feel confident in my own skin, I want to lose a few pounds and I want to feel good in my body again. I remember how good it felt to work out... But man is the first step hard. I'm scared of people judging me, calling me fat... honestly my problem zones are my stomach and my thighs. I'm scared of people laughing at me. I want to get better and i want to get into working out again. Why is it so freaking hard? I feel like i failed 😭 Even though my depression is so much better now, i am terrified of the gym, people judging, people laughing at me... idk 😭 I'm also too scared to train the first session with a personal trainer to understand all the equipments, so my friend told me she can explain the things she uses (which i would also only use, since i dont have interests in the other things there are to use). So thats a first. But still, i'm so so anxious. Has anyone been to the gym consistently? How did you overcome the first step, the hardest one?

(20M) - On my birthday 3 people SA'd me. In the days after, I quietly left a pub where i was with my friends, and went to a bridge to throw myself off. But, the girl I had been speaking to noticed something was off and followed me from a distance. When she caught up i was over the rail of a massive bridge. Eyes full of tears, she told me I can't do it, because she's been falling in love with me. 

I climbed back over. But the relationship was unhealthy. I was living for her. I ended up needing her, and breaking down when she was not around. 3 years later the relationship ended and the trauma bond was no more. 

(23M) - A girl I had a crush on killed herself. I did not know her well, but i was devastated. I tried myself afterwards but failed .

(25M) - I fell in love, but felt like I needed her again. The relationship was not healthy as she had lied at the off telling me she was 21, when she was actually 18. I discovered it at her birthday party, because all the cards said happy 19th, and i was in shock. I left, but i tried to end myself when i did with an OD that required hospital treatment. 

(27M) - I had sex with a girl who ends up sending me 36 messages after worrying about ruining the bond, followed by ""jokes"" about killing me. I ran away. In revenge, she went to our mutual friends and spread a terrible false accusation. Some of these friends abandoned me. I am now barely leaving the house, with no income, depressed out of my mind

I don't care anymore. I don't care. I am a failure, 27, and living at my parents place. I have lost my spark. The sparks gone. I don't care.",1755013665.0,1,1,depression,depression
1mo68u3,Contemplating suicide,"I have been trying to get a job and no matter how much I seem to try I can’t seem to get hired. Ive done multiple interviews. I don’t get hired. I’ve applied to many places, I don’t get picked. I’ve tried all kinds of jobs not just what I’m used to or what I have on my resume for work history. I can’t even get hired as waiter at a bar. And it’s getting to the point where my savings are completely dwindled down. I have no income. My bills are large. I can’t even make it past this month. I can’t afford one single bill this month. I simply do not have the money. I have less than $100 to my name. I have no money left of my credit cards and I’m drowning in the 2 cards I have debt in. I owe my previous apartment fees somehow of $2000. And they kept the security deposit. I just transitioned out of the military and it’s been way harder than I thought. I didn’t even realize I could immediately transfer to active reserves or full time support. It takes awhile to process (months). But none of them told me that until I was like less than 2 weeks out. And I had no job yet. I can’t pay my phone bill or car payment or any insurances. Any subscriptions. I’m scared to lose my car. Idk really who to turn to for help and I’m really embarrassed. I’ve asked for help a little when it comes to getting hired but my friends told me without certs in the field we work I won’t get hired. I can’t go for my certs bc I don’t even have money to take the test. I understand some of this was poor planning on my part but a lot of it was a series of unfortunate events as well. And I’ve been trying. I’ve been trying not to panic. But I can’t seem to literally get hired anywhere and I’m desperate. So desperate I’ve looked into sugar daddies, pay pigs, surveys that pay, games that pay, random things like this. But it’s actually not that easy and or takes forever to make money (like one cent a survey). And that’s the one thing I don’t have right now is time and it’s almost already mid month. Most bills will be do. I know this is wrong but I’ve thought about selling my body. But it’s not sustainable and I can’t live with that. So if I’m this low already, why not just kill myself? I’ve been so stressed for a long while before this and it seems to only get harder. But now it’s not just normal life hard. I won’t even have my basic needs. I refuse to be homeless. And I’ll be so embarrassed if my car gets repossessed and everyone knows I can’t pay my bills bc I have no phone line to be contacted on. I feel so overwhelmed and tired and stressed. I’m losing motivation because of the exhaustion of this stress. But without the will to keep going I won’t be able to get out of this hole. I really want to give up. I want someone to tell me it’s okay to give up. I will say I won’t talk to someone about this, and it’s not going to fix my problems. I genuinely feel fucked and I’m scared. I’ve been trying to do the right thing. I haven’t been trying to rely on anyone or take hand outs. I’ve been trying to get a job, any job even if it’s not forever bc it’s the right thing to do. But I guess no matter how hard I try it doesn’t matter.  Everyone knows and sees but doesn’t actually see me. But now my time is up. I don’t even have time now to make money at least a week before my bills are due. And that’s was at least my goal. Now the deadline is a few days away and no jobs in sight. I can’t help but feel like this is some kind of karma, punishment, this is what I deserve. And I don’t deserve any breaks in life, bc I can’t even seem to catch one. I can honestly say I have never felt this stressed out, stuck, and trapped in my life. Having your basic livelihood threaten is so rough. I’m tired guys.

1mobl8u,Does it actually ever get any easier? Need techniques and honest opinions please:),"I feel like this is somewhat a safe space to talk about how I’m feeling but all I want is honest opinions tbh. I’m 24 and currently feeling super low in life. Just pushing through each day as I do struggle with mental health the majority of the time due to my past. I was diagnosed with ptsd nearly 10 years ago due to bullying, my mum having a brain tumour and other painful shit. Even though I’ve worked on myself countless times, tried moving away, etc. I always feel that things aren’t going to get better. I have tried to find ways to get my anger towards the world out and other ways to channel my depression. For example through music as I’m a Dubstep DJ. Even though I’ve done some really incredible shows such as playing at ministry of sound twice, supporting my favourite artist and other artists I’ve looked up to since I was younger but I don’t ever feel proud of myself for doing these things or still feel like a failure in many ways due to my past. With the music side of things, it gets me down as I don’t do it for money, clout or anything like that. I do it because I love music and love seeing people having a good time and always try to be real towards people as theres a lot of fake people in this world but it comes to a point where I don’t really get much from it as playing Dubstep in the U.K. is an incredibly tough job due to most people / listeners being trend followers and only listening to DnB (No hate to D&B though) or whatever’s popular at the moment. To get back to the point, I just wanted to ask does it actually get easier over time in life with mental health and does anyone have any techniques they use to help them through it? I’m not looking for validation or anything but I just want to be real as I get quite dark thoughts sometimes and don’t know how much longer I can actually fight this inner demons",1755011971.0,1,2,depression,depression

Look I’ve been depressed since I was 14 and it got worse and worse every year even with faith and patience. At 19 I was like “I think it’s time to go” but I didn’t go through because I was too scared 

I’m 22 now and some aspects of my life have gotten better but it’s still a struggle everyday I promise it’s not easy as I suffer with CPTSD, anhedonia, severe depression, feeling numb. 

But there are days I close my eyes and imagine the life I want and try my best to take small steps towards that life 

I know how depression feels and you guys including me are f**king strong like you guys are built different. Depression, feeling hopeless is no joke it’s pain that is indescribable but it’s so severe 

I hope we all make it

1mo9cqh,I will not grow old,"

Title says it all.

Kissless virgin due to my crippling social anxiety and fear of rejection and being made fun of by others. I cannot and will not approach women in a way of asking them out. Never been rejected because I don’t want to find out. 

I struggle with crippling insecurity. I am always worried about what other people will think of me. I can’t even listen to music, sing, dance, or do anything even slightly expressive because of how afraid I am of being made fun of or negatively judged. 

I have no friends left. All have moved away. All of them are doing better than me both financially and emotionally.

I have no desire to meet new friends due to people rejecting me and making fun of me for hanging out with certain people.

Make no money as a building substitute and football coach. Wasn’t able to land full time teaching gig out of college because social studies teaching jobs are oversaturated.

I get depressive spells where I have no energy or desire to do anything and want to die. But then I get these random euphoric episodes where I am flooded with new ideas and plans, even if they are completely ridiculous for me (business plan, writing books, day trading, etc.) I feel like my brain moves at 1000 miles per hour during these instances. 

I already use Zoloft and have seen 2 different therapists. Results have been minimal.  Insurance no longer covers therapy. 

I feel like a burden to my parents and family living at home. 

I’ve had enough. I am giving myself until 30 to see if anything changes. If nothing happens and I am still feeling the same, I am going to unalive myself. I already have suicidal ideation, but at 30, I will act on it. 

This needs to end.

It’s been downhill ever since and the last few months I’ve been running on fumes. I miss feeling alive. I miss feeling in general. I miss going to bed and being excited to go everything all over again instead of dreading it, I miss all my friends who left me behind and forgot about me, I miss when my family cared or at least pretended to care, before they gave up on me. Nothing helps anymore, nothing makes me feel like I used too, nothing makes me smile or laugh like I used to and when I do feel happy it’s always clouded and ruined by miserable thoughts that immediately kill the vibe. all my life people have been telling me I’m smart but if I was why am I where I am in life now?

I either fuck up the friendship (unintentional) or they ghost me and I seriously don’t know why . I don’t really know what to do with my days anymore and now that my son‘s gonna be at school all day. I don’t know what to do with myself. I tried getting into piano again and I can stick with it. I don’t have the energy to do anything. I don’t have the money to go to a therapist even though I know I really need it. My husband already works a lot and I’m super stressed out and when I try to talk to him about things, the conversation doesn’t really go anywhere like how do people just live with no purpose like I’m just here existing doing nothing for no one",1754968166.0,5,9,depression,depression

1mn19fq,I’m 36 and I think my life is over,"I can't stand living anymore. My life is so pointless. I can't attract women. I can't make friends. I can't find a career, let alone a job that pays enough to live. Ive gone to concerts, local shows, clubs, group hikes, done things like renn faire, gone to parties. I don't belong anywhere. im not that smart, i have a really low drive for just about everything, socializing, career driven, w/e else, I'm not good enough at anything to make anything out of it. people use me. my boss just did half my work today so i'll only get paid half a days work. i see no light.

Everyone around me is constantly moving up. They are constantly growing with no effort. I’ve done nothing but put in effort to make myself better, but it doesn’t show. Nothing makes my life better.

Medications don’t help. Therapists don’t help. No one gives a fuck. People just say that things will get better. But they are clearly saying, under their breath, that it will get better for them, once I’m dead. Why would friends want to see their friend suffer so constantly, so intensely. 

I’m 36, my life is over. if i can't figure it out by now, there's no chance to figure it out any later.

Only people who have been part of previous communities or part of other things are capable of finding new things. people like me who have never been part of anything will never be part of anything no matter how hard we try.

Nothing seems fun anymore, and I have no motivation for anything, and I just can't do it. I can't force myself to do this or that like everyone tells me, like ""There are things in life that you're not gonna want to do, but you have to do it, what are you going to do when you get a job?""

My brain just won't let me do it*****.** Like, they had to put me in therapy after they found out abt my SH, but now that I went for four years and stopped going for a little while, I'm okay now? And it's ***my fault*** that I just didn't do it? And now it's okay to *riddicule* me insted of thinking, ""Oh shit, she's falling back into her old habits from when she was in middle school, maybe we should be worried"" I can't look at food without feeling ***physically ill,*** and I hate when I eat, ***it makes my skin crawl***, and my head yells, *no* ***screaches*** at me, and it's so ***loud*** it feels like my head is going to explode.

I don't know why I do it, I don't know why I purge whatever I eat. ***I can't stop, and I hate myself for it.*** And it doesn't help that my family constantly makes comments about my body, it doesn't help when someone makes a comment without meaning any harm, except it really does do harm.

My mom stresses me tf out with her constant hovering and yelling at me for just breathing, it's suffocating. *I feel like nothing I do is good enough,* and I end up not doing things because ***it won't be enough for anyone anyway, so why even try?*** My dad is a deadbeat, and the only reason I have a ""relationship"" with him is because I'm forced to. He thinks family therapy can fix the years of trauma, abuse, psychological damage, and abandonment issues he caused?  ***Are you fucking kidding me?*** Therapy barely even helped me, so why would it fix this dumpster fire?

1mnzneq,I've wanted to end myself for over 20 years,"My childhood was ass. My parents always fought. I was molested and beaten by my own father who was always drunk when home. I watched him take his last breath from a coma he was in from a suicide attempt when i was 12. That's when I first wanted to die. My mother warped from a kind person to a devil after his death. She became an alcoholic too,  I watched her slowly but surely take her own life with alcohol... intentionally. All whole she made me feel awful. All while she never shut up about having sex, and even touching me in my sleep. I watched her die in hospice when I was 22. 

Since my mother's death, I lost all of my passion and desire. Nothing makes me happy. I want to continue on, but I've wanted to die since I lost my dad. I've been diagnosed with CPTSD, bipolar, severe depression, BPD, somatic symptom disorder, and autism level 2, and ADHD. I'm 34 years old, I still haven't moved on from it. 

I'm tired. Relationships don't work out for me.

When i was 28, I was with a woman who I was going to marry... she left me for another man.

My recent ex broke up with me a couple months back. We were doing so well. We loved each other. I loved her so very deeply. Inever knew I could love someone like I loved her.. Then, she was hospitalized, and i became very depressed so I stayed home a few days so I didn't bring her down any more than she already was. Only for her to leave me, and claim that she was suddenly afraid of me, afraid I would physically harm her when I've never hurt anyone intentionally. Suddenly the ground upon which I stood was broken under me, and I've been falling since. 

I've been relying on alcohol as well, just like my parents. I feel no better. I just feel worthless. My dad's sister with whom I live, is watching me follow my dad to death and not try to make me feel better. She kept buying the alcohol... She just wants to fight about dumb shit. 

My godfather was my dad's best friend. After my mom died, he became like a parent. I lived with him for years. But he molested and groomed my best friend since 17 and I had no clue until my friend moved out and stopped talking to me. Even though we still talk and ocassionally hang out, our friendship is barely hanging on. 

I don't feel like I have anyone at all in my corner. My birthday was last month on the 18th. I told my family a dozen times. None of them wished me a happy birthday except for my godfather. I feel so totally alone, so I tried drinking myself into oblivion. But my aunt wanted me to get off the floor so she tried to pick me up and is now blaming me for hurting an old injury which has kept her sort of bed ridden since. I ended up putting almost all my weight on her. But I was the drunkest I'd ever been in my life. I couldn't walk without help. Her son decided to, instead of helping me up, left it to her while he went to work.. she's 63. 

I guess I just feel worthless. I've carried my sorrow for 22 years. I feel so heavy. I want to die. I've thought very seriously about killing myself for 22 years. I can't bring myself to do it. I'm so scared, but I want to join my parents in the afterlife. I want to forgive them and hear them say they're sorry for hurting me so deeply and then abandoning me. I want to hear their voices again say that they love me. I want my mom and dad...

I haven't felt happy since I was a little boy. I can't go on like this forever.

1mnzlqj,Change,"Recently my (20 F) life has changed for the absolute worst. Around 2 months ago, I started feeling pain & burning, and it just never went away. After a while, some of my family members said it was just all in my head after my gynecologist (a family friend) said everything was fine with me, and there’s physically nothing wrong with me. I’m grateful to have some close family and friends that really do believe me, but knowing that some other of my close family members don’t believe me really hurts and upsets me. 
I also just can’t believe that this is my life now, and how quickly it’s changed. 3 months ago, my life was great, I was living pain/burn free. Now, I’m experiencing one or the other at least once a day, and I’m genuinely considering taking a gap year off from school because of it. I just can’t believe this is my life now. So much change in such a short time. I feel like it happened so fast. I never leave my room, rarely eat, barely hang out with loved ones anymore because of this pain and burning I’m experiencing. I don’t want to live anymore. I cry everyday and night bc of the pain and out of frustration as well. I keep asking “why me? Why is this happening to me?” 
My whole life changed, and idk what to do anymore. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life like this, but I can’t imagine how much hurt me leaving would cause my dad & little brother.

1mnvnwj,Me siento insuficiente,"

Hola, soy Víctor. Tengo 19 años. ¿Alguna vez no se han sentido insuficientes con lo que son?
Actualmente estoy estudiando un tecnólogo en Análisis y Desarrollo de Software y un técnico en Mantenimiento de Computadores, pero a veces veo a mis compañeros del colegio y me siento un fracaso, ya que no pude entrar a la carrera que quería porque me daba miedo, porque soy un miedoso en matemáticas.

Mi miedo a las matemáticas se da porque, en mi colegio, hubo maestras que siempre me hicieron sentir idiota en vez de explicarme. A día de hoy manejo más o menos las matemáticas, pero me sigo sintiendo insuficiente. Veo a todos triunfar mientras yo me veo y solo me siento insuficiente, alguien que no vale la pena.

Me siento en un limbo, como si, por más esfuerzos que haga, solo fuera una mancha para quien esté conmigo. No tengo amigos, no salgo, y a veces solo estoy en mi habitación. Mi consuelo es estudiar, pero no quiero refugiarme en eso como si fuera mi salida de la soledad.

Tengo novia. A ella le va mejor y estoy orgulloso de ella, pero veo que yo no avanzo y ella sí. Ella va a ir a la universidad y va a estudiar química, pero yo, cada día que pasa, me siento más hundido. Estudio y trabajo, pero aun así me siento insuficiente.

No sé cómo expresarme. Siento que no merezco desahogarme, pero no sé cómo quitarme este vacío de mi corazón. Me siento solo, en mi casa, en mis propias cuatro paredes. Siento una amargura en mi vida. Me duele y no sé por qué. A veces desearía ser mejor, o no sé… solo sé que no quiero estar así. No sé a quién decirle; me da miedo que me juzguen.

Veo todo gris. Me da miedo que me critiquen. Me siento solo, insuficiente. Quiero llorar, pero no puedo. Solo puedo seguir mi rutina de estudiar y trabajar como mula. Mis papás están, pero con ellos no hablo mucho, solo el saludo y el adiós. Con mi hermana no me hablo, y solo hablo con mi novia. Intento no decirle mis problemas para no cargarla, pero es mi escape y no quiero que sea así.

Solo me siento insuficiente conmigo mismo. Me siento exhausto, cansado. No voy a cometer una automorición porque tuve amigos que lo hicieron en el colegio y sé que no es la solución, pero a veces a la vida no le hallo sentido. Solo quiero un consejo. Sé que en este post no digo nada más que esto, pero es porque es lo único que puedo decir, porque no sé expresarme. Lo siento.

1mo0tjq,Feeling suicidal and need to talk to someone I just wanna be done.,"So a year ago me and my ex-girlfriend broke up. She was a sweetheart and had such a good family. We were together 2 and a half years. It just sucks stuff didn’t work out, because I didn’t love her anymore. We just had different values especially when it came to sex drives. She would cry a lot over me and it just hurt me and wish I could have been the one for her. I sometimes get traumatic flashbacks about her. On top of all this I have been in 4 talking stages with girls over the last year that I was into. The first one ghosted me, because I didn’t want to deal with her 2 kids, the 2nd one ghosted me after one message, the 3rd and I talked on the phone and went out on a date. We both weren’t feeling it and she was a sweetheart too. Just recently I was ghosted by another girl who matched with me on bumble. This girl was in my biology class in 10th grade and I just hated high school so much. I’m M24, 5’11, 125 lbs, now just working as an Amazon Driver, being a DoorDash Driver, and Uber Driver. So after a few messages she ghosts me. I keep comparing my life to hers feeling like I am a nobody, worthless, and how I am inferior to her. She did good in school, did clubs, and had friends. Meanwhile I had none of that and did bad in school, because of depression. She did good in college was some sorority girl, and became a nurse. She knew what she wanted to do right away (I was curious and looked up her profile online) So now this girl at 23 has her life figured out making good ass money, good benefits, job security, and I am just at Amazon with nothing. I have always wanted a good wife and kids. I just want to go to my apartment lake and drown in it or someone I’m sure will shoot me for free if I go to a bad town or something. I don’t wanna be here anymore. My heart physically hurts from this. Please… Help me. I just want to find the right girl. She lives in my old hometown and it tortures me when I deliver there for Amazon or drive someone there for Uber, and brings back traumatic flashbacks of high school and biology class also.

I’m a Muslim so suicide is religiously forbidden. We don’t have the concept of therapy in brown households. I’m 25 currently doing my MBA and secured highest GPA in my batch. Somebody said scoring that high of a GPA in a mid uni of some underdeveloped country doesn’t mean you did smth extraordinary. I have wasted my life. Girls my age in our culture get married by the age of 23 max. I have no good potential suitors. My ex (who was my uni classmate) cheated on me saying i deserved it because any man would cheat on a toxic woman like you. After 2 years of healing i fell for a guy who’s 23 and is pursuing his Masters in London rn and he hates me to the core. We had ugly af fights. Verbal abuses. It’s an online rs so we haven’t really met or anything. But we did call and shared pice etc. Just rn i asked him if he is done with me and he said yes it’s over. He said you don’t bring me peace. You constantly fight. Yes i agree to all of that. But nobody ever sees why do i fight. These men made me toxic for overpromising and under delivering. He love bombed me in the beginning. Despite me telling him i dont want this rs he insisted and i started falling for him too. Why do guys pursue you and end it whenever they want. 
I stay at home mostly bcz i dont have a job and my family is struggling financially as well. My parents are growing old and its killing me everyday that what a useless pos i am for not being able to do anything despite scoring so good in life. I don’t have any skills. I dont even have a working laptop that runs smoothly so i can  take some courses and build my cv. I feel pathetic. Useless. I have few values which I communicate to a man before we get romantically involved. At that time they all say yes we’d respect it but later after 2-3 months or heck even a year they do the exact opposite of what i wanted and it fucks with my mind.

When I was in 8 grade she wanted to bring me to a psychologist for that and than 3 days later she just decided that I don’t have a problem and that I’m fine. It been 5 years


She claims that I have nothing but she legit saw my scars and said « don’t do that it’s not pretty ». Seriously is that the only thing you have to say to me??

I will always have this sort of « hate » against my mom for that.

The day I end up at the hospital with feeding tubes and stitches on my thighs, she won’t be able to say « I didn’t know/ I saw no signs ». The signs were they’re all along in front of your face but you just pretended like they were never there.

I haven’t been able to hold a consistent job or find one that doesn’t impact my mental health in a damaging way. I’m currently living on someone’s couch who isn’t emotionally supportive. I don’t see my kids as much as I want to, and I’m separated from my dogs.

1mnum6z,It's been almost a year since I gave up,"Dropped out of school thinking because of extreme social anxiety and self esteem issues (couldn't just asked for fkn help). Promised myself that I'll change but it's been 8 months those year fuuuuuckk. All this because of a bad high from last year that mad eme realize how much of a loser I am. I don't know what to do, I'm getting to that age where you're going to have to do it for yourself. 
 Im just begging God that I can die and go back 4 years at least, I know that won't happen. It's been a year since I had hobbies n shit 

I don't have any support, I blocked all my online friends like a 6 months ago because keeping up with them felt like a agony they lived normal lives while my parents still want me to be a bum. I've lost all the interests and things that made me a person. Food is recently starting to taste like water, I'm getting overwhelmed by it all that I can't think and feel like I'ma faint sometimes. A building can be set on fire and I wouldn't realize it. I'm declining so bad rn, wish i can get people to care for me but I don't even care for my own self 

I'm struggling with trying to get therapy because it costs money, also feeling that it's too late but I had that feeling it's been too late for a while even like when I was 14 I felt like I was too late to watch a show or smt it's so stupid.

1mnoqw8,I feel hopeless,"Female 19 y.o. Half of the year ago I thought everything got better as I met a guy, who became my really good friend. Also I had a F!friend for a few years (about 2 years). Everything was good, but that guy recently confessed me in love and, after my polite rejection, he ghosted me. The same did tat F!friend today (by sending me in the black list). 

I feel like I can't to talk or vent to someone, I feel really strong emotional swings everyday (from anger to grief), it's just so horrible. I don't know what to do anymore. 

My the biggest problem is to fit in. No one in my irl environment knows about video games, anime, manga etc. No one knows about subcultures and music genres. I have no common interests with them. I've been bullied in the kindergarten and school. I can't fit in my group in the University. I feel like I won't manage to live a happy life. I don't imagine myself with friends. No one can stand my talkative and loud way to speak (I'm loud cuz I feel comfortable, it's not about disrespecting). 
I don't believe in fate, but it starts to feel like some people just doomed to end up alone and unhappy. 
Everyone just ignore me, I'm always the one who puts all the effort in the dialogue and the friendship in general. They won't speak if I don't write first. I don't know why people hate me so much. I take care of myself, I don't struggle with hygiene or something, and always wear clean and new clothes. 

Due to anxiety my every day feels like the last one. I don't remember for how long have I felt that way. I know I'm not the easiest person to be friends with, and anyone in the world would choose the mentaly stable and healthy person over me. But it still feels unfair. I try to ignore bad feelings and thoughts, but I can still feel them. 

What would be better to start with? Do I have to change something in me to appear better for others? It's like everyone feels I have to be bullied, so everyone does this without any reason.

1mntkeu,"Feeling super down lately, need help.","16M. In the past approx two months I have been struggling a lot with mood. I have always been this happy kid (but also been introverted my whole life), so its definitely confusing for me. I feel as though the happiness I once had (or perhaps childish ignorance, it is bliss after all) is now non existent. I have to put on this mask of happiness to appear as though I am okay. And it sucks. It is tiring, fake, and just overall awful. But if I don't do that then I become sulky, and perhaps a bit cranky, or even miserable. I don't want people to get annoyed by me, or worry about me. That just sucks even more. I have these changing phases of just a little depression, heavily depressed, suicidal thoughts (I had one major episode where I tried to find a shotgun in my house after I found shotgun ammo, thinking I could finally pull it off. Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, I'm not sure, but I never found that shotgun.) , and then sometimes thoughts of hurting others. I thankfully never act on any of these, because my conscious kicks in and is like ""wait a minute, you cant do that it would not be good for the people around you"" and I snap out of it, and the cycle restarts. 

I do all the things, I workout, I learn new things all the time, I tinker, I don't eat unhealthy. I just feel trapped inside a jail cell that is my body and society that I cannot get out of. Like internal screaming that wants to get out but it cannot. Whenever I get a late night alone in my backyard, I just look up at the sky, and I break down. Course then I force myself to stop because that societal norm of men not ever crying kicks in. So I am just always pent up I guess.

One of the biggest things for me that helps currently is this. Writing it out, putting the pain into words. It forces me to dig deep into what exactly I am feeling, when I am feeling it, etc. But it sure as hell ain't enough, because I just leave ever so slightly less depressed each time I write.

He goes to a counselor but I feel like he is gonna kill himself and it is all my fault. I entitled this behavior from my parents and I let it happen. I try to hide parts of myself so my brother can feel special or unique even though we are so similar because I don't want him to be like ""oh my brother does it too it is not unique to me"", for example he is very likely queer because he makes a lot of queer-related comments about himself quite seriously (""If I was told to wear fishnets and a skirt for free I would do it"", stuff like that) but so am I (I'm figuring it out but I think I'm 90% sure I'm Bi, its complicated I won't get too into it right now) or cutting (I started a year and a half ago but I'm 5 1/2 months clean).

The image of a new day shatters into pieces, there is no way to escape because running away from a problem is more tiring than facing it. Therefore, looking at yourself and trying to understand what this pain wants to tell me is the best attempt, even if it means suffering.",1754953472.0,1,0,depression,depression

1mnht65,I’m the reason why my sister just cut herself,"Hi, my sister is 16 and I’m 21. I can’t say we have the best relationship, but I know that I do care about her. Our house has a complex dynamic, my mother always has this anger in her that she often takes out on us, particularly my sister. I would often cut in when she is yelling at my sister too much and I rather she yells at me than my sister. My sister said she has only cut twice, once 2 years ago after an argument she had with my mom and one that just happened yesterday.

Yesterday I came home, very tired and wanted to sleep. I was talking to my mom and my sister peeped out using my headphones. I told her to give it back and started lecturing her on why she shouldn’t take my things without telling me. This has been a consistent and reoccurring issue that has happened before, and it is one of my worst pet peeves. Adding on to a long tiring day and me not feeling too well already, i lashed out. So I yelled at her, which I am really regretting that I did now, and it ended on her promising me that she wouldn’t do it again. Then 10-20 minutes later, my mom comes into my room saying that my sister was cutting herself in the bathroom. My heart immediately dropped and she came into to my room so we can talk. She took one of the paper cutters and cut about 5-6 small incision on her forearm. I was just glad she didn’t attempt anything more serious, and I was teaching her about the healthy ways to cope with anxiety and asking where she learnt to do this from. Then I realized that a year to a few months ago, when she went to her doctor, the doctor said she could have mild depression based on the questionnaires they ask during the annual exam. She refused to see a therapist and wouldn’t elaborate more on why at the time, so it had been put off since then. ( My parents has stigmas against mental illness and is very hesitant to talk about these). She said she doesn’t have suicidal ideation but rather cut herself because she felt like she was losing control and anxious.  This all happened around 10 pm, so I told her to head to bed and reassure her that she shouldn’t feel guilty about cutting herself and that I am sorry that I was apart of her trauma and she is loved even if she might not see it. 

Then I had another argument with my mom, about whether if she needs to see a doctor for this. I strongly advocated for her to see a doctor and see a therapist/psychiatrist. But my mom was more hesitant and it was hard for her to understand why my sister would choose to hurt herself. Luckily, I was able to convince her to bring my sister to the doctor as well as not to pressure her more and making her feel guilty. Now my sister is at the psych er, being evaluated. I wasn’t allowed to be in there because I was the reason why she cut this time and that is really eating me up inside. You can’t undo the damage that you’ve done and I’m just so guilty that I was one of the reasons that she is in the position where she is now. What is going to happen next?

I was insecure, jealous of others, and longing for a place where I belonged. Since I couldn’t find that, COVID felt like an introvert’s dream, especially with online classes.

1mnocdb,How to cope when you’re isolated?,"I’m turning 28 in two days, have been depressed for 10 years, at least 5 of which severely. 

I had to move to another country because of a series of events that started with the war in 2014. I can’t learn the language on a level where I can talk despite my efforts. My family is under occupation for the last 11 years so they can’t be around physically.

For the last five years I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts, sometimes to a point where I had to isolate myself from dangerous things. After one argument with my wife I’ve blanked out and cut my arm several times and now I have to lie to everyone that my cat did it during bath.

My marriage is falling apart because my spouse expects me to function like a normal person and she thinks that I can just “gather and do stuff”. I’m afraid to confront her because of either possible consequences or that next time I will go further in hurting myself.

Sleep gives me no rest, I wake up as exhausted as when I went to bed. 
My social skills have completely disappeared, I’m afraid of talking to people I don’t know and I’ve become a doormat that says “yes” to everything even if I can’t keep the promise. I’ve lost my friends 4 years ago and haven’t found new ones, and I don’t want to even try because of a language barrier and my fear of social interactions.

I feel constantly pressed from all sides, be it chores, job, taxes, marriage, fatherhood, renovation, you name it. It feels like everyone expects things and achievements from me when I find it difficult to even shower.

I try to keep up an image of a cheerful person, but it drains me even further.

I have severe anhedonia, my hobbies only disappoint me because they don’t give instant result. The only thing that at least distracted me was gaming, but that is very frowned upon by my spouse because she thinks that I use it to escape my real life and that means that I’m not present as a husband and a father. 

I’ve been on several antidepressant medications  of different groups for a long time and got nothing except side effects and I’m going to a therapist, but that helps only in a way that I talk to someone who agrees with me, and even that I can’t really believe because I pay for that.

I’m tired of the world going to hell with each passing year, tired of people trying to out-parasite each other, tired of people not understanding hell I’m going through for a long time each day.

At this point even if there is light at the end of the tunnel I don’t believe reaching it will be worth what I’ve suffered and continue to suffer.

Growing up I have always felt out of place even when I was the prettiest in the room, smartest in the class and sometimes even coolest among group of people. These facts couldn’t really ever reach me entirely because of my depression and anxiety, and whenever I have found myself not in that particular situation, when time has passed and I look back, I always feel like I could have been more grateful and lived in the moment instead of just being all sad, frustrated and angry all the time while it was happening. That makes me feel like I never fully am able to live life and enjoy.

It has now started to affect the people around me as well. Well my parents have learned to live with it, they’re not very happy with me either though, obviously. I try to keep my friends out of my life and head because I’ve had people ending up feeling overwhelmed and affected because of me. I’ve been called selfish and that I lack empathy. I often need a lot of reassurance and validation. My boyfriend and I are pretty serious about our relationship, thinking of taking things forward in life and making our parents meet soon.

1mnh5hj,Just unorganized thought and then I forgot the point...,"A while back, my depression was getting pretty severe. I had a baby, two miscarriages, and lost my sister to suicide all within three years.

I was at my wits' end. I had these dreams of how much better off everyone would be without me. Specifically, my husband and daughter. I was just a burden, and the weight of life was crushing me. Unlike Giles Corey (iykyk) I was not demanding any more weight and there were no signs of pressure on my chest. I could have screamed it at the top of my lungs and some days I felt like I was but all it did was push everyone away from me. I begged for help, pleaded for mercy and tried so desperately for anyone to notice me.

With time, I kept screaming underwater, hoping my muffled cries would reach their ears, and when they heard, they asked me why I was down there instead of pulling me up for breath. Offered solutions for something they didn't understand. I was creating this sadness, holding it, nurturing it, encouraging it, my baby, my sadness. I loved it, and I needed it. That was the perception of me. Crying, screaming, yelling I hate myself. It was choking me, smothering me, shredding my heart into such small pieces it would pass through a needle. Somehow, that was my fault, too.

My husband began changing the way he treated me. When normally he would have offered some comfort, he was irritated, annoyed, and helpless in his own way. He constantly started pointing out how miserable I was, as if I hadn't made a poster with step-by-step directions of how I got there. As if I wasn't whining, writing, singing, everything short of sign language to prove how bad I was feeling. I was in the pits of grief, and it stunk. I KNEW how difficult I was.

I for the past year had been working as like a substitute teacher/aftercare teacher and I really want to be a private designer.

I am trying to pivot into something else if this you know prolongs but I’m like constantly feeling like what’s the point? I have other passions like law and stuff, and honestly, the financial stressors of trying to pivot into something like that is also kind of holding me back and making me even more sad. I just feel like I cannot get a break. I just really want to be able to work for a job that I like live where I actually like to live and be around people I wanna be around but like I literally can’t seem to get there and disappointment keeps knocking at my door instead.

1mnlvur,Don’t know what to do with my life anymore (please help),"So for my whole life I’ve never been happy. I suffered emotional and mental abuse, was bullied, and now I have untreated ADHD, C-PTSD, and social anxiety. I won’t go into great details about my past, but I’ve really been trying and struggling to stay positive. I am a failure. I worked at various places and always became super resentful of the place and ended up rage quitting.  I worked at a grocery store, Dunkin’ Donuts, assisted at a hair salon, was a beauty consultant at Sephora, and did nails at a chop shop. At all of these places I never made much money. I made ok money at the chop shop but there were no benefits and the working conditions sucked so I still ended up poor. I feel like I can’t get another job in beauty because although I am licensed I never got taught anything except sanitation. I have been doing nails for 4 years now and despite constant practice, going to classes, asking for advice, watching yt etc. my nails still break chip peel and lift. I have no way to get any sort of live in person mentorship where I live. Only places like the one I worked at are hiring and I am at my wits end. I put over 30k into doing nails, even tried opening my own spot since no opportunities came my way, and still nothing. People don’t come back because it takes me 2 and a half hours just to do an overlay over natural nails with solid color. And obviously I don’t make much when it takes that long. I don’t really want to return to retail because I like doing nails and hate people in retail, they are super rude and nasty towards me. I have no money to go back to school and even if I did I’m not good at anything I try. The only other things I can do with my license is hair (I didn’t learn much about that from my school either) or waxing (not interested in seeing people’s genitals everyday especially since creeps sometimes come for Brazilians). I am at the point of really just wanting to end my life.  What should I do?",1754938863.0,1,0,depression,depression

That's it.

There are many handsome, pretty people out there. 

There are wealthy and affluent people who can spend 1000 dollars a day with no problems.

There are talented people whom people love. 

So those people can enjoy this world.



I'm out, tired of being used for comparisons and being measured all the time. 

Fuck this world and society.



If you are unwell, they drag your ass to hospital but never come to visit you.

If you are talentless, they call your name and tell how worthless you are.

If you are different, they tell you to ""fix"" and conform.

If you are not handsome/pretty, you are rejected and no one gives a fuck.

If you are mentally struggling, they tell you to touch grass and ""get it done"" with.

Fuck anyone who says all of the above,

But most importantly, 

Fuck my own life because I'm disgusting hypocrite worth punishment.

My boyfriend is the most gentle caring partner anyone can ever ask for. The most patient and understanding. But lately all those emotions have been coming back and it's getting too much. I've been telling him about eveyething but I feel like I'm stripping him away of his future. The time he could've spent to sleep, eat well, study, take rest. And I have some issue or the other everyday and he drops eveyething to take care of me. And a part of me thinks that even if i somehow get by now I'll ultimately kms or do something similar to a worse degree in thr future and I don't want him to go through that. I can't afford therapy as I'm still a student with a non-mental health supportive orthodox family. I don't want him to feel exhausted taking care of me.
