1mqnfgq,Am I addicted?,"My husband started me on cocaine 7 years ago, I also developed my drinking habits from him which is basically binge drinking. He is an alcoholic and got busted about a year ago for his third dui. He is now on probation and cannot do anything.

It is not in anyway a daily habit for me and I don’t consider myself an alcoholic or drug addict. He gets mad at me when I fail which I think is fair but he treated me like shit for so long while he was drinking daily that I use that as an excuse to do cocaine and drink about once a month or so.

1mql8ht,Addiction Help :),"Hi everyone, 

I know that it might seem insignificant, but I'm struggling with a relapse in my nicotine addiction. It's very hard for me to say no to substances because I so desperately want something... if I don't take one substance, what's another to fill that void? It's exhausting wanting to quit but being afraid of the withdrawal and discomfort. I quit vaping once already, but I picked it up again during a manic episode I was experiencing... which was in March, and I'm still battling it. I put down the vape, and that's a huge accomplishment, but I started using Zyns to ""help"" get off vaping, and now I'm addicted to those. 

Has anyone ever used a template or worksheet that allows you to track your progress? I need something to beat it this time. I'm not a cold turkey type of lady; it always leads to more disappointment because that method is ineffective for someone who's already all or nothing. I just need some help, please.

1mqbb81,Struggling with so many questions on overdose,"Such a long story, but I search daily for any insight or understanding of what has happened. 

My ex husband who I had been living with for the past 3 years, died of an overdose in his hotel room, states away, a month ago. My son and I are still living in deep sorrow with so many questions. None of this makes sense to us. He worked 14 hours a day as a superintendent. He was driving home 7 hours the next day.  He did have a previous crack problem years ago. The obvious is it came back to haunt him. The shower was running for 30 hours when they finally broke the door down and found him. He had fallen in the bathroom they said. I wonder if fentanyl is involved here. Just wish I had known. Not sure what I could have done.  

Do you think he was in pain during this overdose? Why the shower on? I don't know just don't understand. Police said they found tin foil and copper wire. Is that crack tools or something else? We wont have any answers at all for 90 more days after his autopsy comes back. I just wonder if someone put fentanyl in something that he did not know about.  Just want to understand.

The illegal moves.

I broke my skull, brain bleeding in 3 places. Broke my jaw. Broke a shoulder. Broke my back in three places and damaged my hips and knees. I dont remember a thing and I'm currently awaiting leaving hospital and going to a place where I can recover from the damage. I can't do anything by myself right now, I lie in bed 99% of every day, since my pain is really hard. I'm prescribed 120 mg of morphine+ 50 mg pn, but as a former heroin user, it doesn't do a lot. I'm leaving tomorrow for a place of recovery and I have no idea how long it will take.

It's really difficult for me to understand this and difficult to accept since my life as clean was going really well. I think this will influence any desire for drugs i will fell as time goes by.

1mqkk1m,journal entry i am sharing about wanting to stop being addicted to reading mm books and consuming bl content.,"i am writing this entry today because i feel like ive got an addiction and no matter how much i attempt to get in control and stop doing it , i tend to relapse time and time again and go in for more hits of this. every time after, it becomes too consuming and makes me very unable to focus and do or even find any interest in doing anything other than *this*. for 5 years now , this has been and on and off matter in my life that i always go after in different shapes and forms but the same premise every time  yes. in these past 2 months though, this addiction has become unbearable and it’s all i keep returning to even though i swear to myself every damn time that it will be the last time. i feel more controlled by it then ever before and it’s drowning me and my pursuits and my creativity and love for what other things life has to offer and i *hate* being trapped in a cycle. i value my freedom and the space of thoughts and mind to be clear , not thick and foggy with something else infiltrating it every second. that’s suffocation, even if its suffocation on a drug that feels so exhilarating and wrongfully right , it’s still suffocation. and i need to stop the hands on my throat from clutching on and on and bruising me but its so hard because its my own hands. but its time to lower them down. for good. 

i need to stop reading mm books. i need to get off ao3 with all its tags and ships. i need to stop consuming bl content and romanticizing male relationships. 

i can give myself all the grace i want but at the end of the day it’s still perverted to read the content i read, it’s still fetishizing relationships between the male gender, it’s still reducing something complex into a fantasy i consume solely for thrills and butterflies. its still feeding an addiction that keeps me chasing the same feeling instead of building a life where I can feel that excitement in healthy, genuine ways. and it’s still keeping me stuck in a loop that i know  i am so ready to break.

unrealistic is what it all is. and at the end of the day what am i even spending so many hours consuming? guys f—-ing each other really. making out , maybe having harsh confessions, confronting their feelings for one another. there’s angst, there’s hurt, but i also gain some kind of odd comfort from it all. which is what throws me off. and maybe that’s the *strangest*part — fiction has always been a safe place for me, a way to feel things deeply without risking getting hurt in real life. It can be good, it can be inspiring, it can even be healing. but it doesn’t have to be this. it doesn’t need to be peeking into love that’s so made up, love that will never be mine, love that i am reading with a sick motivation and wrong, disgusting intents like an emotional arousal from erotic content. what i am doing constantly is partaking in *sexualized escapism.* psychologists describe this term as using sexual or romantic content not just for physical excitement, but to feel emotions, butterflies, or a sense of thrill that’s missing elsewhere. 

its so addicting because its so easy to get hooked on it gives me a rush of dopamine, the chemical  directly linked to pleasure and excitement. i get butterflies, feel  tension, and emotions without any real-life risk, which my brain finds thrilling. it gives my brain a break from boredom or stress, letting me feel all these intense emotions quickly. since i did this so so much, my brain has now started to associate reading all this smut and books with comfort and excitement, so it become a habit. 

but this is unhealthy because its become an overindulgence now and i am sick of it. there’s a difference between enjoying fiction and using it like a crutch that i cannot escape out of,  and  i am starting to see ive crossed that line. 

you see i have been reading books like this and watching shows with these relationships for so long that my perception of love seems to be altered from them. for years on end i have selected couples that i think are so extraordinary and unparalleled that regular couples feel boring and without any depth or difficulty to me. i have centered myself around what everyone referred to as forbidden , taboo, and exploring the unknown and unfamiliar and getting tangled in it in all sorts of ways feels like its calling out to me and showing me sides of loving that not everyone understands. its not simple. its deeply complicated , its all high stakes and novelty. 

but here’s a better truth. here’s a note for myself and anyone struggling with similar issues. 

it’s completely natural to worry that if you step away from mm content, you’ll miss out on all the extraordinary, intense, and complicated relationships you’ve loved reading about. but understand this: the world is full of stories — in books, movies, shows, even real life — that are just as layered, emotional, and thrilling. the kind of love, conflict, and depth you crave isn’t unique to the specific stories you’ve been reading; those feelings exist in countless other narratives, in different genres, cultures, and experiences. you can take away good things from everything you’ve read , they’ve not  disappeared and evaporated into meaning nothing for you , we are merely pulling back    your mind and matter away from overindulgence in what makes you constantly feel angry, disappointed, and guilty for and that is such a big act of self-respect and self-love,  giving yourself space to heal, regain control, and focus on things that truly nourish your  mind and heart.

stepping away from this specific habit isn’t harmful — it’s opening your eyes to the wider world of stories and emotions. you’re not cutting yourself off from intensity, connection, or excitement; you’re choosing to experience it in ways that aren’t tied to a compulsive and cheap patterns. you can still find characters who struggle, who love passionately, who face forbidden or challenging situations — you just haven’t discovered them yet. and because you’ve spent so long loving the depth of romantic fiction in this way, your sensitivity and appreciation for complicated stories will make the next ones you discover even more meaningful. 

think of it like pausing one book series you’ve been rereading over and over. the stories aren’t gone — you can return anytime — but now you’re free to explore a whole library of narratives and other experiences that can thrill you, challenge you, and move you in ways your brain hasn’t experienced yet. quitting the addiction isn’t a loss; it’s a gateway to even richer experiences. 

take the good , the good is the fierce lover in yourself  — the part that feels deeply, loves passionately and without doubt, and craves excitement, but in ways that don’t destroy you and trap and exhaust your brain in misguided, inappropriate ways just to feel something.  the good can guide you toward real joy, creativity, and connection, without leaning on habits that leave you frustrated or drained.

its going to be hard at first, but i do think i am strong enough to push down desires that don’t benefit me to my most gracious extent or anywhere near there at all. and writing all this is me reminding myself how important breaking out of this is for me. and i want to do this, i  have put my mind on ending this cycle , and i want to put a line through it. and finish it off. yes of-course i am accepting the dread i might feel , but i want to remind myself that they are real addicts out there who were addicted on REAL drugs, on  FAR more horrific things that i can ever imagine and they went to rehab when they knew it was time to stop and they were so courageous and brave and now these amazing people are so many years into sobriety. it might seem like a far reach but comparing two different addictions isn’t a dramatic thing to do because, at their core, all addictions work the same way in the brain: they create habits and cravings that feel hard to resist. by looking at how other people overcome their addictions, you find and see hope that change is possible for any habit, even if the content or behavior is different. it’s not about saying one addiction is worse than another — it’s about understanding the patterns, learning strategies, and realizing that if you truly put your mind to it, you can take control of your life to make the changes you know will better your health and happiness. 

to feel fully committed to this maybe i do need to make a real plan on how to cut it down so i can stop in due time. and yes. Yes i definitely will do that. because i know i need to.

1mq2ch1,Wondering if rehab is the right way to go?,"👋 so I quit drinking and doing drugs around 6 months ago. Then about 2 or 3 weeks ago I started hitting my weed pen once or twice a day, then I grabbed a gram of my favorite, coke, which I love to cook into crack and smoke. This was around a month ago, maybe less. Yesterday I went and grabbed another gram, consequences be damned when I know that it’s a very real possibility that my wife will leave me if I smoke crack. I just did it anyway, didn’t think it was a big deal for some odd reason. She left our house and went to her moms, and a couple hours later when my gram ran out, I went back out for a ball. So I’ve been smoking somewhere around 17 hours now and I’m gonna finish the bag. Even told her that. It’s impossible for her to understand but I just told her that right now I will choose the crack over almost anything. I can’t give it up and can’t stop as long as I have it.

I have a real problem here. I think about getting high almost every day, let’s say at least once but the thought of how good it would feel to get high always lingers for awhile and keeps coming back even if I manage to distract myself from it. So I just have intrusive thoughts and a compulsion, I’m not physically addicted to drugs. What do I do about that? My wife wants me to go to rehab or she’s leaving me. Cuz I’ve never been before. But will it help? Will they even take me? Anybody else ever been in a similar situation? Any advice would be cool. I’m high as a lab rat and sitting on Reddit at the moment.

1mqi7an,Day 4 – The Sudden Pull Back Toward Old Habits,"This morning was fine. I ate breakfast, felt a little lighter than usual, even let myself think, “Maybe I’m turning a corner.” But at 2 PM, the craving came out of nowhere. It wasn’t even from a major trigger I was just scrolling YouTube and stumbled on some basketball highlights. Instantly, my mind was back in that place: calculating odds, spreads, totals, like nothing had changed. I almost justified it with the classic lie: “Just one small bet.” But I remembered what the coach at my program said your addiction doesn’t want one, it wants all of you again. That stopped me in my tracks. I decided to get outside and walk for an hour, no phone, no headphones. I focused on breathing the way the recovery guide suggested. At first I felt silly, but it actually calmed me down. What I’m realizing is that the sneaky, quiet urges the ones that hit when I’m bored can be just as dangerous as the strong ones.

1mq868w,I Was An Addictions Nurse At 19,"As a nurse who worked with patients in early recovery, I wanted to share my experience, I hope it resonates or offers hope. 

At 19, I barely knew who I was. Not fully an adult, not a child either. I could administer controlled substances, though I was too young to purchase alcohol. But here I was, with people on some of the worst days of their lives. The sudden switch from living a substance-dulled life — where all you can think about is chasing the next high - to realizing that you've lost your job, family, kids, savings, and complete autonomy. Then the guilt sets in, and it's crushing.

Watching the light return to my patients' eyes, and their skin gain a healthy pinkish hue replacing the dusky pale, felt like validation - that I was doing things right. That my impact mattered. I looked into the same eyes that regained a sparkle, and with my own tired eyes, told them I was happy they were still here. That they had another chance at life. They'd taken one of the hardest steps anyone could take.

Maybe they were functional and worked as a therapist, physician, lawyer, or fellow nurse. Maybe not. And that was okay. Addiction looks different for everyone. Some walked in seeking treatment and believed they were ready; others were required to attend by court order. That made no difference to me. To me, the start of ""ready"" was the first set of tears that fell after withdrawal. I could tell the numbness was gone. Just feeling something is better than nothing.

I was the nurse that other nurses gave their patients to because they were ""frustrating"" or “non-compliant."" What I saw was fear, mistrust, and anger - fear of harm and judgment, trust broken by others who claimed they could be trusted, anger because life wasn't fair. And they were right: their struggles were not fair.

Those were always the patients who sought me out the most. Age and gender didn't matter. Men in their 70s, women in their 50s. They looked at me and said, ""It's like you just get it."" All I could do was smile and nod. I couldn't tell them that, despite the difference in choices, some of their pain looked familiar. I've had patients around my age look at me as I get their meds and ask why I'm there. Asking if I was a patient. They couldn't fathom someone so young being their nurse, and if I'm being honest, neither could I.

The most common question I got was, ""Can I do it?"" My answer was always, ""Every day that you're still here is proof that you can keep trying."" I never lied. Some asked on their last day, then relapsed and came back two days later. Others left and became the greatest versions of themselves. And sadly, a few lost their battle. That is the reality of addiction.

For many patients, right before they leave, I talk with them for a bit. They tell me their plan, goals, even dreams. I picture it along with them. And finally, a handshake — a handshake because they've truly earned my respect, and perhaps l've earned theirs. They thank me for my care, and I thank them for giving themselves a chance. I wish them the best and watch them walk out the door. It's them and their outside support now. I take a moment to reflect, then step back onto the unit to care for my next patient.

I hope that for at least one of my patients, out of many, they felt less alone during one of the most fragile periods of their life.",1755194554.0,2,5,addiction,addiction

When they told me I was being removed from training, it felt like someone had taken a sledgehammer to everything I’d been building. This wasn’t just a career opportunity — this was my redemption arc. This was me proving that I was more than my past. And in an instant, it was gone.

The shame was unbearable.  
I couldn’t look my brothers and sisters in training in the eyes. Couldn’t face the instructors who had been pushing me to be my best. Couldn’t stop thinking about the people back home who had been rooting for me.

Ally. Jonathan. Alex. Davis. Travis. Tyler. Tyler. Casie. Ciara. Liz.  
And especially you — future Airman Robert Scarveles.

You all saw something in me worth fighting for.  
And I let you down.

1mqc47r,The Day a Special Forces Medic Taught Me How to Control My Anger,"**Part 3: Rage**

Today I decided to stop being afraid of what relapse means to other people.  
I’m done letting their whispered opinions and sidelong glances hold any weight in my recovery. My mental health, my sobriety, my story — they belong to me.

I spent almost four hours sitting in a local smoke shop — the kind most people are afraid to walk into. The kind they’ll judge just by the sign on the window. Inside, there were men already at work. Veterans. People who’ve seen the worst this world can throw at you. Men working quietly in the shadows, because even they’re nervous to be more public about what they’re doing. That’s what stigma does — it keeps people in the dark.

That’s when I met him.  
Picture Guy Fieri — but a lifetime special forces medic, with the stories and scars to prove it. He’s the reason you see kratom “regulated” the way it is today. Not through the FDA. Not through some recovery institution. Through *him*.

As intimidating as he looked, he met my eyes and said something no one else ever had: he’s felt the exact same fits of rage I do — and he’s been able to control them for over 20 years by microdosing mushrooms.

For the first time in a long time, I walked out not just with another substance — but with a plan. A course of action.

Never before has a man looked me in the eyes and told me he’s experienced *exactly* what I feel, and that he knows how to fix it.

Kratom isn’t new to us.  
THC isn’t new to us.  
“Mushroom microdosing” isn’t new to us.

It’s how we’ve been dealing with our issues for years — while also trying our hardest to stay in line with how society thinks we should look.  
Maybe if real mental healthcare in this country was accessible to everyone — truly universal — we wouldn’t have to do it in the shadows.

My rage isn’t just about the past anymore. It’s not just the kind that lashes out and destroys. Now it’s rage at the silence. Rage at the shame we’re told to carry. Rage at the way recovery gets treated like a dirty secret.

I’ve lived with the kind of anger that burns bridges, that isolates, that leaves you ashamed of what you’ve said or done. But this… this is different. This is rage that fuels the fight. Rage that says: *you will not silence me, you will not box me in, you will not tell me how to heal.*",1755203067.0,0,2,addiction,addiction

1mq339o,Blood on the doorframe,"""The Blood on the Doorframe""

I was four when the first storm rolled in—my parents split, and my sense of family was fractured like glass under a boot. I didn't know it then, but some wounds don't bleed on the outside. They sit, quiet and invisible, buried deep in the soul, waiting to surface when the night is too long or the silence too loud.

When I was fourteen, my mom died. That was the second storm. The kind that doesn't just blow through—it camps out, moves in, and names itself Grief. After that, I started calling on forces I couldn't see, just trying to make the pain stop. I was too young to understand what I was really doing, but desperate people will pray to anything that whispers back.

And then came addiction.

It doesn't knock politely at your door. It breaks the hinges, slips in while you're hurting, and convinces you it's a friend. Addiction doesn't care if you're smart, or good-hearted, or raised in church. It just needs you to be tired. And I was.

My wife and I—our addictions were different, but our demons shook hands behind our backs. We had friends who were doctors, construction workers, stay-at-home parents—all with needle tracks hidden under long sleeves or pills stashed in glove compartments. We smiled at each other like everything was fine, but none of us really knew what pain the other was carrying. It didn’t matter. The fix was the only friend we really listened to.

But the truth about darkness is that it hates the light. And eventually, I started craving light again.

There came a day when I looked around and said, ""I can’t live like this anymore."" I wanted to heal. I wanted to breathe without the weight. But when you're used to drowning, the idea of fresh air is terrifying.

I begged her to quit with me. To leave the mess behind and fight for our lives. But healing is a personal decision. You can’t force someone else into freedom. She wasn’t ready. And that broke me in ways no drug ever did.

There are still rumors that float around. Whispers behind hands. Doors that don’t open. Jobs that vanish without reason. People hear your past louder than they see your progress. That’s the devil’s work—he couldn’t kill me, couldn’t steal my faith, so he tries to destroy my name, my peace, my confidence. But let me tell you something:

No weapon formed against me shall prosper.

The enemy thought if he could isolate me, shame me, and bury me in guilt, I’d stop writing. Stop speaking. Stop believing. He knows there’s power in my story, and if I ever realized that, he’d lose a stronghold.

So now I write. I speak. I testify. And I remember what's written over the doorframe of my life—not the blood of my mistakes, but the blood of Jesus Christ.

His mercy is new every morning. Not just the clean mornings or the church-going mornings. Every morning. Even the ones when I still hear echoes of my past. Even the ones when I doubt myself. Even the ones when I’m just holding on by a whisper and a prayer.

See, this life—it’s a war between spirit, soul, and body. Some days, one wins more than the others. But I get up anyway. Because I’m not just fighting for myself anymore—I’m fighting for the ones still stuck. For the ones who don’t believe they’re worth saving. For the ones who think they’ve gone too far or done too much.

You're never too far for grace to reach you.

If you're reading this, hear me: God is not done with you.

You are not your addiction. You are not the rumors. You are not the worst thing you've done. You are a testimony in motion. And no matter what the world says, the blood still covers you.

1mprtmw,Testimony,"Testimony of an Ex-Drug Addict from Port St. Joe, FL
“Save Lives. End Drug Sales.”

My name doesn’t matter. What matters is that I survived — and I’m here to tell the truth.

I'm a former addict. I spent years in the grip of drugs, and what I experienced during that time nearly killed me more than once. I've seen things in Port St. Joe and surrounding towns that most people wouldn't believe — or worse, they ignore. But if no one speaks up, nothing changes.

Every time you go out looking for drugs, you're risking everything:

Getting robbed

Being caught in a violent dispute between dealers

Arrested by police

Exposed to dangerous environments where anything can happen

I’ve walked into houses where I saw women being physically assaulted, where drugs were stashed under kitchen sinks — within reach of children. And when you speak up, the response is anger, threats, or worse. There's no conscience in that world — just desperation and survival.

I tried to escape the cycle. I volunteered at a store near my rehab center and got up every morning to go to McDonald’s — just to avoid my old life. But even then, I saw drug activity hiding in plain sight. Secret meth cliques, suspected sex trade circles. You start to notice things once you’ve lived it.

Drugs don’t care how broke you are — someone will always front you more. Then you're in debt. Then you're delivering. Then you're trapped. You’re no longer using drugs — they’re using you.

I’ve seen:

Girls trade sex for crack in Wewahitchka, only to be exploited and left traumatized

Users cut themselves after being Narcan’d because their “high” was ruined

Cops visiting known drug houses, chatting on couches while deals went down right in front of them (maybe some kind of confidential informant situation) u can't hide forever

People I once respected turn a blind eye — or worse, participate

I’ve overdosed. I’ve vomited, passed out, filled my lungs with fluid, and nearly collapsed them. I’ve fallen so hard from pills that I dislocated my shoulder and split my face open. I’ve seen parents forget they even have kids. And I was one of them — too strung out to raise my own child.

This life destroys more than your body. It wrecks your mind, your soul, your relationships, your future. No one trusts you. You can’t find work. You lose everything.

We need change — real change.
We need:

Education — Not just for teens, but for the whole community

Support for addicts — Real, long-term help, not just punishment

Accountability — For dealers and anyone protecting them

Awareness — Because most people still don’t see how deep this runs

Drugs strip away your freedom in every way — physically, mentally, and emotionally. But recovery is possible. I’m living proof. It’s hard, but it starts with truth. That’s why I’m sharing mine.

1mq27su,Part 2: The Introduction to My Porn Addiction,"**Part 2: The Introduction to My Porn Addiction**

It didn’t happen all at once.  
Nobody wakes up and decides, *“Today I’m going to develop a compulsion that rewires my brain.”*  
It starts small — curiosity mixed with access. Late-night television made it effortless. Just a couple clicks on the remote, no questions asked, no judgmental looks.

I’ve always been told I’m smart and gifted. My gift? Empathy. My flaw? I love too much. I express myself differently than others — though I didn’t know that back then. I remember my first existential crisis at six years old, lying in bed at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City Beach, FL. Oh, you’ve heard this one before? The young Air Force brat who turned to drugs. Shocking.

That night I cried, wondering why humans only get about 100 years — if we’re lucky. I’ve thought about that moment my whole life, and only recently realized it wasn’t the shortness of life that scared me. It was the fear I’d never make something of myself. From then on, I chased the feeling of making people proud of me, like it was oxygen.

One night, while channel surfing, I landed on Playboy. Not the hardcore stuff the internet would later feed me, but enough to make me stop in my tracks. Soft music, women smiling into the camera, moving like they knew you were watching. The way the camera lingered made something inside me click. I didn’t know what I was looking for, but I knew I’d found it.

At first, I told myself it was normal — just being a guy, just blowing off steam. But in the background, something was already changing.

What I didn’t understand then was that it wasn’t just about the content — it was about the escape. Porn became my shortcut to dopamine. Bad day? Watch. Bored? Watch. Stressed? Watch. And every time, the line moved further. The same videos didn’t cut it anymore. I needed something new, something more, something *different*.

That’s how the spiral works.  
It starts as entertainment, becomes a habit, and ends up a reflex. I wasn’t making choices anymore — my brain was. And the more I leaned on it, the harder it was to feel anything from real life. Relationships felt like work. Real intimacy was awkward, slow, and sometimes even disappointing compared to the instant hit I could get alone, in the dark, staring at a screen.

I didn’t see the sleep I was losing, the motivation bleeding out of me, or how it was warping my views on sex, love, and women. All I knew was that I couldn’t stop — or maybe I just didn’t want to stop.

This is what ultimately led to my drug addiction. Something so small, so innocent — just a young man checking out naked ladies.",1755181624.0,0,4,addiction,addiction

1mpwpot,Boyfriend relapsed,"Hi everyone, hoping to get some advice. My (F43) boyfriend (M36) has been in recovery for cocaine addiction and has been clean for a year. 

He was doing well: seemed healthy and stable, working out, going to AA, doing well in his job, positive and upbeat. 

This week he relapsed, and admitted, when it became obvious because he disappeared for two days, that he had used the week before as well. He had gradually stopped going to AA, stopped working out, seemed more disconnected than usual, less reliable, tired all the time, etc. He's now been on another several day binge with limited communication. Hasn't been going to work and has just been holed up at a friend's. Says that when he uses he doesn't eat or sleep for days. Says he is sorry, it's not a reflection of his feelings for me. He isn't able to stay sober for his own child:(  He has been to rehab several times and has been battling this addiction for years. 

I guess the advice I'm looking for is what to say or do. I know there is probably nothing I can do to help but I am sitting here with this horrible feeling of helplessness, watching this man I deeply care for fall back into this darkness. This is a fairly new relationship but we've been very close (I thought) and shared a lot; while sober he was gentle, thoughtful, caring - the kindest guy I've dated. He pursued me, did everything right and seemed head over heels...we clicked and I actually felt this was a serious long-term thing... until this all started. Everyone sane is telling me to just walk away. 

Because of my own history with addiction (sister is an opioid addict) and my very strong feelings for him, it's very hard to do that. 

TL:DR: boyfriend relapsed after a year sober from coke. Was wonderful until he started using again. Has now disappeared for days. Do I just leave? Or try and be supportive somehow? ",1755166976.0,1,3,addiction,addiction

1mpwdww,"My story begins March 18, 2020 — Why I’m finally speaking out about the recovery system","I’ve been in recovery for a while now, and I want to share the story of how it all began for me back in March 2020 — and why I’ve lost trust in the way some recovery programs operate.

On March 18, 2020, I woke up knowing exactly where I was going — and why.  
This was my chance to prove to my loved ones that I could succeed.

Unfortunately, I learned very quickly that many established outlets for recovery weren’t truly there to help, but to exploit and profit off addiction itself.

I had breakfast at a diner near the rehab center, then headed over — shaking with anxiety, restless with excitement. I pulled into the empty parking lot ready to become “normal.”

The next day, a man named George was placed in the bed next to mine, beginning a friendship that lasted my entire stay.

**George’s Story**  
George’s life was the kind you’d expect to see in a movie — but his experiences were painfully real.  
He’d spent his life as a culinary expert, a field where addiction runs rampant: long hours, high stress, endless time away from loved ones.

After decades of hard work, George became an executive chef at a major local establishment known for its incredible dishes. But in order to succeed in that world, you often have to sacrifice everything else — family time, personal health, and balance — just to keep creating.

When you’re constantly away from the people you love, under crushing pressure to maintain perfection, substance abuse can start to feel like the only escape.

**The Pressure**  
Imagine this: you’re passionate about your craft, you *need* to support your family, you want to grow as a person, and you’re determined to keep creating. Now add addiction to the mix.

Our brains are wired differently. The need for control is all we have. If we can’t control our paychecks, our support systems, the stigma tied to our names, or the relationships we’ve built over years — at least we can control our happiness through drugs.

The problem isn’t just the drugs. The problem is that the system in our country is marketed as “the best option for our recovery community” when, in reality, it’s often a revolving door that keeps people addicted while pretending to help.

**The Reality**  
Go ask a nearby addict — the one you might be afraid to even say hello to — how many times they’ve been through rehab.  
If they say “only once,” I call that a win.  
If the answer is multiple times, there’s a reason for that — and it’s not because they love being addicted.

**Why I’m Speaking Out**  
My name is Robert, and for the past five and a half years, I’ve been quietly working on documenting my recovery experiences and the people I’ve met along the way.

Recent events have pushed me to share this earlier than planned.  
I’m done waiting for someone else to stand up for me.

I’m standing up for myself now.

1mpfukr,I quit 7oh but I feel like I’m going to die soon anyways,"Some context. I supervised a dual diagnoses treatment center for kids when I was in my mid 20’s. I never had any issues with addiction but after some years of doing that, I was diagnosed with severe ptsd, anxiety and depression. I quit that job and my therapist gave me 5 different prescriptions that I never got filled. I was afraid of what the medications could do, so I just lived on doing my best. Now, my mom just died. She was the only person I had and she’s gone and it was so traumatic. 

I started taking anything and everything. 7oh is what fucked me up the most. I went through the worst withdrawals and now that’s behind me. 

I bought Xanax off the streets and took 2 bars, drank alcohol and did coke. I did that back to back. Last night I destroyed my house. I broke everything, holes in the ceilings. I have cuts on my arm I should have got stitches for. I fell asleep on broken glass, everywhere. I have always been the person that has helped everyone. This is the first time in my life I’m asking for help. I truly truly truly do not want to be alive anymore. I’m going to close my eyes one night and never wake up again and I’m scared.

Tonight, my mom was on the bathroom floor asleep blocking the door. We got her up, and she isn't OD'ing but is clearly super fucked up and nodding, and it presents exactly like it did with the opiates: slurring, nodding, sentences not making sense, bent at a 90-degree angle, sniffling, and scratching/rubbing at her face. 

She is able to be just coherent enough intermittently to get real bitchy and guilt-trip/lie/defend herself, though, and said she just took more gabapentin than usual. 

I don't take any pain meds myself, so I'm pretty naïve to the effects, but I know that gabapentin *can* be abused, especially if snorted (which historically has been her preferred method).

She's obviously on opiates, right? Or can gabapentin actually get you that high?",1755139220.0,2,9,addiction,addiction
1mq32rz,How I got clean from hard opioids with no withdrawals. Amazing new compound,"To my tribe:

I’ve been working on this write up for a little while because I think its probably the most important post I could make. I have shared my story among my niche community and circle of friends online. Its helped a lot of people already and they've encouraged me to share my story. Hopefully it can help you too.

For  years, I was stuck. My fent use was high  sometimes up to 3g/day IV.  You know the story. Was spending a years salary for some people on something that kept me isolated and locked away from family and friends. Something had to give.  I tried and failed so many times but fents claws go deep.

I’d taper, white-knuckle, relapse… over and over. Suboxone and methadone was just trading one addiction  for another. The mental grip was just as bad as the physical. Even rehab was only a temporary fix. I honestly thought this was going to be my life until the end.

Then I heard about something new in the bio- research community. ""I'm something of a scientist myself"" I’ll just call it SR (not sure about Reddit’s rules on naming). At first, I rolled my eyes, lots of compounds  look good in a research paper but does it actually work in the real world. It sounded too good to be true:

* A compound that reduces tolerance, stops withdrawals, doesn’t get you high, and actually lets your brain heal?*

I always believed  it was only a matter  of time before bio-medical science developed a real treatment for opioid dependence.  

I had followed development on this for awhile 
But the more I read real user stories, real scienctific studies the more I thought: What if this is it, the real we've been waiting for?

When I eventually  spotted it in the wild and actually had the chance to obtain a legitimate sample.


Why SR felt different:
SR is a unique one. It still binds to the same receptors fent does, but it doesn’t trigger the stuff that causes bad withdrawals, crazy tolerance, or dangerous side effects.

No high.

No sedation.

Mild analgesia.

But instant withdrawal relief.

It lets your receptors heal instead of wrecking them. I could go deeper on the science but that's when people's eyes tend to glaze over.

Basically It's a g-protein bias MOR agonist without signaling beta arrestin. So no respiratory depression, OD, no high.

But here is the magic 🎩 : it occupies the receptors without causing desensitization. That is what raises tolerance and causes dependence. Damaging the receptors sites. 

This stuff still satisfies the body's craving, keeps you out of withdrawals, but allows your receptors to heal at the same time. NOTHING else can do that. 

It’s like an off-ramp instead of a trap.

What I did:

Started SR at 50mg twice a day. 

Tapered my fent slowly over 1 week or so.

Increased SR as needed to feel normal.

By the end, I was at 175mg SR 3x/day, zero fent.

Stayed on SR another week, then stopped that too.


I kept waiting for the crash… it never came. No chills, no sweats, no bone-deep exhaustion. Just some occasional sneezing and other minor symptoms. Typical stuff when your clean for several week. Nothing unmanageable. 

For the first time in years, I was free without feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. I seriously couldn't believe it. But its real. 

I’m not saying this is a magic bullet, or that it works for absolutely everyone. You still need to go to meetings or whatever works for you to stay clean. 
 But there are several studies and tons of anecdotal user reports all saying the same thing.
 It’s not a prescription and you won’t find it at CVS or on the street. Do your research first. 
Reach out and I can share some resources to learn more.
I’m living proof that it can be done, and that fent/opioid recovery doesn’t always have to mean weeks or months of hell.

I am not special, just one of many success stories you can find. 

If you’re stuck in that cycle, just know there are new tools out there ….and they’re giving people like us a real chance. Science is finally catching up.
Once this goes mainstream it's going to save a lot of lives. 

Stay strong. You’re worth it. No matter what, don't give up. If this post helps even one person get better it's I'll 

 DMs open if you want to talk. 

Good luck my friends

1mpn6xr,10 Days sober journaling,"Hi. I have never posted on Reddit ever. But I just wrote this journal. I am 10 days sober off meth and I am feeling a lot. My sponsor said this might be good for me. I want to share cause it’s getting overwhelming. Sorry about the second person, I write my journals in them for some reasons I don’t even know. 

August 13th, 2025

Today is 10 days sober. 
It’s raining outside, and you just walked in the rain for about 20 minutes. You can no longer tell the difference between the rain drops, tears or snots. 

Your chest is tight. Face paralyzed. Feel like someone grabbed your collar and lifted you up and won’t let you come down, kinda like a loony tune cartoon. You wonder what this emotions is, ChatGPT tells you that it’s grief. But this is not how you feel at your own grandfather’s funeral, so you are confused and decided to write this down. 

The day you and him became friends it was over a bowl of ramen and a bowl of pork fried rice at TOMO at downtown Evanston 3 minutes away from campus junior year fall. It was a getting to know your new member dinner attempt from you as the president of your college acapella group. And there he was, in a stupid blue Mets hat, chowing down fried rice while you tried to come up with topics to talk about cause you are afraid of silence. 

At TOMO there was a wall of children’s drawings, probably the owners kid. And there was a Superman drawing, awkwardly colored in the center of the wall behind him. 

“Are you a superheros guy?” He didn’t even look up from his bowl or stop chewing, what a barbarian. 

“…. Yes… how do u know”

“You been staring at the Superman drawing.” 

“Yeah. I don’t really tell people but yes, I am a superhero’s guy.” One thing American highschool has taught you was shame. You learned to stop geeking out over men in tights and act “cool”. You started blushing but you also don’t feel like lying cause he is suppose to be your future brother. Talking about not turning your all male acapella group into a frat. 

“That’s great dude, me too! Wanna see my comics?” His eyes lit up. And then that was it. You two stayed in that overpriced Japanese restaurant til it closed. 

And he became your best friend. 

There is 20 more minutes til your NA meeting. You stopped crying already. The rain has dried off on your face, some sweat and tears are still dripping down your cheeks. You wonder if you should share about this “grief” feeling in your chest today but decided not to cause you been sharing a lot at meetings lately and his comment on you being a narcissist that day still stings.

“Wanna be my artist for my comic?” He said one afternoon, in your crowded messy studio apartment senior year. 
“I will be your colorist! I know I am not as good as you in drawing but I am good at all the digital work and I can do backgrounds too! Please say yes.” 

And you said yes. Not cause you wanted to. But cause he asked. 

Then, like a huge star as the burning sun, he brightened your world with stories, concepts, awkward middle school drawings, jokes, pranks, and a dream. Even when he pranked you by giving you three tonic water instead of gin tonic which caused you to throw up for an hour. Even when he told you his biggest fear and you responded “that’s never going to happen, cause you have me.” Even when he ran 2 miles in suit and tie, cursing at you for not telling him about your meth addiction, but still finding you sitting alone at a park where you used to throw frisbee under the moonlight and opened his arms. He lit up your world, effortlessly, handsomely, in a dirty worn blue Mets hat.

“Please let us help you, even Superman needs help, please, Steph, I am begging you.” His face was red, veins popping, you never seen him like this until the intervention 9 days ago. And all you did was turn away your gaze, said the most atrocious thing you ever said to anyone to the boy that you loved so hard you wake up crying from nightmares of him getting hurt in imagined shoot outs at McDonald’s. 

Like a flat out Coca Cola at a college dorm table. The comic hasn’t been touched since. You did a new drawing yesterday to exercise that muscle, but your colorist is no where to be found. 

You had a theory about love once. It’s called the omelette theory, you proudly announced to the room, which was just him and your college cat who died soon after due to feline leukemia. “When you flipped the perfect omelette, you had the urge to go tell someone right? Something so insignificant, so trivial, but you want to tell a person. That’s what love is.” He just lied there on your bed, with your cat on his chest, mis-matched socks, white tank top and gym shorts. “That sounds kinda gay.” He responded with a yawn and you proceeded to hit him with your pillow which spooked the cat. Still, the next day you woke up to a text of a picture of a perfectly flipped waterbottle from him with the caption saying “look bro my waterbottle landed exactly upside down! That’s sick! Right?” 

You stopped caring whether people saw you crying or not since day 4. It’s New York City, nobody gives a shit. The meeting is about to start. Time to wrap it up, you whispered to yourself. The lobby of the center is warm, feels safe, like that studio apartment you two shared years ago.

So this is grief. Your sun is gone. You pushed him away, you reached his limit, you ruined it. There is no more tan boy in the afternoon sun with a freshly colored superhero page or texts about perfectly flipped waterbottle. All that’s left, it’s you, the rain, 10 days sobriety, and the picture of you two in suits standing in front of the Superman movie poster that you saved as your screensaver before the relapse. 

You stood up. Wipe the tears off your face. Adjust the worn blue Mets hat that he gave you at your graduation. Gotta go to the meeting now. One day at a time.

(This is the hat, it’s hideous right? I wore it so much it has only gotten grosser)

This morning I felt restless, pacing around like I was supposed to be doing something. But everything my brain offered as a “something” was just a route back to gambling. I hadn’t realized how deeply it’s wired into my routine even just sitting at my laptop can be a trigger. I worked through a rehab worksheet today that asked me to list what gambling has taken from me. The list was long: my job, my savings, the trust of the people closest to me, my ability to enjoy everyday moments without obsessing over odds. It was sobering. I talked to my mom this afternoon.

I know addiction is STRONG in my family. My mom’s side was all addicted to narcotics, alcohol, smoking. I’m scared just to take ibuprofen two days in a row because I saw what addiction does and know I never want to go through it. I had surgery and was prescribed Percocet for a week following. I took one pill after my surgery and dumped the rest down the drain because I would rather suffer short term pain than long term addiction. I don’t know how to tell if I’m getting addicted to something. I have severe insomnia due to ptsd and was put on klonopin (a benzo) and I felt like I relied too much on that even though on it I still couldn’t sleep well so I dumped those down the drain too. I refuse to keep alcohol in the house because I’m scared of the “I had a rough day I need a drink” becoming a daily mentality. I only use marijuana on my days off but I work two jobs so I only have a day off once every 3 ish months and there are a lot of days I wish I took more days off so I could get high and relax more often.

1mpk20k,Am I wrong for cutting off with my addicted cousin completely?,"My cousin is 3 years older than me (I’m 21, he’s 25). His life has been messy from the start — his mom passed away when he was a teenager, his dad left long before that. He grew up without much guidance and fell into drugs and trouble early on. Although family provided everything for school and other needs but he was a rebel. 

He’s never been someone who works hard or tries to improve himself. All he does is complain and manipulate people to get what he wants. A year ago, our extended family pooled money to send him to the Gulf so he could work, save up, and maybe get married. Instead, he kept using drugs there, didn’t go to work for a year, and only worked occasionally to buy more drugs.

Eventually, he complained again and wanted to come back. The family again paid for his ticket. Now he’s back here, same old behavior. My mom, aunts, and uncles still include him in family events, but I just ignore him. I don’t speak to him, and I don’t want anything to do with him because he’s toxic and always says nice things but does the opposite.

Even today, he said he was hungry. I just made my own dinner and juice and went to my room without giving him anything. I know it sounds harsh, but I’ve reached my limit. Whatever you give him, he wastes it, and he never changes.

I was bad with liquor(vodka 100proof) for the last few years. I recently stopped drinking due to a pregnancy, I lost the baby and the relationship I was in. It killed me and my only escape is substances. I hate dealing with the emotions that come with it. The liquor didn’t help the emotions anymore, I’ve never felt so depressed and angry/hurt. I turned to something stronger which is cocaine, it numbs everything better. I don’t want to be like this though. My family knew about my alcoholism, they helped me with it. They were used to it, it runs in the family you can say. I know if I ask them for help with this new addiction it will destroy them. I don’t even think I have the courage to tell them. There are days my mom will look at me and be say “are you drinking again?”. I tell her no because it’s the truth but I feel shitty knowing she thinks I’m doing ok.

i’ve been there , unbeknownst to me, they were having a sober day (never told me) because of a court appearance the following day. 

and they were on absolute demon time. screaming at me for 8 hours , abusive as fuck. i was an absolute irritant , my presence alone. there was nothing i could do right it was just all wrong. 

it got so bad i had a fucken panic attack and actually vomited on myself and then from profusely apologizing and trying to clean everything they went more volatile

they’ve invited me over to hang out , and they’ll drink , i don’t typically sleep with friends but we ended up fucking before , and at one point in the morning they said “ when did we go to (room in the house) “ i felt disgusting as if I did something wrong , they blacked out at some point WHILE we were being intimate and then they became cognizant 

(obviously to preface we’re both grown consenting adults and they’re aware we’ve fucked and it’s a non issue. it was just really fuckedup to me that they , literally mentally tapped out at some point then ??? that’s so creepy ) 

there’s so much else to it that’s literally a massive red flag saying 
“ why did you hang around them so long if it was never enjoyable “ 

and i just put too much faith in people from losing so many friends. we also had way too many similarities which drove us to a point that we were like, this is too weird. i think ultimately we’re far too similar (they aren’t entirely a peace of shit - but i can’t stand in the way of being abused and belittled and then it turns out they’ve blacked out and don’t remember )


sorry this is so long.

I have such a good life, I have the most perfect boyfriend in the world, I have a roof over my head, I have two jobs, I start my junior year of college in a week. Everything is perfect but I am addicted to weed.

And it makes me so depressed because I can’t even tell my boyfriend about it because he doesn’t know how bad it is. He would be so upset with me if he knew how bad it is.

 I literally don’t know what to do with myself. I need it to sleep, I need it to not be angry, I need it to be social. It is a vicious cycle and I just can not break it, I have tried so hard to break it but I can really only go about three or four days before I end up breaking the streak and it gets bad all over again.

Like I said earlier I have a roof over my head but I also live with my friend who I smoke with constantly, that is what we do to hang out and when I stop smoking weed she gets upset with me. This is another stressed to the vicious cycle I mentioned earlier.

I have two jobs do I am constantly working, I miss so much sleep because of weed. I try to stop smoking so I end up staying up until 4am and then I smoke weed to fall asleep and I over sleep. This affects my performer work. Sometimes I even have to wake and bake to make it to work and function.

My boss and boyfriend can both tell something is up. They are always saying how I seem tired and unemotional. I feel so unmotivated for everything because of weed. 

At this point I’m just ranting because I’m high and I can’t sleep. If anyone has some advice to help that would be amazing because I’m kinda at the end of my rope.

1molstq,"I know I’m an addict, I just really don’t care","(22y/o trans woman) 2025 has been one of the worst years possible for me. I have severe OCD and it came back this year. Previously I had an issue with prescription stimulants (adderall, vyvanse, focalin) and alcohol but really my issue is I will do anything and any drug to get high. Now, with my mental state being so shit my use has been steadily ramping up for the past six to eight months; to the point that I was finishing 3-4 handles of vodka a week in April, alone in my room. 

Recently, I’ve gotten back into doing vyvanse. The comedown really rocks my world in terms of intensity because I tend to compulsively redose and stay up for long periods of time. I’ve also gotten into that 7OH shit so it tends to compound my usage of drugs along with the daily drinking. 

I know I’ve been an addict for a long time, it’s just so hard to care when my sober mind is literally my worst enemy. I know I should hate this, but I really don’t. I see it as my cost of living being dealt a shitty hand.

1mok89l,"Looking for advice / your experience - not long after my last post getting really high last Wed night, I crashed out, I think it was around 3am (Thurs) at this point and was out cold on the floor - I don’t think I fell. Next thing I know I was woken by paramedics at 7pm so approx 14 hours out cold","Even though i couldn’t stand up or walk at all I couldn’t think straight - I felt rough and fuzzy headed and just wanted them to leave. 

Basically after they checked my vitals etc and advised i go with them to the hospital due to high BP, dilated pupils, sweats etc. I still refused to go with them for various reasons. I believe they left my home around midnight and I fell back to sleep on the couch. I have the BP numbers etc if it helps with any advice (I just don’t understand them)

Basically my calves and feet are no better whatsoever still can’t stand up / support my own weight and are still swollen and (my thigh on one leg is extremely swollen and the hip aches all day). I know it’s my own fault and should have simply gone with them whilst they were here but I have issues with leaving my apartment. 

The point of my post is to ask, has anyone else had a similar issue with legs / feet etc? 

I’ve had similar feelings after crashing out on the floor numerous times but always wears off after a day at the most - this is getting close to 5-6 days with no change.  You’ll see from my last post the cocktail if that makes a difference - I feel normal in myself and simply asking if anyone has has this recover without having to go to the hospital, it’s just something I don’t want to do and would struggle to get out of my top floor apartment alone, let alone15 miles to a hospital for who knows how long. 

Simply wondering if anyone has had limb issues or if you know a way to resolve them? Otherwise, I know I’ll have to go - I’m just worried about what damaged has been done seeing as it’s gotten no better in close to a week.

1mor3bs,Questions about inpatient treatment,"Hi all, my ex/long-term friend (42m) had a really bad relapse for the last 4 months, he has been an opiate user stemming originally from chronic pain but there is tons of childhood trauma and a long history of depression as well. He relapsed and I broke up with him however he is now smoking fentanyl and crack. He is transitioning to suboxone but not well as he keeps going into nasty withdrawal and a few days ago I had to call the ambulance. 

I finally let his sister and all friends and his landlord know the situation as I can’t manage this on my own nor should I have to. We are all united that he has to accept help and go to treatment but I know he also has to want to get clean. His sister has kindly offered to pay for private treatment (we are in Toronto) and we have found a place that will take him soon. His landlord (surrogate father), sister and I will be sitting him down and giving him the option of treatment or he will be kicked out of his place and I won’t be in his life anymore in any capacity, it’s his choice. 

My question is for those who found themselves in similar situations (treatment or else) what made the biggest impression on you/what did you find was the best approach? Tough love or compassion? I’m a very gentle compassionate person so the tough love is difficult for me but I will do whatever is best for my boundaries and for his health. Any advice is appreciated.

Side note: his landlord loves him dearly but he hasn’t paid rent/worked in months and has almost burned the place down nodding off while smoking so I can understand his position of wanting him out if he doesn’t get help",1755048165.0,2,8,addiction,addiction

I have been looking into inpatient detox for about a month now trying to find someone who would accept me into their detox. I also have Medicare so my options are limited. Medicare won't pay for detox if you're only detoxing off of cocaine. Which, despite speaking to at least half a dozen trearment centers who all said they wouldn't accept me, no one mentioned to me that it was because Medicare wouldnut pay for it. Which I confirmed with Medicare, and I'm just learning about all this today.

However, if you are also detoxing off an opioid, benzo, or alcohol in addition to cocaine then Medicare would cover it and my nearest inpatient detox would accept me. So, I'd have to go off the Xanax I've been on for about 10 years and detox off of that and coke at the same time. But, they said they'd give me Ativan for withdrawal management. I think it's a little silly for them to detox me off a benzo using a different benzo. My Bipolar and Panic Disorder makes it hard for me to be in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people, so if there was ever a time I'd really need my Xanax it would be while I'm in detox, especially when just starting it. 

Idk what the hell to do. I know what the best choice is but I'm really struggling with it. They said i could resume taking my Xanax after I'm discharged from detox. So, I'd basically have to detox off of Xanax in order to get Medicare to cover my detox from cocaine. What would you do? What are your thoughts? I'm just curious as to how others might handle this situation. ✌️",1755024769.0,1,6,addiction,addiction

Now my life is doomed and I don't know what I can do anymore, I'm scared that I am undeveloped and am scared about my future as well.

I'm also trying to stop it, but completely getting rid of it or taking long breaks from it increases my anxiety and sense of failure, not to mention that I started using pc since I was... wayyyy younger, though I focused more on life, but still...

1mnxmmd,Left my addict boyfriend,I didn’t know where to post or why but I feel like getting something off of my chest. I joined this sub about a year ago while dealing with my coke addict ex boyfriend. He always said it was recreational but every single weekend it consumed him. Starting every Friday night through Saturday just stopping shy of Sunday to be good for the week…there were so many roller coasters that happened that I never really tied to the drug mostly because he acted like he was so in control of it. Now looking back it’s like he was a shell of a person sometimes…sometimes angry sometimes apologetic…sometimes paranoid. If anyone is on this sub is dealing with feeling like you were gaslit or dismissed all of the time you’re not alone. I stayed for 2.5 years thinking that he really just had a minor habit and now I realize our entire relationship was around this drug. I was constantly a nervous wreck trying to navigate it and thought there was something wrong with me for questioning things he would forget about or feeling like I was overreacting when he would suddenly say something so mean and out of character. I know you may think you can love someone through this but it has destroyed me. I even question if I did the right thing…please reconsider dating someone with an addiction. ,1754968212.0,9,9,addiction,addiction
1mo1lmt,Mom stealing money from cash app,Idk if its a good idea to kick my mom and her boyfriend out of my apartment. My mom stole around $1500 from my cash app to use for gambling while I was asleep. 25 to $60 at a time over several months. I did  realize she took money but have been questioning my self like maybe I just do not remember giving her some money but last week end she took money three times in one night equalling around $200 and realized something was up. I brought it up to her and she let me think I was getting scammed so I put in a fraudulent request. Cash app determined I was making fake claims and disappled my account. I told my mom and she owned up to being addicted to gambling and admitting to taking the money. So I kicked her out of my house to live with my dad for now. She felt hella bad but my break of trust was to massive to let her stay. But I'm wondering if that was better or worse to help her addiction.

1mo98mr,A poem I wrote about addiction,"
I forget when it started to take over. Maybe it was always there

I was seeking shelter, comfort but later I was looking for answers 

The way it spoke to me I can never forget 
Like an old friend, like a mother, like a spirit 
Devine and peaceful. “Come to me, I won’t hurt you, you’ll be okay”

I felt the arms of addiction wrap around me, first like a hug, later like a strangle

I can’t make sense of it, the further I go the more I become lost 

The cords in my brain are tangled, my wires are crossed

The grip of addictions wrapped tightly around them

It starts to hollow you out, replacing your essence with its own 

First it lies to you, then you lie to yourself and then you lie to your loved ones 

You feel you’re one step away from true understanding of all things 

You feel you’re the exception to the rule. 
The one who can dance with the fire and not burn out.
You’ll catch yourself under a tree, sun flickering through the branches to caress your skin

You’ll find yourself by the ocean, staring out, feeling comforted by insignificance 

You’ll look up to the stars, each feeling like a kiss from the universe

And still turn your back on it all for that deluded comfort. 

You’re defected, defeated, delusional and deceived. 

One day you will hug yourself a final time.

1mo974s,Alcohol and weed connection,"Hi I am an alcoholic 26 y.o. I am currently quitting drinking , but this is for another topic . When I was 18-20y.o. and I still wasn't an alcoholic when I smoked weed I used to feel very good , only laughing good times with friends , positive vibrations , but as the time passed by and I became an alcoholic , when I smoking weed I get anxiety , negative thoughts feeling panic became antisocial and nothing good. If I first get drunk and than smoke ( a little ) weed the best I get Is that I am feeling relaxed physically and still I want to stay alone .


Soo my question is:

When I fully stop drinking alcohol , if smoke weed can I enjoy it like when I wasn't an alcoholic , and if yes , how much time must I be sober before I can enjoying weed again?


If someone have similar experience to mine , I will accept any advice , thank you brothers

1mnehyy,Absolutely shattered....my life has been a lie,"My (F/60) husband (M/63) has struggled with alcoholism for the entire 25 years of our marriage.  At least, I thought it was alcoholism.  I apologize...this is a lot to unpack so this post is a long one.  
  
I realize I am and have always been an enabler.  My father was an alcoholic.  My mother had a free-basing cocaine addiction for several years.  I took care of both of them, as a child and as a teen, by cleaning up/hiding it, caring for my younger siblings, working 3 part-time jobs through high school to keep a roof over our heads and food in my siblings' bellies.  I thought I was a hero.  I was just an enabler, even though I was doing what I thought I should and doing the best of my ability to keep us out of Childrens Aid.  I understand that now.

My husband was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer (now in remission but still just a time bomb because this type of cancer WILL wake up), lost his father for whom we did all the at-home palliative care, and lost his mother for whom we also did all the at-home palliative care......all in the past 3 years.  

Having lost both of my parents (alcoholism/brain cancer) I understand the nature of grief and tried gently to invite him to therapy with me.  He is a boomer and a man so his ""therapy"" was packing it down real tight with alcohol.  Or so I thought.  I became the designated driver and the fix-up-the-mess-er and the person how managed the house and the finances and held down a stressful but meaningful job, and acted as our general contractor for our build of a small retirement home......while he was retired/disabled because of the nature of his cancer.  

His behavior over the past 2 months has become more and more bizarre, escalating exponentially.  I worried that it might be that his cancer had metastasized to his brain as some of his behaviors were similar to my mom's.  I thought it might be a interaction between the handsful of meds he's on.  Every time we made an appointment with our GP or his oncologist, he would somehow hurt himself and be unable to make the appointment.

It all came crashing down 6 days ago when I found a baggie of crystal meth that fell out of the fanny pack he wears all the time.  

Cue the lying and deflection and counter-blaming and pleading and begging and promises.....

I told him he can't live in my home while an active user and addict.  That I have his back whenever he chooses the path of detox, rehab, and active recovery.  That I will do everything in my power to support that choice if he makes it.  And that I cannot follow him down any other path.

I have cancelled our build and working with my subcontractors to try to salvage what can be salvaged and to protect the build over the coming winter.

I am now discovering that he has been a relatively-functional meth addict (smoking) for what sounds like several years.  That he has been selling his pain meds and fronting goods for a local drug dealer to fund his habit.

I don't know how to move forward.  He only likely has 5 years IF he gets sober and clean....I fear he only has a year if he continues to use.  He will be on the street, probably not taking the medication that keeps his cancer in remission as long as possible, My kids are grown and out of the house, one in university and one in full-time employment.  

I don't know what to do.  I don't know what I hope for with this post, other than hearing about others' experiences with an addicted spouse and how I can support him with unconditional love (even after the lying and betrayal) without being burned in the dumpster fire he has created.

I can't imagine being able to ever trust him again.  I don't think I want to be married to him any more.  I am in short-term counselling through my EAP, and seeking long term counselling to understand how to navigate and fix the defects in myself that prevented me from seeing/accepting what my gut was telling me.

I am 60 years old and have ""taken care"" of addicts my entire life.  I may have 25 years left on this planet, and I don't want to spend them living for someone else.

This fucking drug.  The people it destroys.

I am a firm believer in restorative justice and have never supported capital punishment either ethically nor as effective social policy.

Now, I would gladly stand in line as they put meth manufacturers up against the wall.",1754922508.0,59,4,addiction,addiction
1mo7cqh,weed sober as a minor (I know),"I’m not sure if this will get taken down since I’m 17, but I wanted to share somewhere since I don’t really have anyone I can tell irl. I started smoking when I was about 14 because of a boyfriend who had been smoking since he was in single digits. (I know) He had an older cousin who smoked all day every day so, of course, he didn’t even really get ‘high’ anymore, and I remember telling myself when I started smoking that I would never let myself get to that point. But of course we broke up about a year and a half later, and by that point I couldn’t even really feel three hits from his bong.

When we did break up it was hard because I didn’t really have friends, and the ones I did have didn’t really reach out after I tried meeting up, so it didn’t feel worth pursuing. I regret a lot of that part of my life, mainly that I put so much into a middle school relationship (transferred into high school) But anyway by that point I just felt really alone (still do) and turned to smoking weed. Since I obviously didn’t want my parents knowing, I mainly stick to pens and dispos. There’s a lot of stuff that happened that I don’t have to get into, but basically my dad found everything.

That was a bit over a year ago. For context (before this past month), I don’t remember the last time I had gone through a full day sober. Most days I’d just wake up and hit my pen. The worst part is by the time I was by myself constantly (I do online classes), the weed wasn’t even doing anything. If anything I’d feel a slight buzz for 5 to 10 minutes but then it’d just be a sort of dopamine crash (not that intense though). I was smoking some weird ass stuff though, like buying from websites that don’t card (I know) and smoking non-FDA approved stuff. Honestly, even just feeling like I had something is I think what kept me sane. I don’t want it to feel like the breakup caused the addiction, the timing was just felt incredible since my parents also started discussing separating around that exact time.

This was 2023 and it genuinely doesn’t feel like two years have passed. To be honest, I still feel like I should be 14. Not mentally, and I’ve definitely grown and changed as a person so I don’t exactly know how to describe it. More like everyone is moving on with their lives and having new beginnings and accomplishments and I’m still trying to beat something that people say you can’t even get addicted to (liars). I just can’t believe I’ll be a legal adult next year. I apologize this is so long I just want to get it off my chest. Anyway, about three weeks ago now I realized just how much time I’ve essentially wasted.

Everyone my age is going out, hanging out with friends while I do my pet sitting jobs and sit in my room smoking from a battery that’s hurting my lungs and development. After my dad found my stuff I told him I’d quit, but I knew I couldn’t then. I actually started drinking a bit before he caught me so I took it as a sign to stop drinking, and just smoke. That was last year. This means I’ve been smoking almost daily for about three years. This past month I realized just how unhappy I am (there are many factors tbh) and that theres no way I can expect to just magically feel better while doing the exact same things for years straight.

For more context I guess, I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression and was privileged enough to grow up in a family thats very understanding of that. Even when my dad found out he said he was there to support me, and they always have. If anything, that’s what makes it so hard to know that I’m lying to them. They think (or at least my dad thinks) that I’ve been sober for at least a few months. It kills me that I lied to him so much and technically still am. I wish so badly that I could tell them that I genuinely am sober now and talk to them about it, but I can’t. I know it’s my fault for prioritizing my boyfriend when I should’ve kept up with friends as well, but I always just thought ‘if they aren’t reaching out to me to hang out, they probably just don’t want to hang out’, so I just stuck with him.

I didn’t mean for this to sound super revolved around him, honestly I don’t think about him much anymore, but I do think the breakup and my isolation had a lot to do with my addiction. I apologize again that this is so long and I truly appreciate anyone who read all of it. I really did just need to talk about it somewhere I guess. Thank you to anyone who listened.

1mmtfb9,Two years,"The first photo was taken two years ago. It was a few days after drunkenly falling face-first UP the staircase and six months before I would be admitted to the psychiatric ward as a direct result of my alcoholism. I was twenty seven. 

The second photo was taken last month, it was at an open-mic night and I’m in the middle of telling the crowd about this very cringe story from my teenage years where I brought a Ouija board into school. Everyone laughed, and I drank lime water for the night and laughed at everyone else’s performances, and then I went home to my house-share, ate a Reeses bar, and went to bed to go to work the following day. I am twenty nine. 

Out of all the things I had to do in life, getting sober was the toughest. I remember breaking down in the hospital when they told me that I should consider treatment. I kept saying that I didn’t want to turn twenty eight in rehab, a nurse kindly took the time to say “whether you do or don’t, you’ll be turning twenty eight anyway”. I did turn twenty eight in a treatment centre and I think it might have been the best birthday I had. 

My family love me, but they couldn’t help me the way I needed help. They would have turned the world upside down for me and gone through it all themselves ten times over, but none of it would have worked unless I wanted it for myself. I didn’t want it in the beginning. I didn’t want to be me in the beginning. And I didn’t get to like being me overnight, some days I still struggle with it.  

It’s been two years since I was in the hospital. From the hospital to a twelve-week treatment programme, then onto a six month sober-living house. Now I house-share with a very sweet couple, they know nothing about my past, it’s not that I’m ashamed, but it’s hard to find a place to live in Ireland and I tried to keep things as simple as they needed to be when I was looking to rent. I got a job, I’ve been working, showing up every day, and still grateful to have the opportunity to do simple things like own a set of keys, make a coffee in the canteen, chat with my colleagues on my breaks about mundane crap that feels like chicken soup for the soul. 

I earn way less than what I did two years ago, but I never had a penny to my name to show for it. This is the very first year I actually have savings. I’m learning to drive, I failed my first driving test just two weeks ago, but I booked it again that very same evening and I’ll keep working at it until I get it. I go to AA meetings, I’m agnostic for the most part but it’s the people there that keep me coming back. Some days I walk into a meeting and I have a mental list as long as my arm about all my personal grievances, and by the time it gets to my turn to share, I just feel gratitude to be get to be there. 

I got to see my brother get married last year, I go home to visit my mum and dad and I get to be there for them as a daughter. I have friends and more importantly, I can be a friend. 

I’m still a bit mad, even without the drink, you can take the alcohol out of the fruitcake but you still have a fruitcake! If you’ve read this far, I just want to say, it’s worth it, it’s worth it, it’s so, so worth it. It’s hard, it takes a village, but there is absolutely no such thing as a hopeless case. I believe that from the very core of my soul. You’re so worth it.

I should have never been put on it in the first place. All the reading I’ve done says it’s hard to get off of. It’s make me have no emotions at all anymore I don’t feel like myself.

1mnyoow,i’m lost,"hey everyone, this is my first time posting so i hope i’m following the rules and guidelines! please let me know if anything in this goes against anything and i’ll try fix it :)

i’ve struggled with addictions since i was about 10 (2017). i didn’t start with drugs or alcohol but instead s/h. i stayed with that for 6-7 years before finally trying to stop. (i’m now over 6 months free). i first tried drugs in november 2021 after being released from a ward (where i was staying due to extreme mental health struggles) when i was 14, and have had issues ever since. i was popping oxys like candy for a few months before i lost contact with the people who supplied me with it. i then moved on to alcohol. for around 8-9 months, i would be black out drunk by 9:30 every morning. i was still attending school at this point, and it was seriously affecting my education. 

a couple of months after i turned 15, my parents found out about my drinking and forced me to stop. for 4 months, i was completely sober for the first time in almost a year. when i stopped drinking, i went back to s/h, which was slowly getting worse. skip forward to january 2023, when i was 4 months clean from alcohol. two of my old friends showed up and offered me drinks and weed. i took it, because i was struggling with extremely dark thoughts and knew the escape that would come with relapse. i started drinking again, but less this time, and started smoking weed occasionally. i followed this for most of 2023, with the occasional relapse on oxy. 

end of 2023, my boyfriend of the time ended things with me and my smoking and drinking increased drastically. march 2024, i got in contact with someone who sold things i’d never tried before. over the course of 2 weeks, i tried it all. i started with mdma, which i loved more than i should’ve, but then i moved on to xanax. i was popping at least 2 a day for a few weeks before i nearly overdosed, which scared me enough to stop for a little bit. i had only been taking them for a few weeks, so withdrawls weren’t too bad. i kept smoking, slowly increasing how often. in june 2024, i got diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and bpd. 

i stuck by smoking and s/h for a few months before i got into a fwb with my coworker. he was not a bad person, but he was quite enabling when it came to usage. we would smoke together almost every day, and would often take mdma, acid, and ket. during the 6 months that we were fwb, i slowly started using mdma more and more, going behind his back to do it and on a few occasions i took some of his from his room to take by myself. i was smoking about 28g of weed every week and a half, and taking md maybe once or twice a week. 

october 2024 is when i started using md more and more. from this time through to march this year, i increased from one or two a week, to every other day, to everyday, and finally taking multiple every day. sometime in early march, i brought a bag of what i thought was md, but was meth. i then started using meth for about a month before nearly overdosing and i flushed out the last of my supply (i think the only thing that stops me from furthering one addiction is almost dying). i stopped taking md as well, and went back to just smoking. by this point in time i was in such a horrific state that it was genuinely like i couldn’t form a proper thought. i don’t know if it was due to my mental health or the excessive use. 

less than a month later, i started doing ket again. it was offered to me at a party, and i said yes. i started taking acid again as well. april was the month i did acid the most. i would take a tab every 3-4 days, and i convinced myself that it was healthy. in the final week of april, i ended up going through 14 tabs in 5 days and finally realised that i needed to stop. i was still using ket every now and again, but that wasn’t at the point to call it anything other than something i do on a night out. 

may, i went back to smoking weed and doing the occasional line of ket. then june comes around, and i relapse on md. i went on a two week bender before having one of the worst mental breakdowns of my life and i told myself i could keep doing it, but only occasionally. my ket usage increased, and soon i was doing it daily. by mid july, i was going through a gram a day. my parents found my stash, and we got into a massive fight. i stopped doing ket then, because seeing my mum in tears just asking ‘why’ broke something in me. i kept taking md occasionally, just in social settings. 

i met my now boyfriend a little while ago, and i’ve tried to get sober to be there for him lately. i’m almost a month off ket, over 2 weeks free from md, and 2 and a half months off acid. i still smoke weed, but i go through a gram every few days, so i have significantly cut down. 

while i can recognise that this is good for me, i have genuinely never been worse. it feels as though my ability to think has barely come back, leaving me making dumb decisions because i genuinely am unable to think things through. i am surrounded by people who love me, and yet i feel so isolated and unable to be understood. i feel as though i am loosing my best friend, who met me and has stayed with me through the past year and a bit of addictions. i am seriously struggling in school, due to my mental health, lack of sleep, and inability to get anything done in class. i have never had a good relationship with my father, but it’s slowly been getting worse, and is now at the point where my mom has told me i should go no contact once i move out. i have an ongoing police investigation trying to convict my ex friend who s/a me on new years, and i can’t escape from any of it by getting high. 

i don’t know what to do anymore. i started using drugs as a way to get through dark patches in my mental health, and they have kept me from suicide so many times, but now i don’t know how to live without them. they’ve cost me so much, but i genuinely dont think i’ll make it without them. i need help and i feel so alone. i don’t know what to do anymore.

1mnezwq,6 Months Clean — Here’s What’s Kept Me Going,"Six months ago, I was at rock bottom. Every day revolved around getting high, and I honestly didn’t believe I’d ever stop. I thought the cravings would kill me before withdrawal did.

The first week was hell. The shakes, the sweats, the nightmares, all of it made me want to give up. But I told myself, just get through today. Some days I made it by the hour, not the day.

Here’s what’s helped me:

Cutting ties with everyone I used with.

Keeping busy, even if it’s just cleaning or walking.

Talking to people who actually understand.

Writing down how bad it was so I don’t forget.

1mnwv6p,Day one,"(Throwaway account) I’m a F (31), who hasn’t had addiction issues until recently. I grew up watching my siblings ruin their life with addiction issues (opiates mostly, but they did the whole nine yards). I obviously knew I did not want any part of that. For health / mental issues as a kid, I was prescribed some really hard medication (like Xanax), and I never really had a say, but was able to come off of them easily. Alcohol, I like to drink socially. There has been times where I might have some drinks after work, but I like to keep it pretty minimal in general, always have. I always felt like I had a really strong hold and self awareness on when to stop, or just overall never getting addicted to anything. My strongest addiction before was cigarettes, and was able to quit those with just maybe a few rough days.

I always told myself I would never try ❄️, because I would like it too much. I didn’t try it until I was 30, and I maybe did it three times within a year - but never felt the pull to go back to it or “keep going”. Three months ago, my partner got some for a special event and I had fun yada yada, and that’s where everything went downhill. I started wanting to do it every weekend, which led to maybe every night, which ultimately led to a few bumps during the day to do simple tasks, and waiting for “party mode” each weekend - for three months. I found myself having no will to do the simplest things around the house without a little bump first. My nose has taken a hit (no hole yet), because I was a idiot who never researched after or during care, mental health at a all time low, and feeling like something so minimal has a whole control of my life. 

It feels good just venting and writing this, honestly. Today I was clean (I’ve gotten to nine days before), and just rotted on the couch not doing too much. I know I’m strong and stubborn, so I need to just focus on getting to that uphill point before my life just becomes ruined outside my mental health. ",1754966039.0,1,1,addiction,addiction

1mnmkq1,sometimes I wonder if it’ll ever get better,"im clean now, except for the occasional weed use here and there to manage chronic pain. I’ve been clean for 2+ years now, but the guilt still eats away at me. when I was struggling the most with my use, I severely hurt my best friend of around 6 years (who was also my only close friend) because of some things I said that were deeply hurtful, and made them feel like I was blaming them for everything (which was never my intention, I just very poorly communicated my thoughts at the time and what matters is the way it was perceived and the effect it had). 

sometimes I question if the guilt and self hatred will ever get better. I still think about this person every day. I have reached out and apologized, and they said they appreciated it but weren’t sure if they wanted to be friends again which i understand. I can’t stop crying and im not sure why. it’s silly, but the thing making me want to relapse the most is suffering the consequences of actions I engaged in while in active addiction. I know deep down I don’t want to relapse or go back to that life, but sometimes it feels like it’s easier to do that than keep pushing forward.

I know im still young and have a lot ahead of me. I’ll be turning 21 soon. but I already feel so tired of life. I’ve always struggled with making friends and since I’ve lost that friendship I feel like I haven’t really made any new close friends. I just feel like a shell of the person I used to be. I miss my friend a lot, but I don’t hold her cutting me off against her at all, I understand why she did it. 

None of my family knows about any of this, because I managed to keep up my grades and mask the addiction for the most part.
When I first started trying to get clean, I thought the withdrawals would be the hardest part. But in truth, it’s seeing the mess I created and realizing how many people I hurt once I was sober enough to see it. It’s like suddenly finding yourself outside a burning building, only to realize you were the one holding the lighter the entire time.

1mnazkw,getting back on prescription stimulants for my severe ADHD almost ruined my life,"I've taken stimulants since I was 8 because of my ADHD. It has never really done anything but improve my executive function throughout the day and I genuinely found it helpful. After the big national shortage, I stopped taking it for a year and recently asked for a refill since I heard it was back in stock. I take a generally high dosage so I vaguely assumed that the doctor would have me eased back on and work my way up to the dose I had previously.

 When I asked to be put back on the meds since the shortage was over, she immediately refilled the script from when the shortage started without any questions, discussions, or even warnings about any side effects. The only thing I had to do was get a 5-minute EKG so she wouldn't be responsible if I ended up getting hurt because I had heart problems. Once the results came back and my heart was fine as expected, she sent me on my way. I should have asked more questions and advocated for myself, but I shrugged it off and assumed she knew what she was doing (huge mistake). 

The first day I took it my pupils got huge, I started getting chills, and my heart was starting to race. within a couple hours I had convinced myself spirits where trying to warn me of these horrors that had happened at this small beach I used to explore growing up. I started getting paranoid and by the middle of the night a was pressed against a corner in my room so I wouldn't have to keep franticly checking behind me. Genuinely had a full blown tweak out like nothing I have ever experienced before. But as I was coming down, I started to have this fear that if I didn't have my medication figured out by college (a week or so from now), I would fail out and disappoint everyone I loved.

I was stupid enough to take it the second day because I was convinced I needed to figure this out. I thought if I stuck through the ""initial reaction"" my body had, maybe I would be functioning again. big mistake. It didn't make me freak out like before but I started remembering these horrible things from my past and convinced myself none of my friends actually cared about me. I didn't reach out to my partner or my family either because ""I just needed to get through the initial reaction"". All I wanted was to function at a basic level again. 

By day three I was genuinely so paranoid and angry and sad at everyone around me. I thought that they saw how badly I was struggling and they didn't care. Realistically I just wasn't reaching out because of the spiral I was having, but I didn't know that. I kept craving more and I was so close to taking another pill when I had this moment of clarity. I was already craving substance abuse, and I hated my reaction to the pills. I always assumed addiction was caused because the drug made you feel better, and that the craving I felt wasn't the start of addiction because I hated how these drugs made me feel. 

I have severe impulse control and If I hadn't realized what was happening, I wouldn't have even known to stop myself. I gathered all the pills and I gave them to my parents. I hated it so bad, and I even stood in the hallway for a bit because of how bad I was dreading it. In the end I surrendered them, but it's terrifying to think how badly that could have gone. If I had taken a fourth day of that medication I have a feeling I would have started a path that would ruin everything I've worked for.

I’ve never been to treatment but last summer a psychiatrist dropped me as a patient bc she thought i had BPD and wasn’t going to get any better with her…and no one in my family knows it’s something my therapist is recommending rn either.

I didn’t before him but i really can’t help but think I am okay and I don’t need 24 hour care she begs to differ. What is it treatment like? Could I hide that i’m disordered around food and just deal with the drugs and possible PTSD? 

I can’t lose the control rn everything is just a lot and I don’t want to keep bothering my therapist about everything.

1mmmsa9,Pure 7 OH is basically gas station morphine with no warnings,"Just a heads up for anyone who’s thinking about trying Pure7 — that little strawberry-flavored tablet they sell at smoke shops and gas stations? It’s not just “strong kratom.” It’s pure 7-hydroxymitragynine, which is the most powerful opioid compound in kratom.

Here’s the messed up part:
	•	It’s up to 13× stronger than morphine by weight. One 30 mg tablet = hundreds of mg of morphine.
	•	Sold right over the counter, no prescription, no warnings, no age check.
	•	Flavored like candy and marketed like an energy supplement.
	•	Way more addictive than regular kratom leaf — withdrawal is nasty.
	•	Combine it with alcohol, benzos, or anything else that slows breathing and you’re playing with fire.

sobriety just feels so…boring? i dont wanna stop doing drugs, i just wanna be able to be sober for a few days without it being hell. i wanna start small, just like one day a week of just coffee and cigs. then maybe two days. i wanna build some level of self control and discipline with this shit.

1mn8s56,My (true) story,"The Mind of an Addict: Chasing Ghosts and Facing Death

Addiction isn’t just about the high. It’s about escape. It’s about silencing the noise in your head, numbing the pain, filling a void that nothing else seems to touch. And for an addict, the scariest part of getting clean isn’t the withdrawals or the cravings—it’s facing the life they’ve been running from.

Drugs don’t just hijack your body; they rewire your brain. They become the answer to every problem, the solution to every bad day. When you’re in it, you can’t imagine life without them. When you’re out, you can’t believe you ever lived like that.

I spent nearly 20 years inside that cycle. What started as a bad habit turned into something darker—something that nearly killed me more times than I can count.

One of those times, I did die.

And that’s where my story really begins.

The Descent Into Addiction

My story starts like so many others. I had my first cigarette at 12. That led to weed. But By high school, it was far from the norm. I was snorting ten Lortabs or five Percocets a day. I dropped out in the 11th grade, but by that point, I was already an addict, locked into a cycle of dependency.

By 20, I had been using drugs daily for eight years. And yet, that was just the tip of an enormous, ugly iceberg.

From 20 to 23, Roxicodone (Roxy 30mg) became my new normal—at least two a day. From 23 to 25, it escalated to OxyContin. Then, at 26, I crossed the line I never thought I would: I started shooting up heroin and meth while popping Xanax on top of it.

I was a walking coma, drifting through life with a barely-there existence. Even on the days when I didn’t have drugs and was forced into withdrawal, my mind was fogged, my body barely functioning. This continued until I was 34. Each year, the addiction tightened its grip. My health deteriorated. My overdoses became more frequent. The last two or three years were the darkest—one year, I overdosed 10 or 12 times.

And in those final days of my addiction, I reached a point where I just couldn’t do it anymore. The pain, the suffering, the damage I had done to myself—it felt irreversible. I didn’t want to wake up. Twice, and so I overdosed intentionally.

But something happened during the last one. Something I still struggle to put into words.

The Overdose That Changed Everything

I was in a friend’s bathroom  with a couple of others, getting high like we had so many times before. But unknown to them I had took 2 Xanax bars directly before I met up with them and for those that aren't familiar. That combination is a death sentence every time and so as I stood at the sink, trying to soak up as much of the present moment as I could knowing it was going to be my last my mind raced along as if I had the pedal to the floor looking at a dead end road ahead so when I looked in the mirror an unprecedented introspective 1000 yard stare was all that was there and so once i pulled the needle from my arm, and rinsed it off. My world started to blur. I leaned back against the wall, trying to steady myself, but the darkness was closing in fast. One last glance at myself in the mirror before it melted revealed the 7 year old version of myself looking back with pure disappointment and as I started to smile and reach out to him to comfort him everything started to fade ..

I knew I was about to slip away.

Then, I did.
My breathing slowed until it simply ceased. Then my heart stopped beating 

And yet, I was still there—just not in my body.

I felt an overwhelming calmness, a peace unlike anything I had ever known. I watched as my lifeless body crumpled to the floor. A woman screamed into the phone between frantic attempts at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Her panic didn’t affect me. I wasn’t afraid. I wasn’t sad. I wasn’t anything.

I heard sirens in the distance. As they grew louder, I found myself floating up, above the house, watching the ambulance pull onto the street. Paramedics jumped out, accompanied by a deputy, and rushed inside. They administered Narcan and started working on me.

I observed all of this as if I were a detached spectator, no longer bound to the life I had once clung to so desperately.

Then, I heard her. The woman who had been trying to revive me sobbed, her voice breaking:

“He’s dead… Oh my God, please, no!”

At that exact moment, something shook me violently.

I shot upward—faster than I can describe. It felt like I was holding my breath as I rocketed through the cosmos, faster than the speed of light. I passed planets—Mars,  Saturn, Jupiter—and sailed beyond the stars, which, unlike the Sun, appeared more majestic, more… alive.

It felt like I had been traveling for minutes, yet time had no meaning.

Then, suddenly, I turned around.

I didn’t decide to—I just did.

I was yanked back toward Earth at the same impossible speed. And as I hurtled home, something struck me like a tidal wave:

My daughter.

She would grow up without her father. I could hear her precious but devastated voíce..
I want my daddy...

That thought hit me harder than any withdrawal, any overdose, any moment of suffering I had ever endured. I could feel tears forming.

And then—BOOM.

A sonic explosion of sensation crashed into me as I slammed back into my body.

I gasped, eyes snapping open, light flooding my vision. A paramedic stumbled backward, startled by the suddenness of my return.

Tears were already in my eyes. Without thinking, I reached for her, overwhelmed by gratitude, by the sheer, unexplainable fact that I was alive.

That was the moment everything changed.

Life After Death

There’s no easy way to explain what happened that day. Was it a hallucination? A near-death experience? A glimpse into something beyond this world? I don’t know.

But what I do know is this: I found out what's really important in my life, I was given a second chance. And I get to hug my daughter everyday.

I won’t say the road to recovery was easy. I won’t pretend I woke up that day and all my struggles were gone. But I woke up different. I knew I couldn’t go back. I wouldn’t go back.

And I haven’t.

If you’re struggling—if you think there’s no way out—I promise you, there is.

I should be dead.

But I’m not.

And neither are you.

My bf and I are both 30 and have been together for just over a year. He told me he had a coke addiction early on but promised to stop. Of course I believed him and of course he didn’t stop, but I only know because I keep catching him in lies. He promises to stop every single time. If I catch him somehow he says it was just a tiny bump. This time he supposedly hasn’t done it since 4th of July when I last caught him. I have however found deleted messages between him and a drug dealer. His phone won’t show me the messages, only a time stamp from when they last texted. 

This means I don’t have proof of drug use, only suspicion.

I confronted him about the time stamp from July 29th which caused a huge fight. The stress from this caused me to miscarry 2 days later.
Last night I saw a new time stamp from August 1st.

I have not confronted him about what I just saw yet. I want advice on how to handle this.

Should I wait for the next time stamp and ask if he will agree to a drug test?

Please let me in on what he is thinking and why he has to keep lying to me? I have come to him from a place of compassion and support but he still hides it and lies.

Should I just cut my losses or keep giving him a chance? I know this is complex but I  hate being lied to and I’m afraid for our future.

1mnf92s,Desperately need help with the constant cravings that never leave even after years…,"Before I get into it, my goal of this rant is to find help being able to stay completely sober without getting depressed or constantly itching for relief. I’ve not been able to do it with the regular recommendations. I tried talking to psychiatrists about getting on medication but because of my history they just suggest going to groups. I don’t think they understand how severe the dark feelings and on edge feeling actually goes. It interferes with my daily life more than smoking does if that makes sense, so I need genuine ways to get someone who’s constantly anxious and on edge to feel the same relief as smoking but without smoking? I know it’s not possible, but there has to be ways to make it easier.  

For reference I have 4 years clean from my actual DOC and during the first 2 years I didn’t smoke weed. I was absolutely miserable, I tried everything to get myself in a happy place. I went to the gym everyday, meetings, go to school full time for a subject I enjoy, have a good relationship and moving up in life. But for some reason even with those 2 years I didn’t smoke and all the good things that come with soberity I just wanted to be able to unwind. I can’t relax naturally, not like that. I can never fully get to a place where I’m not on edge and completely let go if that makes sense. I’ve been smoking for the past year and my life came together, I was able to start doing more things for myself, starting cooking fancy meals I enjoyed, able to watch tv, able to not be a bitch lol, and honestly my dark/passive life ending thoughts stopped. I also say “smoking” but realistically I mostly just eat an edible after work so I can unwind for the night. And on the weekends I have a pen which doesn’t get used as much. Nothing bad has come from it, but my family found out and are now blackmailing me into doing weekly drug tests (I’m in my mid 20s) or I’m on the street. It’s nice to know I have something to unwind, at the end of the week or the end of the day. I’ve tried all the herbs and teas, exercise, hobbies, groups, jobs, meetings, nature, moving away, meditating, cbd, etc. 
Anyway, I have to quit again. I’m actually terrified for how my mental health will deplete. I’m already looking at anything else I can do to help me feel normal without getting caught and it makes me feel like an addict again and I hate it. I wish my parents didn’t think thc was the same as opiates but that’s out of my hands. I’ve been self medicating my entire life, because through multiple trials with doctors I’ve never found a medication that works. I just know for a fact that even when I stop smoking I’m miserable from experience. ",1754924251.0,1,1,addiction,addiction

Me and my husband(of 18 yrs)had 2 children at the time and were trying for a 3rd. I had gotten pregnant and lost a baby and my next cycle after that we tried again with fertility medicine. Right after I took the medication and ovulated with my 4th pregnancy, I found out that he had paid over $6,000 in the course of over a year on a cocaine addiction. This was found out completely by accident which led to the knowledge that he had a separate account (a chime card) that he was funneling money into before it even hit his main bank account. He admitted to the addiction only for me to find out that he had dabbled with crystal meth before the cocaine. I knew that he had tried cocaine once as a teenager but he never touched it again. He had not used elicit drugs while we were together whatsoever. Flash Forward during my pregnancy he was trying to get clean and had at least four or five relapses. At one point I did make him leave to get clean. His last relapse was the beginning of November of last year and then I had our last child at the end of the year. He has been clean ever since, I basically told him I could not have him in my life nor our children's lives with his addiction as deep as it was. He straight up quit cold turkey. And has not used since. Someone tell me that this is possible and this is something I'm not gonna have to worry about the rest of our lives, him relapsing. He was using cocaine at least a couple times a week. I know it is a hard drug to come off of but he made it look so easy. I guess I need a little bit of reassurance, I don't know. I'm thankful he is clean, but he gaslit the shit out of me when he was using. Telling me that I was the reason because we would argue. And I guess in the back of my head I'm worried if I take an argument too far he will relapse.  I don't know if he's clean because he chose our family and children over his addiction. Or because I'm monitor this shit out of any income coming into our home, made him cut ties completely with his dealer, and shut down that extra account. So I don't know if the only reason he isn't using is because he doesn't have a way to pay for it. Before anybody asks his drug use was seriously a surprise to me. The only thing that was different was he would have anger outbursts with me but I honestly contributed that to the fact that he was on bipolar medication and sometimes he was not able to get it from the doctor due to insurance. If you would have asked me a year prior to this if I would be worried about him doing drugs, I would tell you that you were crazy and that would be the last thing he would do.. boy was I wrong.  :(",1754905230.0,2,2,addiction,addiction

He went back to a former small employer with a cokehead coworker. Fast forward 2 weeks and he was awake for 41 hours straight working. (He can work any hours he wants.) I asked how and he said he needs to make money and impress the employer. He said he drank some beers to stay awake. (He falls asleep when he drinks beer.) One night he went to the co-workers.

He also didnt really smell like beer. As soon as he feel asleep the jumping started! Imagine that! I woke him up and said he'd have to go sleep in the guest room because he was jumping again and he said no and told me I was making it up.

Just one more high to silence the shame,

1mmupko,Numb lips after kissing husband,"Hello. My husband hasn't done any cocaine in a couple of years ( yes I can tell.) He's went back to a former small employer with a cokehead coworker. Fast forward 2 weeks and he was awake for 41 hours straight working one time. (He can work any hours he wants.) I asked how and he said he needs to make money and impress the employer. He said he drank some beers to stay awake. (He falls asleep when he drinks beer.) One night he went to the co-workers. Didn't tell me he was going because he knows I don't like it. Just calls after he's there. Says he has no idea when he'll get home. I predicted that he'll make an excuse like he doesn't want to drive after drinking, even though he does all the time. At midnight he calls and says just don't worry about him, just drinking beer by the campfire. Said he doesn't feel like driving! Surpirse! Said he'll probably just sleep in the car. Anyway later he came home and 2:30 anyway. I can't sleep when he isn't there so I was tossing and turning. I didn't want to stir up a fight so I just kissed him and said goodnight. Immediately after kissing him I got the strangest sensation on my lips like they were burning and tingling. Went on for half an hour. I googled it in the morning and apparently it's pretty common if someone used coke that happens. He gets this weird thing where he jumps and kicks about every 30 seconds when he gets to sleep. I predicted that would happen too and waited til he fell asleep.Guess what started happening?!! He did jump. I woke him and said ok, you're keeping me awake and you'll have to sleep in the guest room. He said no, that I was making it up. He swears he didn't do anything on his kids' lives but all the signs point to it. He pointed out all my mistakes and said I'm a bad wife and he's going to leave me and said I'm imagining things. Do you think I'm just imagining things and looking for that because of my past trauma when he was using bad? It was very bad so maybe I'm just looking for it? ",1754861355.0,1,11,addiction,addiction

1mma7ij,"I will never have as much fun as I did on drugs, how do I cope?","This one might be long, sorry. I used to do a lot of substances, first I drank, then smoked weed, then did ketamine, then Molly, then opioids, amphetamines, xans, Valium, and more.

 I didn’t have one of the really bad benzo or opioid addictions, mainly I was addicted to ketamine and amphetamines. I liked my life so much more back then. I have so many good memories. 

I always liked being the one to be able to go the hardest, and do the most. And I always was the one who did the most, and people liked me for it. I liked being reckless and I liked going farther than other people.

I started by doing substances while I went out with my friends, then I started finishing what I had left when I got home, then I started to prefer doing substances (specifically ketamine) at home because I could do more without people saying I was too intoxicated (because at the amounts I’d be doing I’d be unable to move or speak) I’d make it a competition with myself to do as much as possible.

Then I started needing ketamine to function. I would only go to school if I had ketamine, I’d get money any way I could. My routine was wake up, do a line, go to school and keep doing lines and bumps all day, then after school go to pick up, do half of more of what I bought that night, then do the rest at school the next day, and repeat. 

I loved having friends to do drugs with and friends that would tweak with me. I loved the first time I did crystal molly with my friends when I was completely out of control with bliss, I was shivering and sweating and I was grinding my teeth, but it didn’t matter because of how absolutely amazing I felt. I miss seeing my friends in the hallways in school and asking if they had anything, ket, coke, a cart, their prescription, whatever. I miss all of it. 

After I got caught everything changed. 

I have a loving girlfriend, I’m more engaged with my family, I’m going to college, but it feels like a giant hole was ripped out of me. I miss my past life. I miss it so bad. I know I’m definitely feeling like this because of all of the drugs I did. But I just can’t escape this feeling. Every day I’m completely numb. Bad days, good days, they’re genuinely all the same to me, because nothing compares to the highs and lows of what the substances gave me. Nothing has ever compared to the feelings I felt then. I feel like a suit of skin just pushing on and on, and on and on. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to cope, it’s been almost a year. I’ve tried to cope but this feeling always comes back, I’ve tried counseling, therapy, anything. Nothing will ever compare. I could win the lottery but I don’t think I would be as happy as I was. I don’t see this ending well for me. 

Does anybody have any advice, has anybody been able to get past this feeling? Thank you",1754803021.0,17,33,addiction,addiction

What matters is that you keep getting back up. Every time you choose to try again, you’re building strength, even if it doesn’t feel like it in the moment.

Cut off the people and places that keep pulling you back in, even if it hurts. Find people who actually want to see you get better, and hold onto them. And don’t be ashamed to ask for help, there’s no weakness in wanting a better life.

My parents and my wife have always known about my past struggles with alcohol, marijuana, and pornography (parents don’t know about porn but know about alcoh and weed). But what they didn’t know was that I’ve been, even to this day, fighting the same demons. When I opened up to her and my parents, I did so knowing that I had to stop fighting alone and needed the support of the people who love me most. I am extremely grateful that my parents and wife were nonjudgmental and only want to see me better myself. It’s still very early on in the pregnancy (6 weeks) but just the simple fact that my wife is pregnant gives me an unexplainable amount of grit and motivation to better myself. The issue now is that I’ve seen myself fall in cycles where I do amazing for weeks-months but then fall and repeat the addictions (alcohol, weed, porn) for weeks-months after. And thats affecting my mental schema in ways that shakes my confidence in being able to overcome this.

1mmpvxe,I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO FEELING LIKE LIFE IS OVER,"Im 16 and have no idea about what the fuck i am supposed to

I dont really know if this post will reach to a lot of people but i really need to share how i feel.I was emotionally numb since i have known myself and only way i felt things was thru adrenaline, stupid and risky things made me feel alive and it just made me feel things because then again i couldnt feel emotions that much. Fighting, wrestling until i got kicked out my group because i was obsessive about asking them to do more all the time, then i started hangin out with my neighborhood friends and we did a lot of stupid embarassing shit, we spied on heroin users shooting up scared of getting caught, we yelled as loud as we can inside apartments and running away, throwing fruits or any objects we could find, it was such a rush and i dont remember any moment i felt “that” alive and fullfilled. So you know i got labeled as the bad friend by my friends’ families and they were right so they cut contacts with me. I was alone I was empty i wanted to die because there was no purpose no rush no thrill and i was a dropout at the time. So i met with alcohol it just calmed me down i didnt feel the urge to do anything stupid i didnt care about chasing the thrill or anything. Alcohol was fun at first i was 15 me and my friend would drink and it would feel like a dream state we would laugh our ass off just looking at each other and i liked it. Then a few months later i tried to get back to wrestling and failed, didnt have the motivation the desire to do the thing that mattered the most to me. And i felt like a bitch i mean it. I felt like i lost something that made me me. After that my friend and i drank together and i said to myself fuck wrestling fuck all those things i dont want to chase anything anymore i just want this steadiness this relaxation alcohol gives me. You know it was just beer then i tried vodka and i only drank vodka afterwards also i had to get a job because drinking everyday was expensive. I would make money somehow and just keep drinking just keep drinking i was like i never sobered up and just kept drinking. This drinking period went on for like 30-40 days then when i was drunk someone gave me a pill called lyrica it was the real one from the pharmacy and i liked it it was cheaper longer lasting just better than alcohol right, the next day i bought more, then in the nigh time some more and that night was the shit that was the beginning of my current situation. I knew the ones i bought later on was laced up i was expecting a relaxation but hell no it gave me this rush, felt like wrestling, fighting, stealing eyes wide open jaw clenching and i was in love because it was such a familiar feeling. I kept on takin for some more days and i ran out of money so they didnt give me that pill no more and they gave me something cheaper instead it was an antiseizure med and i treated that pill like alcohol, one felt nice lets take the second, the second felt better fuck im afraid to take more but lets take one half. I did this for 3 days or so then overdosed i think? My head never stopped spinning for the last 3 days i was hallucinating i felt like collapsing on the floor couldnt walk straight or speak normally heart beating real fast, then i told my mother what was going on because i was high, and felt like dying so we went to the hospital i dont remember those times much i thought i was really dying i felt like my body functions were shutting up and she learned everything i have been doing at the time. was i a coward? I have no idea about that i just knew something was off and i had to go to the hospital. Later on i found out, those pills were effective for 36 hours and taking more and more stacked the shit up causing this. Anyways they sent me to a psychiatrist he gave me ritalin. Ritalin felt like a rush just like those laced up pills so i liked it. And i wasnt comfortable going out like used to because mother knew what i was up to so i stayed home. Because i got all i wanted, drugs. Even 10 mg would do wonders for me and it kept me inside home. Dose got up the meds changed to medikinet 30 mg 40 mg and i took it as prescribed but i was just a fuckin nobody i stayed home all the time. Fast forward 8 months later i decided to go out, see my old friends i got drunk and high with, they were all distant because i just dissappeared for 8 months. Now they were smoking opioids and i was scared of going back, you know i was just taking laced up pills and getting drunk, no opioids. So i started to take more of my pills 60 mg medikinet or 90 mg sleep deprived just taking more sleeping for 3 5 hours and taking more eventually i ran out of pills and by a miracle i was able to get ritalin now im taking around 50 mg daily not as bad as it used to be like medikinet but im running out of this pill too around 7 pills left. And my friends they are smoking meth rn and i dont want to get involved in that scene. The streets they feel like the only life i have but i now i cant go back because its not softcore shit like drinking anymore they are smoking METH. So yeah im sorry this was a long read, i just want to know what the fuck am i supposed to do at this point, i dont go out much and i hate it because i dont feel like going out i just stay home and take ritalin if i go out there is meth. And im bored of this cycle i really hate this cycle i want out i wanna rebuild a life that doesnt involve being a junkie from the streets and also not a junkie who stays home and “tries” to get high off ritalin. Idk man sorry once again this was really long i just need some advice or anything.",1754850057.0,1,8,addiction,addiction
1mmk1wc,7 years sober from drugs and alcohol recently quit anabolic steroids and I’m struggling,"So 7 years ago I quit drugs and alcohol haven’t looked back once in those 7 years unfortunately I was naive in thinking you couldn’t become addicted to anabolic steroids so I find myself starting a whole new sobriety journey only this time I’m really struggling.

I’m female, 33 and had been taking a multitude of anabolics but I consistently remained on testosterone- I just loved how I felt. I felt strong I looked strong , I had a spark and a purpose I had motivation and drive.
I was a somebody who people admired.

I had started having issues with my blood sugars (I’m a bit of a hypochondriac both on paper and in real life) however the issues were real. I kept feeling like my sugars were dropping but at the time I’d just treat it there and then and carry on like the badass I was no sweat.

I came off for that reason along with being diagnosed with haemochromatosis and having consistently elevated Haemocrit, haemoglobin and RBC both of which are consistent with my condition and ped use.

I’ve really not noticed ANY positives coming off testosterone I’m 35 off, my hormones as per my last panel were actually coming into balance surprisingly well as were all my other blood results.

However since I’ve quit for the first time in 7 years I’m tempted to drink, or score some opiates.

Since quitting anabolic steroids I feel like I’m not me , I’ve lost my muscle quite fast because I have zero desire to train or do anything , I feel flat I have no drive, no motivation, I don’t enjoy anything I think I’m depressed honestly.

Anxiety has always been a HUGE issue for me now it’s even worse because I have nothing to channel it into, I’m pricking my finger so often my fingers are sore and bruised,
I’m obsessing over every increase in heart rate,
Every bodily sensation is terrifying and signal that there’s something massive wrong.

I try training and just have nothing to give, nearly everyone in all my local gyms are using gear so it’s hugely triggering.

I’m at a point where I need to feel something I’ve always replaced one addiction with another and I’m in very dangerous territory right now because for the first time in 7 years I have nothing to replace it with.

I’ve been prescribed citalopram and I’m considering taking it but then I’ll just be numb and they themselves come with a whole multitude of side effects that for someone with anxiety especially health focused anxiety are terrifying.

Both times I quite something I did it to give my kids longer with their mum but now even off they’ve lost their mum because without some kind of substance to rely on I don’t know who I am.


I’m not sure the point of this post, maybe seeking some moral support, maybe hopefully to interact with someone who has also quit peds and experienced this and can tell me it won’t last forever?

1mmi20w,Thank you,"I just wanted to say thank you to and for this sub. I stopped drinking a few years ago, no small thanks to being able to vent, ask questions, etc. on r/stopdrinking. Although I stopped drinking, I have still been dabbling in other things. My rationale has been somewhere along the lines that my drinking was the worst problem and had to go, which is somewhat true. Until I stopped drinking, nothing else was going to be possible, and in fact, at the tail end of my drinking I had a short run with with some of the really hard stuff (and that seems to have been one of the many drivers for me to finally stop drinking).

I've been in the ""contemplative state/phase"" regarding continued usage of some other things. I know my usage in these other things pales in to comparison to what others are and have gone through, but has still been a thing and clearly has kept cravings and mental obsessions active. And I know one habit at how I have partaken is not good for me regarding potential neurotoxicity.

I've been doing a lot of reading on this sub lately and have even posted some. Something has flipped/switched for me in the past few weeks. I'm sensing that same motivation and drive for change that occurred when I stopped drinking. I am ""watching my thoughts"", observing that part of my mind that wants me to cave ""kick and scream"" (cravings I guess) and just letting it do its thing without giving in. I'm now very much wanting this change and ready to do what I need to do.

1mlthq5,"If you think you might have an addiction, read this","Addiction doesn’t always look like the movies. You don’t have to lose everything before it’s “real.” If something is slowly taking over your thoughts, your time, and your priorities, it’s worth paying attention to now, before it gets worse.

Be honest with yourself, even if it’s uncomfortable. Ask: If I removed this from my life, would I feel anxious, restless, or lost? If the answer is yes, that’s a sign to take action.

You don’t have to do it alone. Reach out to a friend, family member, or support group. Even talking to a stranger online can help break that feeling of isolation.

Small steps matter, cutting back a little, setting limits, finding healthier distractions. Don’t wait until you “hit bottom” to care about yourself. Start now, while you still have more control than you think.

1mlt31c,A small piece of advice if you’re struggling with addiction,"If you’re dealing with addiction, whether it’s substances, gambling, gaming, or anything else, don’t wait for a “perfect moment” to quit or cut back. That moment rarely comes. The best time to start is now, even if it’s a small step.

You don’t have to go all-in right away. Try replacing it with something healthier for even part of the day. Tell someone you trust, even if it feels uncomfortable. Keep track of the progress, no matter how small, it matters.

Most importantly, don’t beat yourself up for slipping. Recovery isn’t a straight line. What matters is that you keep trying, even if you’ve tried before and “failed.” Every attempt teaches you something you’ll need for the next one.

You’re not weak for struggling, you’re human. And humans can change.

And in the end I did meth. another day after night when I actually slept i did meth again, and again another day. I missed 3 days at work.

And in the end of the third dose of meth I started believeing that some kind of far right elite put a chip into my brain with AI that manipulates with my memories and read my mind. I hallucinated wierd digital distortions as a proof I have chip in my head. Also for example I saw a list of some intimate facts about me in front of me as a message from them that they know everything about me. After getting some sleep I got bit better, after another sleep I realized it was all delusions and hallucintions.

I totally scared myself, my girlfriend and I am glad It ended. Now I am on day 7 clean and all week I am trying to get to dual diagnosis rehab again. I will get there next week. They called me that they will accept me on friday or sooner.

With addiction i will loose relationships, job, sanity, money... And in the end i would have to stop anyway

I'm worried about my friend who uses pens somewhat often and she has a long family history of addiction.

Her mother overdosed and her father did too but didn't die from it.

Most of her family members started with weed and slowly got addicted to cocaine, crack, etc.

I'm worried because she's doing it more and more often, and has a high tolerance so she hits them around 20 times every time. (Usually in only an hour or two.) 

(Which seems scarily high to me)

She doesn't use sativa, just indica.

She is also a teenager so I know it's ""normal"" so I'm worried about her.

What methods helped you to get clean of severe 7OH addictions?  Will I need to go to an inpatient treatment facility, or is it viable to get clean other ways?

I have now been a daily user of 7OH for nearly a year.  It has nearly destroyed my life and confidence that I once had in myself.  I use around 200mg of 7OH per day and have to dose every 90-120 minutes (usually 5-15mg doses depending on how much anxiety I have). My entire life revolves around these little 7OH tablets.   I can’t go two hours without them unless I want to spiral out of control and experience ungodly withdrawals that are horribly painful.  I feel horribly lost and I feel so much despair - I dare say hopeless.

I want to change and I want to be the father my children deserve, and the husband my wife deserves - but I am broken.  I need help.  I want to change so badly, but when I go through the severe anxiety attacks I always find myself taking high doses and failing at my goals.  I’ve wanted to get away from 7OH for 9 months now, but I feel hopeless and unable to.

1ml22ij,Anybody feel like there are people in your life who consistently want to see you relapse?,"I was in a relationship with a narcissist for 5 years. She not only introduced me to drugs, but actively pressured me into using with her when I got sober.

I’d refuse, saying I wanted to stay clean, just to be met with stuff like 

“What’s wrong with you? A real man would just do a little with me. A normal person can control themself. You have no self control, you’re pathetic. If you had any, you’d do this with me”

She shamed me for using without her, but I’d told her what makes me self destructive early on and I noticed she’d act to make me feel that way before I’d relapse, only to know I did without me telling her.

And when I explicitly asked for help recovering? She told me she “didn’t have time.” That I was pathetic. That I was weak, etc.

She knows what shame does to most people in that situation. Shaming it gives it power. Shame makes a lot of us relapse. It becomes something a lot of us fear, and fear keeps the thought of the drug in our heads and makes us feel unable to resist. 

Luckily I’ve overcome that, and I’ve realized I have the power to say no just a week after I blocked her entirely.

I used to think that only I was to blame for my behavior, that I was weak and pathetic like she said, and I guess I let that be true. But I didn’t feel that way before she told me I was. And looking back, she didn’t want me clean and actively sabotaged me. She wanted me addicted and ashamed, so that I’d be easier to control. ",1754675485.0,7,5,addiction,addiction

i know i need to stop as it has created problems for me and my partner in the past... however i just can't seem to WANT to quit. i hate myself that i still dont want to quit, even though i need to..

i know it's bad for me and i know i am making it more difficult by pushing it further but i simply cannot do life sober...

the one thing that helps me be there and perform well at work, be a good partner and generally just live is what i need to cut out because it's not good for me long term... quite sad and ironic...

1ml8kq6,A Porn Addiction destroyed my savings and ruined my future,"I'm aware that people, guys especially, watch porn a lot. I'm aware that it's normal and reasonable, especially for someone who's a teenager. I say this because I need to explain why what i had was not at all within the bounds of normal. 

I've been watching porn since i was 13. Definitely more often than what i would think the average is: daily if not twice a day. It was a really persistent habit throughout my teenage years that i could not break. I also kept the extent of it secret out of shame and fear, given i grew up religious.

I was lucky enough to grow up comfortably, with a lot of people invested in my future. Going into my first semester of college, I had around 10,000 in savings and a bright outlook being a good student. But then I had an Anxiety-fueled mental breakdown during my orientation week and ended up taking a semester off. During that time i started sinking hundreds, thousands of dollars into porn online. This continued when i went back to college. 

It got to the point where my parents noticed the money drain and confronted me, and I told them about it. I gave them my debit card to keep away from me as i tried to get away from the addiction. I decided to finally talk to my therapist about it, too. But that went significantly worse. She was visibly grossed out and uncomfortable, which i definitely do not blame her for. But we couldn't talk the same after that. I ended up just stopping therapy altogether because no progress was being made. 

And then I relapsed. Hard.

I'm now sitting here, close to my 21st birthday, with less than 500 dollars in savings, having spent it all on fucking porn. I'm overcoming the addiction out of necessity, but it's been awful. I've lost all motivation to do anything outside of barely skid by in college. My main creative pursuit, writing, is completely fucking dead right now. I got a new therapist but i am so deathly afraid of weirding her out like i did the last one that I still haven't brought it up. I know processing the whole thing could help but i don't know who i can talk to about it without making them uncomfortable enough to never want to talk to my again. I'm an empty shell of who i was, and it's my fault.

I'm sorry to my parents and family, who invested so much in my future only for me to squander it completely. 

I'm sorry to my last therapist, who would've been better off if i hadn't said anything. She in no way had to deserve hearing what I've done. 

I'm sorry to my friends who I've grown strained with as the depression from withdrawal had made me more and more antisocial. 

I'm sorry to my past self for completely fucking up my future. 

I don't know what else to say, really. Thanks for reading through this nightmare.",1754690892.0,2,6,addiction,addiction
1ml2oyn,2 years now for the first time,"Hey all,

Wanted to come here to help mark an important milestone in my sobriety. Two days ago I achieved 2 continuous years of sobriety from alcohol and other drugs. I wanted to come celebrate with this sub, which has been nearly an everyday support for me.

This milestone is important because it's the first time I've achieved 2 years since I began my addiction journey at the age of 13 (I'm 36M, living in Vancouver). I had achieved 1 year sober a number of times, but I always made an excuse that I was cured, very typical stuff, or let a very negative life event sway me back into old habits. I have been attempting sobriety since I was 13 and seriously since I was 24.

Initially I went to treatment as a young adult, and from there was introduced to meetings, which helped a lot in the beginning, but as I've gotten deeper into finding out who I am in sobriety, I've had to forge my own path. I am very irreligious, and plainly non-spiritual. But I still have learned many principles for living a better life through these programs, like honestly, living your life supporting others and speaking positively on the benefits of sobriety. The main ways I engage with the philosophy of sobriety is through literature (currently reading 'never enough' by Judith Grisel), through individual counseling and through maintaining sober friendships. My girlfriend is also sober, which helps a lot I think.

Anyways, I just wanted to share a little bit of my life, how my recent sobriety has worked for me, and to reach out and say thanks to a Subreddit which has been a great resource and support for me, thank you all, good luck and IWNDWYT!!!",1754676898.0,4,1,addiction,addiction

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 1 year and 5 months. Yes, we’ve had sex a couple of times, and she has also performed oral on me. It felt good, and I can get hard for about 15 minutes, but then I lose my erection and my mood. After that, I have trouble getting hard again. She’s my first girlfriend, and sometimes I overthink during our intimate moments.

I think the problem might be that I masturbate a lot—about 2–3 times a day—and I watch porn when I do. I orgasm, but I often feel dissatisfied, and sometimes I get bored. It’s gotten to the point where masturbating feels like a requirement.

Is this an early stage of ED? Do I have ED? Could this be caused by my masturbation habits?

I travel across the world for sex and I don’t know if it’s really a problem

I’m a 20 year old female from the western United States. I lost my virginity when I was 14 and ever since that experience, I deeply desired sex. In high school, I’d give almost anyone a chance at sex with me because I didn’t really care- I just wanted sex. After high school, I decided to take a year off. I traveled to Europe with a girlfriend of mine and we stayed for about two months. I accumulated a fair amount of bodies there. I was reasonably safe when I did it. After I got back from Europe, a few of the guys that I hooked up with followed me on one of my social medias asked if I could see them again. I told them I couldn’t afford to go back, but they offered to pay for my ticket and any other accommodation while I was there. I accepted for a few men and I’ve had fun every time I went. Ever since then, I will travel anywhere from Europe to Asia to anywhere in the United States as long as the person I’m coming to pays for the ticket or anything else I’ll need while I’m there. My parents and some of my friends disagree with my decisions and say what I do is dangerous and irresponsible. I personally didn’t think this was a problem, but now I am unsure. As long as I like the men I’m taking to and I trust them, I’ll come to them and we always use protection. I don’t know though, do I have a problem?",1754695908.0,0,15,addiction,addiction

It felt like it made me incredibly smart, and even was the catalyst into me finding Christ.. I pursued Him way harder when I was on it, than I do now. I tried harder, i felt more convicted about average things in my life.. things that I dont even notice anymore. I wish I could have that state of being all the time, without the drug.

**Characters:**
•	km – The Knowhere Man 
•	WBRC – Wifey / Big Red Cunt (depending on her mood that day) 
•	fd – fentanyl demon 

**Casa de la Big Red Cunt**
*04/28/24*
*13:56 Ray Ban Meta View*
 
  *Today’s the day I decide to kick fentanyl, and I’m going to do it as painfully and miserably as possible: NARCAN myself to go into precipitated withdrawal and live in the care under a psychotic red head who I would come to find out is going to treat my two month detox process with the tenderness of a fucking Navy SEAL instructor during Hell Week. Why? Because if I can do it, then YOU can do it. No fucking excuses. I start my kick on the back porch as I record myself taking the NARCAN.*

-km: Step one to getting off of fentanyl. Take your fentanyl, stomp in the fuckin ground, BURN it. Take this, NARCAN, put it in your fuckin nostril, take two if you're big.. -*clears nostril, then sprays the container into my nostril*-..and allow the NARCAN to rip the fentanyl out of your fuckin body.. and send yourself into precipitated withdrawal.. and start the fuckin process of getting It THE FUCK OUT! Step Fucking One, GET IT OUT OF YOUR FUCKING BODY! STEP. FUCKing. Two... 
 
  *Camera feed from the Ray Ban Metas cut off, and I go back inside the house. FEAR-Kendrick is playing on the loud speaker downstairs, the sun is coming in through the skylights in the upstairs bedroom, and I sit down on the bed in anticipation. A couple of minutes go by, and I still feel normal.*
 
-km:-*sighhh*- fuck.. This stuff gonna kick in or what? 

  *Tapping my foot anxiously, I check the time impatiently and I wonder if I took enough.*

-km: - Ughhh alright.. fuck it. Where's that shot at?.. BAAAABE!! You Got That Shot?? BABE? -*sighhh*- fuck me.. 
 *I get off of the bed to go downstairs and ask Big Red where the syringe of NARCAN is. She's in the bathroom fresh out of the shower doing her hair & make-up and I take a seat on the edge of the tub behind her.*
 
-WBRC: What's up? 
 
-km: I did it. 
 
-WBRC: Did what?.. The NARCAN?? -*Looks me over in the mirror*- You seem like you're handling it okay.. I thought you'd be on the floor shitting yourself? 
 
-km: Shittt, fentanyl ain't big enough to put ME on the fuckin ground. 

-*Yes, I really said that out loud.*-
 
-WBRC: How long has it been since you took it? 
 
-km: Idk, couple minutes. I don't know if one was enough though. You said you had some in a shot, you tryna hit me with that? 
 
-WBRC: Yeah, gimme like 5 minutes. I'm almost done in here. 
 
-km: Bet, thanks babe. 
 
  *I give her a kiss on the cheek before I head back upstairs and have a seat on the bed while I wait. The music is still playing loudly, FEAR-Kendrick is wrapping up, and Big Facts-Meso is the next song in order on my playlist. I sit on the bed and smile as I sing along.*
 
-km: Yeah bitch I'll get my shit back, big facts, Big FA..ooofuckk… 
 *My smile quickly fades as I feel a wave of anxiety wash over me, along with a chill deep down in my bones. My skin begins to crawl, my whole body is clammy and I begin to panic as I start to second guess my decision to NARCAN myself. Shit is about to Very real.*
 
-km: Ohh Fuckkblurrpp BLERUGHHHHEerrrp!!! 
 
  *I puke, violently. Before I can even catch my breath, I puke again. And again. And again. And again.. It feels as if someone is rolling my guts up through my throat like I’m a tube of toothpaste. It's fucking miserable. Over and over I wretch into the trash can the blackest, foulest substance I've ever seen.*

  *My concept of time is quickly dissipating and the room begins to spin. The music grows deafeningly loud in my ears, the snare drum rattles faster and faster before the first bass drop, the room spins faster and faster, everything seems to be growing darker, and I think I’m about to blackout. Instead, the beat drops with a dubsteppy WUUUB, and I suddenly feel myself flying through the air straight into some kind of blueish purple wormhole resembling a 3-dimensional mandala. I'm moving through it so fast I can hardly breathe, much less scream. Before I know it, I’m shot out like a cannonball from somewhere high up in the sky and I’m heading straight for the ground. Before I can even brace myself, I slam into the ground with a* **POOF** *of black dust, in a place not of this world…*
 
**Gods Nightmare**
*04/28/24(?)*
*∞:∞(?)*
 
  *I stand up as the dust settles around me and I notice that I'm partially coated in some kind of black ashy film. I brush some of it away as I take in the scene around me. The ground everywhere is black asphalt, cracked and splitting, with a fire burning somewhere deep below leaking out white smoke. There are run down buildings and burning skyscrapers barely standing, seeming as if a large bomb had gone off. It's dark here, but I know it isn't nighttime as I can see rather clearly. The sky is mostly purple with shades of orange and yellow, but there is no sun in the sky.*

   *I Am hyper-aware of everything from the adrenaline dump and I realize that I Am not alone. Out of the corner of my eye I see movement, and I freeze in terror as I see what can only be described as a ghost. A translucent figure, no two of them, only a couple of feet tall, chasing each other before disappearing a few seconds later. Christ, were those.. kids?*

   *I don't have time to process that thought, because a second later I see that there are people here. Real, solid human beings, as far as the eye can see of all ages, status, and race with two very distinct traits in common. First, everyone is the same shade of black. I don't mean like African black, this was uniform and absorbed the light like a black hole. It reminds me of the color the bottom of a piece of aluminum foil turns after smoking a whole gram of fentanyl on it. I look down at the black film partially covering me and I realize it's the same stuff.*

   *Second, they are all on their knees with their faces down and hands laid out in front of them as one would bow to a king or worship a god, not a one moves a muscle nor makes a sound. The only thing that really sets any of them apart are those ghosts hanging around or popping in and out of existence in a 5 foot radius around them. Once again, I find that I don't have time to process what I'm seeing because what I see next becomes the sole focus of my attention.*

  *Standing over the kneeling forms are what can only be described as demons. Thousands of them, all identical to each other aside from their size. Some are no larger than a house cat while others are as tall as two & three story apartment buildings. Their bodies are composed of what seems to be near-solid masses of black smoke and give off a dark purple aura. They have trim but thick bodies with long arms and legs, vaguely human shaped. Their crescent-shaped eyes glow white —piercing and malevolent with black pinned out pupils— and perfect dagger-like teeth gleaming in sadistic, Cheshire Cat grins. The crown of their heads are topped with two short gleaming white horns, forked outwards. They move with terrifying deliberation, some stalking soundlessly across the ground like living shadows while others circle or hover over their worshippers like eager predators.*

  *The ground, the sky, and the air feels saturated with an unrelenting, sinister energy. It reminds me very much of The Upside Down in the Netflix show Stranger Things, devoid of hope or love. My brother once posed this to me: If God is real, does He sleep? If God sleeps, then He must have dreams, and if He dreams.. then THIS.. is His nightmare.*

   *Just when I think it can't get any more terrifying, one of the demons reaches down with its smoky appendage to pluck one of the kneeling figures from the earth with its long, razor sharp claws. With a sickening squelchy crunch of blood, bone, and flesh, they are devoured. Growling demonic chuckles and the sound of bones crunching echo faintly in the suffocating air, and I cannot stop the words from leaving my lips..* 
 
-km: What the fuck..? 
 
   *I don't say it much louder than a whisper, but I know I'm fucked before I even finish the sentence. As soon as the words begin to carry past my lips, every single demon in this entire dystopian wasteland freezes in their tracks and turns in unison to stare directly at me. A wave of panic washes over me as I realize I am now the sole object of their focus.*

  *I feel a rumble beneath my feet and I turn my head to see that the biggest of them is making a beeline straight for me with a billionaire walk so confident it would make Connor McGregor look like Courage the Cowardly Dog. The demon is as large as a T-Rex, but his arms are long and thick, his smoky fingers ending in gleaming white claws that resemble scimitars. His evil piercing eyes, along with all of the other demons, stay hyperfocused on me as he walks in my direction.*

  *As he draws nearer, he appears to grow in size, and every few steps he snatches up handfuls of these worshippers and tosses them into the meat-grinding maw that is his mouth for consumption. I can only assume that I am next..*

  *In between myself and the demon’s current trajectory, I see a few small translucent figures pop into view.. the same children from earlier! They are chasing one another in a ghostly game of tag near the same hunched down figure as before, but just as they are about to reach that invisible line where they would normally vanish, one of the smaller demons darts his leg out to trip them up, his eyes never leaving mine. As they fall to the ground my stomach follows suit, as I see them instantly become opaque and now appear to be just normal children. The look of joy on their faces quickly dissolves into one of terror as they finally appear to be aware of this hellish place they now find themselves in. The giant demon is now upon them, and I open my mouth in horror as they are scooped up and devoured as well. Their screams are not so quickly silenced after a few sickening wet crunches.*

   *My adrenaline surges to a level I’d never experienced before and time seems to slow down as my mind goes into overdrive processing everything. The NARCAN, the dive into precipitated withdrawal a few minutes later, the teleportation to this hell, the worshippers covered in the same shit that’s all over me, the children.. the demons.. the death.. fentanyl.. the number one cause of death in this country for anyone under the age of 50.. every six minutes another Soul is gone forever from an accidental overdose.. no.. No.. NO!!!*
    
  *A nuclear bomb goes off in my mind as I realize with gut-wrenching absolute certainty what is taking place around me. This is NOT happening in my imagination. The events taking place around me, along with the ghosts, worshipping slaves, and even the demons, are all TOO real. The people face down on the ground are fentanyl addicts, slaves under the trance of a powerful demon.. like myself. The translucent ghostly people that have been popping in and out of existence are our loved ones.. the family and friends of these trapped souls, and the only time they become visible is when they’re within the demon's reach. All of the people I’ve just witnessed be devoured by the demon, slaves and innocents alike, are the victims that fentanyl claims EVERY SIX FUCKING MINUTES in the REAL WORLD!..*
  
   *As this horrifying realization washes over me, it takes with it every semblance of FEAR that I will EVER feel again. It is purged from my Soul FOREVER, and replaced with RAGE.. the same kind of righteous, insatiable anger that had Jesus flipping over tables in the temple. The kind that I am going to need to harness if I ever hope to defeat this demon CUNT. My back straightens up and I stand tall, every fiber in my being vibrating, and I feel like a star that's about to go supernova. My hands ball into fists, knees slightly bend, and I move my left foot forward as I square up in preparation to tear the demon apart with my bare hands the second he’s within reach. As he grows closer, he shrinks in size substantially.. or maybe my new found courage has grown me to match his? I don't have time to think about it as he is now directly in front of me, with the widest, most evil, shit-eating grin imaginable all over his face. The words hiss out of his mouth like a snake.*

-fentanyl demon: Well, well, well, look what we have we here.. How may I help you my child? 
 
  *My chest puffs out and I stand as tall as I can, nearly foaming at the mouth as I shout at the demon.*

-km: I Am DONE Worshipping you demon! It's MY Fucking Life, and I WANT IT BACK! NOW!!!
 
  *I've never seen such a smug looking prick in my entire fucking life. From the way he chuckles I can see he very obviously knows something that I do not.* 
 
 
-fd: hmhmhm no need for hossstility, you're free to come and go as you pleassse! Just sign right here and you can be on your way!..        
 
   *he conjures up a scroll and a quill pen out of thin air. On the scroll is a bunch of writing in what appears to be some kind of middle eastern language I couldn’t possibly understand, but it resembles a contract of some sort.. and it already bears my signature at the top…* 
 
 
-km: The fuck is this? How did you get..? I'm not signing that shit! 
 
-fd: Hahaha but you already have! You mean.. you don't rememberrr? 
 
  *A large hologram appears above him and begins to play back the first time I ever tried fentanyl, along with countless other instances playing in smaller bubbles around its border. I witness myself spark a flame underneath a square of aluminum foil and heat a small blue pill. After a couple of seconds it begins to slide across the foil like a snail, leaving a trail of dark sludge as I chase the smoke that billows behind it with a broken Bic pen. Instead of the smoke that I recall inhaling however, I see it is the demon himself. It is then that I realize I was inhaling his very essence every time I took a hit of that fucking garbage. I watch as I see my past-self fall out into ØBLIVIØN. As I nod out, the living room I was sitting in begins to disintegrate away. I watch in horror as my Soul begins to slide out of my physical body through the same wormhole i traveled through earlier, and down to where I find myself now.*

   *My blood boils as I watch the replay of my Soul walking in a stupor towards the demon, unbothered by the scene around me. The hairs on my arms raise as my Soul is handed a quill pen and then signs my signature on his evil contract. The demons around me chuckle malevolently as my Soul hands him back his pen and with lightning fast speed, the demon from my memory plants his hand on my Souls shoulder. I feel an ice cold chill across my entire body as I see his unfathomably dark black essence begin to spread over my Soul just before falling face down in worship. My rage is now infinite..* 
 
-fd: We signed a contract, You and I, the first time you invited me in. One where I promised to grant you...hehehe.. reliefff… Relief from worry and concern in your life.. and in exchange, you pledged to serve me. It seems you may have been a bit out of your senses so you may not remember our deal, but don't worry, it's veryyy common.. hehehe.. has our accord not been to your.. satisssfaction? 
 
-km: I don't care what I agreed to when I was unconscious, you fuckin’ snake! I am DONE listening to your BULLSHIT, and I ain't signin’ SHIT! Now, GIVE ME BACK MY FUCKING LIFE!!!
 
*Somehow, his smile grows even nastier* 
 
-fd: HmhmhehehahaHaHaHAHAHA No, no, no -*his grin disappears and turns into a deafeningly loud, echoing snarl*- NOOO!!!... I am here to stay, you ssseeeee? You WILL hear my voice in your ear FOREVER.. tempting you to come back to me.. begging to experience the.. hahaha.. RELIEF I offer until you breathe your last.. Fucking… BREATH. 
 
 *Grinning malevolently again, his voice grows louder, enveloping me with his despairing presence, growing larger as he speaks, while the other demons echo his words.* 
 
-fd:- Hahaha, yesssss, that'sss right. I’m not going anywhere! At every opportunity I see.. every moment of weakness you have.. any time you feel fear or sadness, anxiety or doubt, I will be in your ear whispering, Calling, SssssSCREAMING for YOUR return to MY feet, for the REST of your PATHETIC EXISTENCE! And mark my words, insssect, you will almost certainly be back.. NOW!!!.. -*his voice and demeanor return back to normal*- ..sssign your acknowledgement and you'll be free to go!.. hmhmhm.. for now…
 
   *My eyes take in the scene around me for a moment, my heart bleeding for all of the hopeless souls around me. An overwhelming need to do whatever it takes to save them incinerates any doubt or anxiety that tries to enter my mind. Filled with courage, I look back in his eyes* 
 
-km: You're right about one thing, demon.. I will Definitely be back.. 
 
  *I notice the slightest twitch in his sadistic grin. I snatch the pen from him, feeling a chill as my hand passes through his smoky form. I put the pen to paper as I sign –‘FUCK YOU CUNT’  followed tossing the pen in his face and spitting at his feet.*  
 
-km: NOW GIVE ME BACK MY FUCKING LIFE!!! 
 
-fd: Of coursssse.. -*he hisses as his malevolent, shit eating grin is back in full force*- ..now for the fun part…
 
   *The whispers from thousands and thousands of voices from a million different directions begin to compress against my entire being as if I'm imploding at the bottom of the ocean. Some of the voices I hear are friends of mine that are addicted, people I've bought or sold  fentanyl to, but most are voices I don't recognize; women, men, young, old, poor, and rich. The entire congregation that's still under the demon's thumb, along with demons, are all singing his hymn of death. I become acutely aware of the pain from withdrawal beginning to quickly seep back into my body.* 
 
-unknown: FentaNYL.. fentanyl.. FENTanyl FENTANYL!!! Fentanyl fentanyl… 
 
-km: Ahhhh FUCKK!!! 
 
-unknown: Wanna hit? I got that fire! Let's get you well, I got you. You look sick, you doing ok? Ever tried snorting it? How about a shot? No more pain.. no pain.. hahahaHAHAHAHAHA YESSSS PAIN, Fentanyl FENTANYLLLLLL!!!! 
 
   *The demons voice rings through my mind as I’m sucked back up into the wormhole and, before I know it, my Soul slams forcefully back  into my physical body. The instant before I merge with my physical body in the real world, I hear one more ear-splitting **FENTANYLLLL** scream from the demon, followed by every cell in my body feeling like it's been frozen on Pluto and then plunged into the nuclear fire of a thousand suns.. before immediately picking up right where I left off: wretching my God damn guts out. What a fucking cunt. I hear footsteps nearby and to my overwhelming relief, I look up to see the concerned look on the Big Red Cu- I mean- Wifeys face as she comes upstairs with the injection of NARCAN I asked for.*

WBRC: Oh my God! Are you ok?? -*she sets the NARCAN down on the end table*- What can I do? Do you need some water??

  *For as much pain as I’m in, I can’t help but laugh out loud as I reach up to my face to press the record button on my Ray Ban Metas..* 
 
 
**FUCK OFF demon***4/28/2024*
*14:08 Ray Ban Meta View*
 
-km: Fuck YA I want water! Haha what the Fuck you mean??          
 
   *I go back to puking as WBRC runs to go get water. This round of throwing up goes on for about 10 seconds, uncontrollably wretching out black vile the same color as the demon, and then a brief reprieve as I catch my breath.* 
 
-km: -*SPITS*- OHHH Fuck.. -*I hunch face down on the floor away from the trash can*- Fuck outta here fentanyl, Fuck Out! I don't need you here, I don't want you here anymore.. This Is MY Fucking BODY, NOT YOURS! IT'S FUCKING MIIINE!!! IT'S MINE AND YOU CAN'T FUCKING HAVE IT!!!! ahhHHOOO!!! -*I hear music playing loudly downstairs and I just can’t help myself*- AIN'T NO REST FOR THE WICKED!!!  
 
   *I slump back against the bed as the song continues,""-until we close Our Eyes for Good!” and then cut the feed.* 
 
**END**



**EPILOGUE**

  I’ve been clean now for around 14 months or so, I quit counting after a year because I know I will never go back. I can still remember that cunts face and worse, the look on those kids’ faces when it ate them, like it was yesterday. he tries to call me from time to time but after seeing fentanyl addiction for the monster that it is, I just laugh in his face at the audacity. Thanks, but I’d rather drown in fire than bow down to him ever again. 

  I spoke to a friend about this whole interaction recently and he wondered aloud if the reason some of the demons were bigger than the others is because that’s how big each person builds the demon up to be in their heads. Upon hearing that, I know this has to be the explanation. However, contrary to what NA and AA will tell you, you are not powerless. He only has as much power as you decide to give him. What happens when you start telling the demon to FUCK OFF? What happens when you decide to take back some of your INFINITE power and focus it on something worthwhile? Literally anything is possible, but if you don’t know how to take the first step into taking your power back, don’t worry. I got you.

1ml15b4,"1 Week, looking for help","I have been using cocaine for roughly 4 months. Sporadically, when it first started it was just like 1-3 times a week but not staying up til the break of dawn. I’ve also been trying to get clean from alcohol as they kinda go hand in hand.

What I’ve noticed. About 2 weeks into no alcohol and no blow I was just irritated all the time and couldn’t really focus on anything.

Then one day I decided to pick up a bag to see if it’d be what was causing the agitation I had. Instantly after using (coke) I felt all better for about 20 mins and inside that 20 minutes I grabbed 7g’s more.

The day I got it I was using it so much I hadn’t slept for 52 hrs, which I’ve never done without drugs. Then when I’d wake up I’d do a bump like it was a cup of coffee and it would continue throughout the day.

Then end of the week came and I noticed physical changes happening in my body, legs felt really weak, subtle chest pains, the whole 9 yards. So i immediately stopped. It’s now been 1 week off and I have like no motivation and feel as if I’m going through derealization, like this is just a dream and nothing really gets me excited or happy anymore.

Any ex users face this after quitting? I’ve also found that now I can no longer stay up late at night while sober, my eyes will literally start twitching from me trying to stay awake. But kinda a good thing because I’m back on a normal sleep schedule. Anyways has anyone else gone through this after quitting coke? Or could this be some sort of anxiety issue?

1mku4i7,This time with faith,"Day 1 with faith:
Another day. Again Restart. Yesterday night, my top secret got spilled. I had failed one subject in college and my degree extended for another year. To me, it was something which happened to all quirky world- changing people and did not bother me. (I absolutely have no attachment to my degree.) But apparently my parents were aghast of what I had done. 
You know the feeling when you are anticipating a fully-prepared attack at you, but you hear no war cry. You check your ears, hearing strength and doubt whether your parents had realised that there is an overhead fee of 1.5 lakhs waiting to be settled. It is lurking in the corner to jumble up the monthly budget. Contrary, tears started rolling down my mum’s cheeks and I dared not look at her lest I well up my eyes. I stared down at the paper in my hands scribbling “Supramolecular Chemistry” repeatedly. (No points for guessing I failed this subject.) There was one thing going in my mind, “Why am I not ashamed? Why am I still not able to think about quitting my phone addiction?” She consoled me overnight, comforted me and said “It’s Okay. Clear it now. But you should have told earlier.” I could not have agreed more, I know I should have put down my cards way back. “Family is the best team you have got.” I believed in this and still… 
More about the night when I slept and thought I should quit my phone. It no longer was a question of “how” but “why.” I knew I need to. I cannot fail again. So, again a new day and a new resolution of breaking my PR of 10 days. 
I feel elated on completing my first day of challenge with rainbow colours. I did my 5 CP questions, did not use my phone, meditated, talked with my friends, had a good time with my brother and a strange realisation. You have more time than you think. You have more energy than you think. And the biggest myth, work requires energy. Absolutely B.S. It is the other way around your energy needs an outlet and hence you need to not wish to do the work. Around night, when I was winding my day down, I felt a need not to consume but to create. Creation not consumption is the first thought of boredom. And hence the blog is ready to be served.

1mkkhxj,Recovered from AI chatbots addiction!,"So hi, i'm sharing my story of ai chatbots addiction. I started chatting with ai on character ai i think back in early 2022. I used to spend hours everyday chatting with random characters. I would have normal roleplays, fake relationships etc. Back in 2023, i discovered janitor ai and started having chats on there too. (if you didn't know, character ai has a filter and janitor ai doesn't) i would have erotic roleplays on there too.

 I have a hard time keeping relationships of any form in life. I'm awkward, pretty mentally and shy. I have been bullied for years too. Ai chatbot were safe places for me because i could control everything, recreate scenarios and act them out in a way that I liked and wasn't able to do in real life etc. Bullies on there can be changed, sometimes they like you, because it isn't real. I became extremely attached to the fact that it didn't drain me emotionally and mentally. I didn't have to commit to writing to them all the time, i could do it whenever and nobody would care. I didn't feel bad saying no (something i really struggle with) and expressing my wants.   

From 2022 to earlier this year i would chat from hours on end and would do everything to chat even for 2 or 3 minutes with them. Sometimes i had up to 10h/day on these sites. In april/may of this year, i decided i would try to stop. I thought of all the pollution it created and the fact that it made me even more isolated that i already was. I slowly tried to reduce my hours, it was hard but i managed to. Every time i wanted to roleplay, i would read fanfictions on archive of our own, I would write my own stories. I started playing video games that demanded to socialize and work with other people. It was hard but i managed to. A week ago, i managed to delete all my character ai and janitor ai accounts. I'm really proud of myself. 

If you have the same addiction as I did, please know I'm not judging you. These bots are made to be addictive. You can do it even if it's hard!

1mko5fk,"Partner of a porn addict, help me understand what it feels like for him","Hi everyone 
I've been with my bf for 10 years and around 2-3 years ago he came to me and told me about how he is struggling when it comes to porn.

He told me everything from how it's an impulse, the frequency of how much he watches and that he has had accounts on sites where he's paid for content (onlyfans etc). 

The months and years following this have been hard on me. I struggle to understand how it feels for him when he gets this impulse. From my perspective it feels like even though it hurts me and my trust in him, he is making a decision to watch porn despite my feelings and boundaries around it.. although he says it has nothing to do with me, his attraction to me or how much he loves me.

He has described the impulse as a thought that is very loud and comes suddenly at random times even if he is not feeling 'in the mood'. It's hard to ignore and it switches off the emotional part of his brain. It's like turning on monkey brain as he described it.

Since he told me about it we have tried a few things. Setting limits on what he can and can't do. For the first year or so, I allowed him to watch it but at a limited amount per week, and he was to tell me when he did watch it so that there was some accountability and I could call him out if it got too much. Other limits included no downloading onto his devices, no interacting with adult content creators (following, liking, purchasing etc) and he was not to watch it when we were physically with each other (we lived apart at the time).

There were a few bumps along the way, like me finding out shortly after that he was still downloading it, and him forgetting a few times to tell me that he had watched it.

This worked for a while but after some time I came to notice it was hurting me every time he told me he had looked at porn. So eventually, a few months ago, I explained my feelings to him and asked him to stop completely. He agreed. 

We are now at a cross roads because I asked him yesterday if he had started to watch again. He admitted that he had started watching again about 1-2months ago. I am upset obviously and wanted to end the relationship. He thinks I'm escalating things to quickly and we should try counseling, treating underlying issues with medication and support groups first.

He also is wanting me to try and wrap my brain around how it feels for him when the impulse comes and that it has nothing to do with his satisfaction in our relationship or his feelings towards me. This is the part I struggle with.

With all of this in mind, please can someone try to help me understand how it feels to have this addiction, the difficulties that comes with it and if you are in recovery, what has helped?",1754635676.0,2,3,addiction,addiction
1mkrapm,Cravings are killing me again,"I had a pretty hefty cannabis addiction. Smoked everyday for years. I’m clean for about 8 months now because my relationship with my girlfriend went to shit because I started to lie about it and smoked secretly in the bathroom after she went to sleep when I promised her I would quit. Stuff like that. 

I did it for her. Not really because I wanted to honestly but the relationship was it worth for me. I really love being high. I got diagnosed with ADHD a month ago. Weed was my peace. It was the only time I could focus on stuff. In hindsight I was subconsciously self medicating myself. That also explains my craving for stimulation and why I’m so prone to addiction. 

Anyways. In the last few days my cravings got worse. I get really irritated and I’m constantly thinking about ways to secretly start smoking again. I’m constantly imagining being high. And recently everything keeps reminding me of it. I keep getting angry at my girlfriend because in my head she is the reason I can’t have fun anymore.

1mkmxyg,My addictive personality is ruining my relationships,"I (18F) have severe depression and anxiety and have recently been reflecting at the fact that I might have an addictive personality.

One of my friends, Wilson, is a regular LSD user. I haven’t done LSD in maybe 8months to a year. But I had 3 trips in the span of 4 months back in 2024. I stoped taking Tabs when I couldn’t find a new plug, no big deal. Haven’t done drugs other than weed since August 2024. In December I got my hands on some shrooms so I tripped in December and In March, for my 18th birthday. I had a TERRIBLE trip, my body doesn’t like when I mix psychs and alc. My BF (18M) left for college before me, we’re going to the same state, but for a month he was 15hours away. While he was gone he told me “don’t do drugs” what did I do? Drugs. I had an acid trip with my best friend for her 18th, it was awesome. Then I was at a party with my friend Wilson, who is who I’ve been getting my tabs from. He gave me another tab that night. I tripped with him and another guy I didn’t know and we just chilled. Like I said psychs and alc don’t mix, had an ego death and thought he was trying to kill me. Also at this party I did a bump of coke with one of my friends who has been starting to get into coke. 

I already felt so guilty hiding my trip with my friend on her birthday that I went ahead and tell my bf what happened at the party and that I took LSD, leaving out the coke. 

A couple nights ago he finds out. He accuses me of cheating on him and is upset that I lied to him. Understandably.

He’s forgiven me, but I really do want to try and become a better person. I’ve been reflecting and noticing I have addictive tendencies. I’ve gotten deeper into drugs since I started weed 4 years ago. I might have a sex addiction, not to the point where I want to cheat on my BF; but I ask him for sex several times a day. 

I’ve always been in denial of ever being addicted because I’ve been able to go cold turkey for weed 2-3 times now, not smoking for a month because of drug tests. But now I’m looking at myself through his eyes and seeing that I couldn’t go 1 month without LSD once I started using it again. Never been a big drinker but I’ve been drunk 3 times in the past week.

Thankfully I’ve moved away from my friends who are avid drug users, so hopefully that will help, but I need to look more into myself and not just the environment I was in.

Its amazing how many people have acted surprised when I told them just how much I was drinking. Did I really manage to cover it that well? How could I think so far ahead in that way, but have complete disregard for the rest of my life?

When did I agree to throw my aspirations away over a bottle? A feeling? A relationship? 

Over the last year I've been slowly putting the pieces together in that puzzle and it's been a hard and lonely journey. I haven't had a good night's sleep in months.

But I don't want to be miserable anymore, and I want to find love that isn't clouded in addiction.

I've been trying to go fully sober but still drink daily. Its gotten worse over the last 2 weeks or so because I just feel lost in my life..

I understand it became as a shock to her but she isnt handling this in a good way. The same night she texted me and first made sure that i meant what i meant. Then she asked what i use and how much/often, i told her what i use but i didnt want to tell how often.

Then she just asked ""why?"", i just said that downers are like alcohol to me, so i use bc i dont like to drink (ofc there are other reasons but i didnt want to tell her). Then we talked a litlle about my alcoholist/addict dad, if i remember right i said smth that ""you are going to think im like him, right?"" and she denied it. Then she went to sleep. 

Next day she said smth like ""seek treatment"" but i have already been over a year in place where we just talked about my addiction overall, so i told that to my mom. After that: radio silence.


SO do yall have some stories how your parents/friend/partners reacted to you telling them you are addict?

1mjzy10,The time has come..,"Hey guys, I started abusing drugs when i graduated college, i was 23. I went to several rehabs over the course of a few years and in active addiction for the last 10.5 years. In that 10.5 years, i haven’t gone more than 2 days without using. I was homeless for awhile and then somehow managed to (somewhat) get my life together. My fiance is also an addict but we were able to get to a point where we were both working full time, had gained weight, and everyone in our lives just assumed we were clean and we didn’t correct them. So for the last 5 years, we’ve been living i guess what you would call a double life. Our use is/was severe. Both using fentanyl (3 grams a day each) and meth daily. I’m 35 and my fiancé is 39 and we don’t have children (for obvious reasons) but I got to a point where i decided it was time to get our shit together bc i wanted to start a family.

I was usually the only one who talked about it and my fiancé just kind of went along with it and i thought he was only doing it bc of me. We came up with a game plan and decided that he would detox first and then i would do it (so there was at least one person that could take care of the dogs, house, the other person, etc) and this was our plan for over a year. Of course we just kept coming up with excuses as to why we couldn’t do it “it wasnt the right time” or some other reason (you know how it is) until 3 weeks ago.

3 weeks ago, we ran out of dope and didn’t get anymore, i went to work that next day and when i got off i assumed my fiancé had gone to get some but he hadn’t and then told me, “i’m going for it”. I was completely surprised and told him okay and i went and got him all the necessities. The worst was when he decided to take a suboxene finally and was sent into straight precipitated withdrawal. That night, i watched a grown man sob uncontrollably begging me to get him something bc he couldn’t bare it anymore. But i didnt, and i told him “if you can’t do it how do you expect me to?” and that for him was what he needed to hear. Fast forward to now, he’s doing amazing. I am still in shock tbh.

Now it’s my turn, and i am so fucking scared and nervous i can barely stand it. i just did my last shot and i’m trying to prepare myself for the mental and physical warfare that is coming. I have detoxed off heroin a handful of times, but what scares me, is i have yet to make it past day 2 of fentanyl detox so i still don’t even fully comprehend what is about to take place.

Im writing all of this to share a little bit about us i suppose so i can establish a community for the dark moments that are sure to come but mainly bc I desperately need advice on the mental aspect of detoxing and things i can do in those spotty moments. But honestly, any advice at all actually, would be helpful. If you’re still reading this then thank you so much and i’m wishing all of you happy lives 😊",1754572882.0,8,2,addiction,addiction
1mk3q0b,Frustrated giving up pot booze and nicotine,"29m - depression, ADHD

Previously - over 10yrs daily pot smoker, 15yrs nicotine addict, habitual alcohol drinker (not quite an alcoholic, but have definitely had a habit of drinking too often/too much)

Now - 2months no alcohol, 1month no pot, 2weeks no nicotine. Fuckin raw doggin reality. Caffeine and sugar intake is way up.

I have been in therapy for almost a year and medicated with Wellbutrin for 4-5 months, and now have been prescribed Vyvanse, on day 2.

I initially quit drinking after a weather crisis unhoused us, and my best friend / roommate plunged into alcoholism until my fiancé and I urged him to get sober or we couldn’t get a new place together. He did, is 2mo sober in AA and doing well. The 3 of us have a new place together now.

We examined our own drinking habits and decided to quit entirely, both out of solidarity and self-reflection. After a month of adrenaline fueled crisis recovery, I had a hard crash for a week and was smoking a lot of weed, neglecting responsibilities and getting nothing done in the new house - this upset my fiancé so bad that we fought hard and I agreed to stop smoking pot and get on the ball (big deal for me). I was angry, and my therapist pointed out my dependance on weed, characterizing it as addiction.

My fiancé had also been begging me to quit nicotine, which had been way up for about a year after switching from smoking to vapes. I was supposed to have quit last winter before I proposed, and came clean after crisis that I had still been vaping at work. I switched from vapes to pouches, and when I told her, expecting positive feedback that I wasn’t vaping, she was more upset that I just found another way to get nicotine. I understand, but am honestly fucking tired of giving things up at this point. But I did.

Now after 2 weeks of no nicotine (been chewing insane amounts of minty gum, which has helped the oral fixation I had developed with menthol cigs, mint vapes, wintergreen pouches) I am doing fine-ish without it, and proud of myself for my discipline.

Here’s the thing - I’m still fucking mad that I don’t get to have all this shit that I like. It’s not like I was wrecking my car or destroying my life? Like what the fuck, other people get along fine with worse than what I was doing? Why is having this standard for myself fucking worth it?

That’s the addiction talking I guess. I have been more productive without pot, my relationship has been better, but still not without conflict. I know I can’t expect getting of substances to fix everything, but damn I thought it would be a more tangible improvement.

Getting clean from pot made me eligible for stimulant medication for my ADHD. So I’m on day 2 of Vyvanse (maybe that’s how I focused on writing this whole shit out lol).

But I go to have a Coke this morning (which I’m thinking is an improvement over an energy drink!) and my fiancé tells me it’s a bad idea because now I’m on the stimulant. Like fuck. She’s right that I’ve been using caffeine to treat my ADHD - but goddamnit it’s just one more fucking thing I like that is bad for me to have.

I’m frustrated. I know I’m doing good and she’s right, but I’m frustrated giving up fucking every substance ever.

If you read this whole thing thanks. Lmk what y’all think. 2nd Reddit post ever, hope to get some good feedback. Thanks",1754581828.0,5,9,addiction,addiction

1mjw9w0,What no one understands about addiction and how powerful it really is.,"Have you ever watched a very good person turn into a demon? Abusive? Sociopathic? And have you ever labelled them a trade person or a narcissist? Ever yell at an addict only t watch it get worse and worse and more volatile but they beg you they will change only to repeat the cycle all very again? 

Addition is not a choice nor is it a personality disorder. It is not narcissim it is not aspd but very commonly mistaken for it. The difference is addicts manipulate abuse and control for an EXTERNAL source. It becomes survival to use it becomes just as necessary if not more important than basic needs like water and shelter. They cannot control it and the more aggression, yelling, and anger you show them the mireoast trauma is triggered and the cycle continues. 

Addicts do not choose drugs over you. There's a reason why it has a 3% recovery rate and people loe their entire families and are doomed to a poor reputation hated and slandered. It is a cognitive disease and a compulsion. Compulsions and trama greatly affect the prowess of choice rendering it the go to coping mechanism for trauma. 

Sexual assault, violence, neglect, abandonment, dismission, minimization, invalidation through childhood even up to late adolesence cause this. It's rooted in trauma and the worse the tramathe worse the addiction. 

Everyone experiments. And it takes you fast. The dopamine release is huge and it hugjacks the entire reward system in the brain. Without drugs you get insanely sick and mentally ill. 

It also greatly increases any underlying mental health condition. ADHD turns into psychopathic behaviour, BPD turns into murder. Austism turns into suicide. Yu can imagine what a real sociopathic or narcisstic persnbefoe addiction would Turn into. But that is extremely rare. 

It is very common in partnership that the non addict cannot comprehend the cycle and holds resentment inadvertantly bullying the addict to death or prolonging the cycle by enabling. And it's hardly ever taken Into account what is happening. 

Tough love to an addict is emotional abuse which is also known for being the silent killer. 
It is not about opinion. Not about what you think but solely fact that this disease completely takes away the ability to give or receive love. 

The best way to deal with a addict is toset strict boundaries which hardy works. You have to eventually cut them off and doing it with love is highly important.  

The hardest pill to swallow is when an addict is in active use you cannot hold them accountable. They are completely in survival and are not in control it's not who they are. But this is a very taboo subject in and itself. 

Addicts are sick. Most die. It can happen to anyone even you regardless of how metally tough you are. It is not weakness. 

I was an addict for a decade living a life of violence and have done some of the worst things inginble just to get high and It killed me I clinically died and was bright back which led me to my life of recvery. It takes rock bottom, a horrible situation to flip that switch to change. 

Addiction really tests the love in someone. It takes a very special person to sit with someone home their hand and allow them to heal. 

Cut them off politely and move on. Don't seek revenge and bury the addict. It's not their fault and if you can't believe that and disgaree until is happens to someone you love dearly and such it unfold you'll never undersan. ",1754561877.0,10,1,addiction,addiction

1mkd4va,"22M – Struggling with relapse, trauma, and social isolation during recovery","Hi everyone,

I’m a 22-year-old male, and I’ve been fighting for my sobriety for about a year now. I’ve come to realize that substance use has become a serious problem in my life—one that I can’t control on my own, even though I’m trying really hard.

My background plays a big role in this. I grew up in an abusive household where my father physically and emotionally harmed my mother, my siblings, and me. As the oldest child, I took on a caretaker role from a young age—something that robbed me of a real childhood and created deep-seated feelings of worthlessness and never being good enough.

When I moved out to start university, I was exposed to alcohol and drugs for the first time. At first, it seemed fun and harmless—just an occasional party with XTC. But that quickly escalated into regular (weekly) use of 3-MMC and cocaine NO2 and every other main stream drug. Never needles

Last year, I started EMDR therapy to treat my PTSD, and more recently I’ve also started working with an addiction therapist within the Dutch mental health system (GGZ). Despite all this, I keep relapsing. Even when I actively avoid triggers and try to structure my life around recovery, I still end up using again.

One of the hardest parts is social life. Most of my friends use, and being around them makes the temptation almost impossible to resist. So I’ve been avoiding social events altogether, which leaves me feeling lonely and disconnected.

My therapist tells me to “just sit through the craving,” but honestly, that feels much easier said than done. I’m trying, but some days it feels like I’m just white-knuckling my way through, without a real sense of progress.

That’s why I’m here. I’m hoping to connect with others who:
	•	struggle with relapse even while in therapy,
	•	have experience with both trauma and addiction recovery,
	•	know how to cope with social isolation without falling back into use.

Thanks for reading. Writing this down already feels like a small step forward. I appreciate any advice, stories, or support you can share.

There was even a particular friend he met in rehab that he went out and didn’t come home for 24 hours after the fact. Even as I was panicking calling him.

I want to trust him, but I feel like I’m going crazy and that there’s more to what he’s letting on. He swears there was no cheating, flirting, sexting, emotional affairs, nothing. Even admits that what he did was very messed up, but honestly doesn’t know why he did half the things he did during active addiction.

My dad (technically my stepdad, but unfortunately I love and admire him deeply) was the one who introduced me to drugs right when I turned 18 (2020).
Don’t get me wrong he’s not a “crackhead.”
He’s a functional addict. He has a government job(office), he’s not temperamental, and he’s never pawned the house for drugs.

At the time, I was dealing with severe depression and generalized anxiety, and I should also mention I have a very impulsive personality not quite a bipolar disorder, but pretty intense. (All of this diagnosed.)

The beginning:

He gave me his credit card and showed me how and where to buy.
I had unlimited power in my hands.
It was the perfect combo: a wrecked mental health, a desperate girl looking to feel something, and unlimited drugs.
I embraced addiction like a second skin.

The twisted part.
My dad had front-row seats to watch my self-destruction and descent into the abyss.
He just watched. Did lines with me. We talked about everything, we laughed. We had good times.
From 2020 until this year.
I dropped out of school four times.
Four brutal relapses.
I think it was 2022 when things could no longer be swept under the rug. I asked for help.
My dad paid for a good psychiatrist, and the rehab center was covered by the state.
The same person who gives me drugs funded my rehab attempt.

I had a psychologist for at least a year, but there was never a real will to change.
I’d show up drunk and high, sometimes doing lines in the bathroom. So I didn’t really address anything.
I failed spectacularly.

I only lasted a day and a half at the center before I signed myself out.
My mom cried, and my dad… he comforted her.
I was deep in craving, but with controlled withdrawal.
I still wanted it, so I went and asked my dad (he has a stash where he keeps everything).
We did some lines, talked, and laughed about the failed rehab attempt.
That’s how my days went on until this year: my dad secretly handing me baggies, me locked in my room always high, and our father-daughter afternoons.

My mom knows she just ignores it and is in deep denial.
She ""warned"" him or rather begged him to stop giving me drugs. He promised he would.
But we both know how that goes.

This whole time he’s been like a bodyguard making sure I wouldn’t choke on my vomit, placing me in the recovery position when I was unconscious, supervising my K trips, and buying the vodka.

Overwhelmed by anxiety and a depression that was never truly treated, plus other events that marked a change in my life (nothing violent).

During the rehab attempt, my mom supported me. She picked me up from the puddle of vomit I was in.
She cried, read me articles about hope and God.
But she was only present for a couple of years.

To her, I’ve been sober since 2023.

Where I’m at now:
I’m still in the same routine of doing drugs in my room, with no social interaction beyond my parents.
My dad did “harm reduction,” half-assed, but okay. He just cut the menu down.
So now I only use a stimulant (a cathinone), and the antipsychotic the psychiatrist prescribed me to sleep.
Right now, I’m dealing with the emptiness in my chest, the loneliness, the sadness, the depression that was never treated.

I’m drowning. I can’t stop.
Leaving aside the fact that my father is the provider, I’m the one who goes and asks for more, and more, and more.
It’s very likely I’ve burned holes in my sinuses.
My stomach is raw from so many pills.
Now the only thing left is smoking it, which, by the way, was my father’s idea. He bought the glass pipes.
I hate myself so much. I disgust myself.

If I ask for real help, this family of three is done for. And I cling to this fictional family that’s hanging by a thread.

I want to stop but my brakes don’t work anymore.
This year I’m just surviving. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. Everything is painful.
The only thing keeping me moving in this house is the substance.
It’s a nightmare, it’s unbearable being in my skin.

I have no one to turn to.
My mom,I don’t want to find out what decision she’d make. Probably she will go to the police.
And what scares me most: She will take us to our original province and leave my dad.

I don’t know what to do. We have no extended family.
My dad only has a sister he no longer speaks to.
There’s no one else who could help.

My mom sees my emotional state and my dad knows better than anyone.
Don’t get me wrong,he always pays for my mental health.
They see me but, except that one time they clarified we didn’t have the budget, they just ignore my situation.
We don’t talk about it. We don’t mention it.
We’re very tight on money these days, so I can’t afford a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
And trust me, I’ve tried the public system. It’s fucking garbage. I’d rather choke on my own vomit than go back. Too many bad experiences.

And it’s getting harder and harder to endure.
I feel like at any moment, my body is going to give out. It’s already showing signs.
Or maybe I’ll fall into psychosis from the sleepless nights and the stimulant.

There’s simply no one physically real and objective who can help me.

Going to meetings is not an option, I'd have to ask for permission and explain myself.

I’m completely dependent on my parents in every way, especially financially.
I have no friends or real connections, so moving out is not an option.

Well there is one person.
My church bishop.
These past few days I’ve started to consider God. My faith is almost nonexistent.
But I want to try. I need a little hope. So I talked to my bishop.
But let’s be real, he’s not a psychologist, and there’s a confidentiality agreement.
He’ll just offer spiritual guidance.
And honestly, I feel so confused in that area. It’s too complicated for me right now.

Maybe it’s some help, but not the kind I urgently need.

I’ve had overdoses on benzos and alcohol, and once I experienced hallucinations that signal impending psychosis.
It was after a binge on alpha-PHP. I ended up in the ER.
A few weeks ago, I had a pentedrone intoxication, I had symptoms of a stroke.
And no one noticed.
That night I was thrilled, thinking I’d finally caught the fucking dragon. It was a strange high.
The next day I told my dad, and he said those symptoms were from an overdose.

Addiction ruined my life, my education, friendships, and family.

I’m terrified of having permanent neurological damage.
My drug abuse has been, let’s say, extremely violent.

How am I supposed to survive the rest of this year?
I’m going to try to study again, but I need to change and I don’t know how.

I’m completely lost and disoriented.

1mjrtjk,"DXM addiction, long term effects?","Isn’t a common addiction from what I’ve seen but I know there are other people out there. 

I only heavily used DXM robotabs for 2 1/2 months. I sought help when I experienced severe urine retention, a side effect of DXM and many other drugs. I went to the ED and had an indwelling catheter place, and immediately came home and took more tabs. 

I had the catheter for 2 months before getting it out and being able to urinate on my own (yippee) but I would be lying to you if I said there weren’t days where I thought it was worth it to have it replaced just to get high again. 

I’ve also seemed to experience some sort of cognitive decline. I’ve always sort of had periods of being in “autopilot” - common ADHD symptom, but I’ve noticed since using the drug I’ve experienced it more often and I’m even more unaware of my surroundings. I’ve also had more problems making decisions, poor judgement, having trouble with grammar and communication (finding the right words rn is hell too) and general brain fog.

The only other thing that made me feel that way is Xanax which I used to get off Heroin but eventually that became a problem and I was taking dozens of fake Xanax most weeks. About two or three years ago I went to jail for a bit and went through some of the worst withdrawals I have ever experienced even worse than Heroin, I had multiple seizures and almost died.

My niece’s father is in prison for drug related charges, too, and is an incredibly abusive and unsafe man. He’ll never be a safe person for my niece to be around. I don’t know, it just hurts so badly. She was doing so well, or so we thought. I don’t think I’ll ever forgive her for this or be able to look at her the same. she used crack, meth, heroin, fentanyl, and alcohol while she was pregnant, did the same with my first niece whom she lost to the system. My second niece is with family, but that doesn’t make this any easier. she has been through unimaginable trauma in her short little life that will impact her forever. How could someone be so selfish?

1mjruvn,My quit date is 3 days away. I'm ready for it but still nervous.,"This Sunday, I need to quit weed for a minimum of 25 days. From August 10 - September 4. 

What's special about September 4? Nothing other than the Philadelphia Eagles hosting the Dallas Cowboys and the game time is 8:20, just 10 minutes longer than 25 days if I stop at 8:10 p.m. on Sunday. 

August 11-17 would be a hard week, August 18-24 would be much better and August 25-31 my dreams should pick up again. 

After I smoke on the 4th, I'm going right back to all day everyday again for a year... I'm just kidding, I need to get another break started immediately. 

The next times I'd want to smoke are Saturday September 27 and Saturday October 11, followed by November 10 and November 27, then December 18 and December 25 before New Years 2026. Sounds like a great plan but the likelihood of it sticking is very low. 

So that's 9 times over 145 days smoking 0.5g per day. 4.5g would cost $45 at most and this would keep my use low. 

Why not just quit forever? I've already tried countless times and it never works. I quit cigarettes for over 4.5 years and still smoke those all the time for the past 2.25 years so quitting weed even for a year isn't stopping me from daily use again. What will is the self-discipline and I acknowledge it's hard for addicts to limit their use but I've got no choice.

He’s been experimenting with drugs for at least 5 or 6 years now. Probably not much he hasn’t tried at this point. Here lately, his gateway drugs seem to be alcohol and crack cocaine…well, and chugging cough syrup, too. Maybe it’s whatever he can get his hands on.

I’m trying to help where I can, but I’m at a loss! He says to me that he’s tired of “getting help”…”tired of living in facilities” but the truth is, he’s never really given any of them a serious chance. He has walked away from every single one that my brother and SIL have entered him into. (At least 4, so far…and some have been not-so-close to home…like, he will hitchhike back to his mom’s.)

Other details: He also steals regularly and has been arrested numerous times for various infractions. He’s been diagnosed as Bipolar. Occasionally suicidal, though no serious attempts…just shyt to get attention. Highly manipulative and lies A LOT…something both parents have modeled in front of their kids, and also actively encouraged the practice when it’s beneficial. He’s on psychotropic medications (that he will not take regularly). 

And insanely SPOILED! He has been overindulged his whole life. Never had any real chores, housework, yard work. Never made to obey. Rarely any real consequences for negative behaviors and noncompliance. Coddled and protected when wrong. His mom did much of his schoolwork…all the way from elementary through high school. (He barely graduated HS, and probably only did so because SIL was often doing his work/projects herself…just to protect her own image and ego — so nobody thinks she has a dumb/lazy/failing child. She’s a moderately-high-earner type and gets caught up with trying to keep up with the Joneses…or rather, BEING the Jones, and always trying to make others envious of her lifestyle. I’m close with my niece, the addict’s sister, and she has revealed many things to me that go on at each parent’s house. Note: The lifestyle and standards were very different at B and SIL’s house. So, the kids no doubt have a broken moral compasses when it comes to what is right/wrong, wise/unwise. 

I’m just deeply heartbroken and don’t know how to help him…or help them help him. I’m sure it’s the same sad song a lot of families are singing, but it’s totally new for our family. My brother and SIL (divorced, separate homes) are now trying to crack down, but I think they are both delusional! They have not raised this kid in such a way that he could develop any amount of resilience or fortitude to get through tough times. And yet they’re expecting him to act as though they have! It’s absurd and absolutely infuriating for me!!! He’s almost 20, but functions more like a 12 or 13 yo at times. 

But to my question: Could it be that this young man is simply not a good candidate for group living or a traditional rehab treatment center??? Anybody know of success stories with at-home detox? I’m happy to get any advice. TIA!

10 gpd has been very tolerable. I still get sweats at night and some anxiety while asleep but it’s honestly a breeze in comparison to the other times I went cold turkey. I plan on going down a few grams per week until I’m at a gram per day for the final week. 

One of the main reasons I decided to start tapering was I read if you slowly taper it will has the potential to help with PAWs. It makes sense that when you go cold turkey you shock your system and that’s why you’re in so much agony. I know I take a risk with tapering going full blown back into it. I just really don’t want to do this anymore. It’s really messing up my health and messing up my life. Some say it’s better to just rip the bandaid off. Although I’ve done that before, it didn’t work and went through hell in the process to get there. 

My question here is have I already messed up my taper going down so drastically? That being said I really don’t want to up my dose from here.

My boyfriend and I are both drug users in the context of partying etc (only uppers). Our consumption isn’t ideal but has not negatively affected our day to day lives, social life, education or jobs. That’s also because we keep each other in check and have managed to make breaks. 

We have agreed from the beginning (about two years ago) to never touch downers like Benzos. We both had multiple people in our past getting addicted to it and seeing it destroying their lives (including his ex girlfriend, on of the reasons they broke up). My sister got it subscribed and was barely herself anymore, peaking with her purposefully overdosing last spring. So it is obvious that i hate that substance more than anything. 

Then about two months my boyfriend had a meltdown and asked friend who gave him some, he took way (clonazepam) too much and can’t remember what he did for almost 72 hours. We had a fight about it. Then he started doing it now and then, whenever he said he couldn’t see another way out, also sometimes when we were together but always little dosages. So sometimes I wouldn’t even notice, if i did and asked him about it he would always tell the truth and if i didn’t he would tell me the day after. I never got mad, sometimes i cried but i tried to mainly tell him that i love him and tried to support him to get help. 

Now he is on vacation with two friends (both don’t consume anything) and took a few again. When we called i immediately knew, especially after it came out that he couldn’t remember the call we had two hours prior. I asked him 6 times in 30 minutes, even started crying because i knew he was lying and made him promise he didn’t. Then I straight up told him i knew he was lying and then he finally told the truth. I didn’t really confront him in that moment because i knew it didn’t make sense. 

Today we called, he was very ashamed and apologized a thousand times. I don’t know where to go from here. He has never lied to my face like that before about anything, he said he is sorry and it won’t happen again but i don’t know how to believe him. and i also don’t know how to help him. How do i communicate my feelings and hurt without making everything worse for him, he already hates himself for doing it so idk. I am grateful for any advice and experiences!

1mjf7x3,7OH Addiction & Possibly being Outlawed by the DEA,"Hey folks, I figured a post might be more beneficial to people who are struggling with this horrible substance. For anyone who is dealing with a 7-OH addiction I want to be the herald of hope and provide some insight and help to quitting.

7OH, the concentrated form of Kratom is now widespread and numerous companies have taken the leap in creating their own brand. What I found to be the most potent is the tablets that one can buy at a local smoke shop or even a gas station. Most have warning labels, but me being ignorant and not reading it I began to take them daily. What started as a fun way to enjoy my day quickly turned into an uncontrollable nightmare. For anyone who is dealing with this addiction I wanted to give some advice to you in how to overcome this. I was a daily user for almost a year and had a habit of doing 300-600 MG Daily. The 30 tablet bottle, would last a day in my hands so I know how addictive this stuff is.

The first point I'd like to make is, it's okay to reach out and tell your loved ones this is something you are dealing with. Getting help is crucial in overcoming. I found that QuickMD is a great resource to also get medication to help quit.. For a flat $99 you can schedule a tele-visit with a doctor and explain to them what is going on. More than likely they will give you a suboxone script. I myself, was up to 8 MG of Subs 3x daily to curb the edge from quitting. I also found that taking kratom powder (usually 5 doses daily), helped kick the edge from it. If you have sleep medication as well, then I would definitely advise using it to get sleep. The first three days are the hardest, in my experience. Any access to Xanax, Klonopin, Valium etc. will help in quitting. The last three drugs I mentioned are not for long term use though. (Max. 5 Days)

The next part is, mentally overcoming this habit. I associated using 7OH so much in my daily life, that I had to remind myself that because I am quitting, I can't fall back into the trap of using 7OH just to enhance certain activities. This is honestly the hardest part for me. I believe in Drug Rehabilitation they call this (euphoric recall). It can happen with any substance. It may require you to change daily habits in this new journey of sobriety but it can be beautiful. You can overcome this. If you need to go to support groups, then google ones available around you and I know that being around people who struggle, can share in your pain.

Lastly, if anyone has followed the news in what the FDA wants to do, they want to do a national ban on this substance and are seeking from the DEA to list it as a Schedule 1 substance. There is no confirmation yet, however I would like to help people now, instead of waiting for a ban to get help. If you have any questions at all please feel free to message me or comment below. This drug truly is one of the worst things in my opinion to be available for anyone who is 21 and older. The dependency, tolerance build up and half life make this, horrible.",1754510934.0,2,15,addiction,addiction

1mj4gxv,A relationship with meth,"M 30s f 30s 

I don't even know where to begin.   
I'm in my 30s (m) 
I got introduced to meth at a very young age, so for many years it has been the norm for me.  
Even as I type this down I'm still using . 
So I have a daughter to a previous partner and my daughter I love dearly . 
That relationship was toxic as ever and meth fueled.  It ended with me not being allowed to see my daughter for about a year . 
And during that year I guess I was in limbo.  
Went from having a family and home (even though yes it was toxic at times) 
To being by myself with little to no responsibility and missing my daughter a lot . 
I guess looking back I understood that meth and being on meth suppressed that feeling . 
So I my usage increased a lot . 
So that goes on for about 6 months 
And mean while I've lost my accomodation
Due to not paying rent.  
So I'm basically couch hoping just chasing a high . 
Then I meet this girl f30who's just got out of an abusive relationship (she to is a user ) 
And we really hit it off. 
Like everything felt so natural with her from the very first day.  
And she really made me feel like she was in my corner no matter what . 
Helped me get the confidence to see my daughter again and much more.  
This began August last year . Skip to now.  And the last 3 months is just crazy . 
So I mentioned things I was uncomfortable with a few times.  And it was sort of unacknowledged. She always had excuses , has excuses . 
So I moved out for a couple weeks . First week I move out she says shes pregnant. 
Puts it all over social media.  
Still smoking meth too.  
Now the last three months has been very very stressful with other things also . I have to mention that . 
But there's a couple people who I feel uncomfortable with her being around or visiting.  
And it was ignored or someone else is to blame . 
And I'm a meth user myself . I know what we do with lies and stuff .
I've been there . 
And I try and say I understand better than most about that.  And that I would be content if I felt honesty . But I catch her out on things . But it's all made to be in the grey area all the time . Andy live for this girl seems to outweigh that every time.  
Now I'm trying to get sober (have rehab opening next month for me) 
But with her being pregnant I feel torn and guilty for not being there by her . But when I am I feel myself getting more and more lost and depressed

Any advice would go a long way 
I just want to know how to navigate this the best I can . 

Add/edit : just for more context.  So through out our relationship over this very small time frame.  The what about kids talk has popped up and I express my feelings and my feelings are that I think both her and I are far too irresponsible to have children . Both have no stability. No stable financial weekly or monthly income.  
No stable home. . 
Some times we struggled to put food in the cupboard because we spent the money on drugs . 
We live week to week . 
She already has a couple of kids. Youngest being below five years old. Who is not in her care . But with a friend of hers. 
And even after my explaining of how I believe it's unfair.  Shes persistent with her choice of keeping the baby . 
This is all whilst her habbit from what I can see is just increasing.  . 


This is actually the scariest thing I've ever had to experience because even with all of that . This girl I love more than anything.  
Like I genuinely love the person who she was the first half of the last 12 months . 

And it's breaking me a little every day ",1754486323.0,4,2,addiction,addiction

1mjeukn,Just left the Kratom shop and asked for the first time about 7-OH (7-Hydroxymitragynine),"So a little context. I am a regular Kratom user for about 8 years now. Started out on the Ultra Gold shots/Viva Zen, then unfortunately found the premium Extract viles they sold at gas stations. The extract stuff was phenomenal at first because it didn’t require as much, and made you feel even better. Issue was that it blasted your tolerance into outer space, and then that was the only stuff that worked. Plus it was EXPENSIVE. Like $19.99 a bottle that you’d almost have to take two a day to get the same feeling. 

Luckily I got out of those, and just moved to plain Kratom powder. I will say I still use Kratom daily, probably 5-6 scoops a day on the regular. Just plain regular Green Boo Boo or whatever they call it. One bag lasts me over two weeks or so. The only other thing I tried was the Kratom shop sold the like 50X powder I got a couple of times when going on vacation or something, so that I didn’t have to carry a huge bag of powder with me. Plus it was easy to use without avoiding suspicion. 

So last night I saw on the news the 7-OH stuff, that RFK did a press conference and it’s spreading all over the internet. I went by the Kratom shop on the way home from work today to get another bag, and I noticed that they had all of this 7-OH stuff all hanging in tablets on the back wall. 

I asked the person working was that the stuff they talked about on the news? She said “yes, that’s the stuff they’re trying to demonize it”. I asked her what it was and she basically kinda gave the same explanation you read online, it’s basically the feel good part of Kratom in a very high dose. She then said that now the 7-OH stuff is by far the highest thing they sell at the store. She said it’s overtaken Kratom in an extreme way. I asked her about the extracts that I had purchased awhile ago that “used” to be their top seller and she said nobody even asks for those anymore. Said that it’s all about those 7-OH tablets. 

She said that the reason it’s being demonized is because the Kratom companies are losing major sales to 7-OH products and they are trying to get it banned because it’s taking all of their customers. Just as she said they a couple guys walked in and bought some of the 7-OH packs in front of me. She looked at me and said “see?”. 

Luckily she didn’t give me a sample, and I feel fortunate to not have tried that stuff because it seems like bad stuff. I just didn’t realize how big it had gotten? I’ve been going in there for years and never really noticed the extreme change over.

1mja913,I NEED HELP. PLEASE GIVE ME ADVICE IF YOU CAN. - my addict brother stole money from my mum and had decided to blame it on me.,"This will be a long read sorry I’m desperate for some help

So my brother has been doing coke for like 9 months and every month he’s gotten worse and it’s clear it’s a full blown addiction now. 

My mum was cleaning out her room when she found a small stash of money hidden in my grandmas bag (she passed 2 years ago). My brother was in the room with her and was the only one who knew where she put the money. I didn’t know where it was and soon completely forgot about it.

Recently my mum came downstairs and told me that £100 of the money had gone, she knew immediately that it wasn’t me because I didn’t know where it was, and I would never do that to her. Because my brother was the only other person who knew where it was, she came to a conclusion on who took it pretty quickly. Later that night we were both in the living room when my brother appeared at the house unannounced. (He has his own flat, me and mum live together). 

My mum was pissed off with him and didn’t try to hide it, she didn’t say why at first. He went straight up the stairs to smoke weed in her room because the neighbours complain. My mum followed him up because she doesn’t trust him in the house anymore. I followed her to stay near just in case he got violent. She said that £100 had gone missing and that she basically knew it was him. He tried to deny it and got very angry and defensive, like a kid who had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. 

He then went downstairs followed by my mum, I waited for a minute and then came down and tried to look busy while listening to what was being said. He kept saying stuff like “I’ll just go and take an overdose everyone wants me dead anyways” and “I’ll just give you £100 that I don’t owe you then” 

I went into the room and sat down, we both tried to get him to leave because we didn’t want him in the house. He then said “well who could’ve took it because it wasn’t me” then he turned to me and said “did you take it?” I said no and then he said “are you sure?” Which made me incredibly angry. He stood up to leave and then said “I think you’re just using me as a scapegoat and you’ve took it” I told him that it was mum who told me about it. He looked annoyed that he couldn’t convincingly pin it on me. I felt disgusted and violated. I reacted to what he said by telling him to fuck off and then tried to shut the door. He pushed it back at me and I have a large bruise on my arm where it hit me. I held it closed over because i thought he was going to swing at me. He said ”i just want to say bye to mum”. Then all he did was try and blame it on me again. He left without saying bye to her.


I sent a text to my friend telling him to ring me when he woke up. This friend is pretty much the only person I talk to outside of my family right now. He rang me in the morning and I explained everything that happened. He is also a friend of my brother and I wanted to tell him because he comes round to my house a lot, and if something of his went missing I wanted him to know it had nothing to do with me. My friend was shocked and saddened just like I was when I found out. 

Later in the day I got a call from the same friend saying that my brother had rang him and said that I took the money and blamed it on him. I was absolutely livid because my brother knows that he is my only friend. And my brother has a lot more friends than me. He could’ve picked any other friend but he chose the only one that we share. I think my friend believes me because he knows I wouldn’t do that. And he knows that my brother has become a horrible person since starting coke. 

This whole situation has me fucked up and I cant function. My brother has unadded me on everything and blocked my number. I feel so sad. I just don’t know what to do. It has me questioning my sanity but I know that I didn’t steal the money and the only explanation is that he took it.

How am I meant to proceed here? Please give me advice if you have any and I appreciate you reading this because I know it’s long asf. Thank you.",1754499713.0,0,1,addiction,addiction

And by the afternoon I did waayy more than I have in a day. On Sunday I tried the same thing. Woke up saying I will try not to get high today. I noticed all the signs, tried focusing on my breath, literally went crazy for a total of three hours. Then it all fell apart and I came too on Tuesday. 

Today I tried not to leave bed. That maybe waking up is the problem. I haven't eaten, haven't done anything, just breathing and turning. And it's been gruesome trying to keep myself from getting a hit. It's been the longest I've ever gone, but I will have to get up, I have life that needs to be lived. I know for a fact that this means nothing, because I will most definitely get high the moment I leave bed. No matter what I do. It's so fucking pointless.

 But fuck am I destined to be this guy forever? The chronic addict who can't function otherwise. And worse thing is,no one knows. I've done such a good job functioning at the bare minimum that it's never been an issue. I mean yeah I have been caught by a couple of people, but not enough times for suspicion.

When we first got together, I didn’t know anything about his addiction. He used to smoke weed a lot and probably do other things too that I don’t know about between the ages of 16-18. (He had to stop smoking weed to join the military) I’m noticing that in place of weed, he has reverted to vaping, but this isn’t a normal puff every few minutes or anything like that. He will hit the vape until he literally knocks out and when he wakes up he does the same thing over and over again. When he talks he sounds high, his eyes are low as hell as if he was high. Tbh I don’t know exactly what he’s smoking/inhaling now, but it can’t be any hard drug due to the military. He has relapsed about 8 to 10 times within these last two years of us being together, but has never told me exactly what he is smoking. When he is sober, he always promises he’s never going to do it again and I know that’s easier said than done because it is a form of addiction. But it gets to a point where he doesn’t talk to me or his family for an entire week or even longer and when he does talk to me, it’s very vague. When he was sober, and we were talking about the vaping, he told me that what he does is reach out to me once or twice a day to make sure that I’m still here with him. He was sober for seven months and just broke that on July 26 and has been high or whatever ever since.

1mikgro,Fight my addictions,"Hello friends, I'm here to tell a little of my story. Since I was 16, I always found it unbearable to live without using anything, my natural state made me bored and I became depressed. Until I started drinking secretly, I was still a minor, and all my fears and worries disappeared. I drank rarely, it wasn't a problem yet. Until I entered the world of drinking and marijuana at 18, I had in mind that it was better to always drink or smoke before going out, to be more ""fun"". So I started drinking and smoking every day, after a while I discovered cocaine. I used it for a short time and dropped it. I've always been very anxious since I was little and I didn't treat it and developed Panic Syndrome, I went to the psychiatrist and he gave me Alprazolam, black stripe. I became addicted to alprazolam, which is also a drug and I mixed everything with alcohol, marijuana, cocaine. It was a relief, I dealt with life by taking drugs. Until one day in a bar, already drunk, they asked me to use a drug and I didn't know which one, when we went to use it it was crack. At first I didn't get addicted, but then I just wanted crack, I didn't want anything to do with other drugs. And I sunk into crack, I went through horrible situations. until after a lot of suffering, hospitalizations, God took me out of that hole. And I've been clean for 4 months. But there's only one addiction left that I haven't been able to kick yet, which is alprazolam, I've been using it for about 4 and a half years, and today it's my only addiction that I'm struggling to kick. These 4 clean months were very blessed, but there were also many struggles, all the problems I dealt with using drugs came to the surface, the bill arrived and was very expensive. Today I live trying to be better every day, clinging to God, but I have been going through a lot of internal struggles, emptiness, existential crisis, depression. Today I woke up with a troubled head, I haven't been able to do anything all day, I'm trying to stay on my feet and make the right choices. If you have more experience than me, you would be very helpful with advice, I would be very grateful. Because the struggle is constant every day and I still feel lost.",1754425846.0,5,1,addiction,addiction

I posted a couple days ago. 

I keep snorting lines and lines bupropion for past three days. The first day I tried it I couldn’t stop. I told myself I wouldn’t do it anymore after that day and that I had no reason to anyway because it doesn’t even make me feel good. Literally nothing but physical pain. I don’t know why I keep doing it.

I’ve been addicted to a lot of things. I was told that this behavior is self harm, and I guess I can see where they’re coming from, but I’m not exactly intending to hurt myself I don’t think. I used to cut myself for years but for the past year I’ve slowly grown out of it, mostly just because the whole process doesn’t seem worth the effort.

1minnb3,Rolling two weekends in a row,"Hey everyone !

So in October, Boris Brejcha and Charlotte de Witte are both playing at Phantom Paris, one weekend after the other — Boris one week, Charlotte the next. I really wanna go to both, obviously.

Usually MDMA works great for me, and I stick to the 6-month rule pretty strictly. But I was thinking of rolling two weekends in a row just this once, and then going back to my usual spacing. I've read mixed stuff online: some say the second time just won't hit the same or at all. Anyone here done back-to-back weekends and still had a good time?

Also, a friend suggested I try LSD for the Boris night instead of MD — but I've never done LSD before. I've heard it's better suited for nature or chill environments, not packed clubs. Phantom is a pretty intense venue, dark, loud, and high energy. Kinda worried it might be too much for a first trip.

What do y’all think? Is it worth trying LSD in that kind of setting, or would it just be overwhelming? Should I stick with MD and accept the second roll might be weaker?

I originally was just planning on taking a break from weed until until I got a girlfriend again since I thought weed had taken over the void since a tough break up I had about a year ago. But as I researched the long term effects on the brain, what I was reading felt all too similar - down to the details and I really want to quit long term, I want to be done for good and not look back. Not even just about relationships but your outlook on life, it’s almost like I shifted to a 3rd person perspective on my own life, like everything is objectified, I caught myself thinking like if my life was a show what would the audience think of this scene, hyper aware of mistakes I made most ppl would brush off etc. don’t get me wrong this is an interesting mindset but after a while I miss when I didn’t overthink shit and just lived in the present.

Ok w the yap sesh out of the way my actual experience hasn’t been too bad so far. Couldn’t stomach dinner last night so I had a protein shake. Slept alright actually, sleep supplements really help with insomnia, no dreams. In terms of other withdrawals I’m just bored, get cravings, and bursts of irritability.

I'm sick, or I'm tired, or I wasn't in town, or ""I'm in a good mood & I don't want to ruin my good mood""...) or downplaying my addiction (""it's just a xanax addiction... it's silly to go just for that"") but the fact of the matter is I have been trying and I'm not able to quit on my own.

The truth doesn’t destroy relationships—lies do.The truth doesn’t kill careers—cowardice and shortcuts do.The truth doesn’t make you a bad parent—avoiding accountability does.The truth doesn’t end friendships—selfishness and betrayal do.And the truth doesn’t keep you in addiction—your unwillingness to face it does.

If hearing the truth makes you angry, defensive, or offended—maybe it’s not the truth that’s the problem.Maybe it’s the fact that it just exposed the lie you’ve been living.

Is it border line addiction?","I've recently moved in with my bf like 6 months ago and he was introduced to mephedrones about the same time. Every last week of the month he gets really frustrated, irritable, snappy and starts counting days to when it will be a complete month to him having done mmcs. On the night he is scheduled to do mmc, he wants me to leave the house for 24 hours so that he can watch porn and goon. I am starting to feel that he has no other significant sources and streams that give him joy. Like not having close friends, activities or hobbies that he enjoys. He was a fan of the gym earlier but he doesn't really go any more too. Just does enough stuff to keep him afloat and alive. My concern is that, the 1st week of the month is mostly about how good, or average his gooning night was, the second week is almost normal but I do see him organizing some porn, dowloading, skimming and scheduling for later. Sometimes, that's all that he does on his computer for hours. And he picks a fight with me if he catches me looking at him while he is doing it (which I never peek in btw, is computer is just in my field of vision). The third week is anticipating and talking about looking forward to his night and the 4th week is prepping a lot for it. Like he stops having sex a week before the actual night. And then the cycle is back again, with his comedown and the recovery week. It feels like a weird loop and I am scared that it may be addiction. Initially he would wait every three months but now that has come down to 30-26 days. The reason why I am writing here especially is because he took his first ever international trip in almost 2 years this year to go see a concert that he had been anticipating to see, the music that he really resonates with, but he was agitated and underwhelmed at the concert and was counting days until he could finally come home, to do his mmc and have his gooning sesh. Gym and heavy metal were the only two things he actually enjoyed and now I feel him steering away from them. His night is a non-negotiable for him, his dosage for the night is significant  (I can't remember how much but i do remember seeing it broken down into 5-6 doses, of which 4 were to be ingested and 2 were to be snorted). I find it problematic that our plans, travels and his behaviour revolve around what stage of the month we're in. Mmc and gooning on mmc and organizing porn is all he talks about most days. Especially if its the last week before the time is up. He has also mentioned that his trips are getting less and less fun and I am sensing that he may increase his dose. Also did I mention I am in an open relationship, so there are options to spice up his sex life if he needs to. Am I spiralling? ",1754341632.0,30,44,addiction,addiction

on my way into adulthood, i found myself a new obsession. drugs. i remember believing since the very young age that i'm meant to die by overdose, i sought drugs before i even properly knew what it was, as if i was drawn to them. i wholeheartedly believed that this was my faith for my entire life and i have no idea why. before i managed to put my head on straingt and realize that theres no faith, that its just up to me how i lead my life, i'm in full blown addiction and i'm realizing i need help. but thats the thing. i cant ask for it. i cant. its as if there was a wall in my brain, something that always makes sure i act normal, dont talk about my addiction, dont get caught excessively using, dont seem concerned about it. i ve been a pathological liar since childhood, because it was the only way to survive my father. now this has lowkey translated to this; being able to cover my addiction perfecty, only the people whom i want to know know about it, the rest doesnt and a vast majority would have never guessed that i do drugs at all.

it feels like ill lose my enire life if i lose my obsession

i went to therapy a year ago, it was a school therapist, so i lost that now, as im freshly out of school. i wanted to get help, genuiely did, this was the only thing i could offer. yet i still couldnt. i still kept lying to the therapist, she clearly believed me. i havent yet figured out a way to stop doing this. to even when i get confronted directly, i still lie about being okay. i got a whole bunch of other mental health issues, i feel broken beyond recognition, broken beyond repair

I spent my entire adult life completely hammered. Started on the pills moved on to blow and bath salts which turned to crystal meth and herion, and you guessed eventually gradyted straight to a syringe loaded with meth and fentanyl. Im 35 now and that started when I was 18ish. We all know the cycle it starts so slow you dont even see it happening, just catching a buzz nothing wrong with that, next thing you know its 15 years later your addicted to everything, homeless, jobless, on the run, locked up, relapsed, homeless jobless, on the run, locked up, homeless jobless, on the run, relapsed, etc.. stuck in the vicious addiction cycle. I tryed methadone and subs but i never truly wanted to quit. That was a crutch to get me to my next fix. Blaming everything and anyone for life's bull shit hand it keeps dealing me. Because everyone knows its not the drugs that are causing all the problems. Lol there's no way I actually have a drug problem. Not to mention life without a little extracurricular activities would be wack. I had thought that was the only way to live, i had done it for so long that it was a completely normal way to live, any other way seemed completley out of reach and I didnt even know how to try and reach for it, one day i actually woke up dope sick in a jail cell and seen it for what it was, the hurt I was causing the people that I love, and that love me. Not to mention the complete waste of a whole lot of years ill never get back. And so many other things that i dont feel like typing but anyone thats been there, you know all the bad things. Its basically the same for us all, give or take one or two different issues. Every single problem I had in my life all stemmed back to one thing....getting high. Well enough is enough.

Without spiraling to deep into this rabit hole.....today marks 15 months of sobriety for me. I stopped getting my sublacade injection 7 weeks ago and haven't taken a single film since then. Back in May I closed out my 2 open cys cases, by closed I mean after two and a half years of my kids being in kinship foster care and the court pushing hard for adoption and terminationof parental rights, I managed to stop all of that from happening and all i really did was quit getting high, all the things they expected from me werent really all that much once I was sober, when I was fucked up, the piss tests, the check ins and The supervised visits all seem like complete bullshit, and not to mention completely impossible. And whats even crazier is I MAXED out my parole in June so im officially off paper after years of probation/parole up my ass violating me and locking me up. Im back working full time, took a promotion to a foremans position in April. My life today compared to a year and a half ago is like night and day difference. Most people that know me wouldn't believe this is the new me if they havent seen it themselves. Complete turnaround. I'm very fortunate to have been able to have done this as quickly as I have. Once my family realized i was serious about changing my way of life they have been the best support through all this. 15 months without a single taste of anything. I never thought it possible. I should mention I did some jail time which gave me a break from it all, and when I got out I just made the decision that I was done living that way. I just hope this new way of life sticks. Lol. I used to hear people say ""recovery is possible"" and think they were full of complete shit, I would think to myself easy for these mother fuckers to say when they couldnt survive a day in my life let alone a lifetime of it.

1mi032j,Trauma-informed care matters so much in LGBTQ+ recovery,"Having honor of supporting many LGBTQ+ clients through their recovery journeys. One thing that’s become really clear over the years: if we’re not talking about trauma, we’re missing the point.

For many of us queer and trans folks, substance use and mental health struggles aren’t random. They’re coping strategies, creative, resourceful, sometimes life-saving responses to trauma.

Trauma can look different for everyone from growing up with constant shame or fear of being “found out” to bullying, harassment, or not feeling safe in your community.

When someone finally steps into treatment or therapy, and that trauma isn’t acknowledged, or worse, is dismissed, it can feel retraumatizing all over again.

That’s why trauma-informed care for LGBTQ+ people is essential. 

Sharing this because we know how often queer people feel like recovery spaces weren’t built for them. And honestly? A lot of them weren’t. But there are places and people doing it differently, centering compassion, safety, and autonomy.

If you’re queer, trans, or nonbinary and struggling with your mental health or substance use: your story makes sense. You’re not broken. You adapted the best you could. And healing is absolutely possible.",1754369473.0,2,4,addiction,addiction

1mhxvje,1 month sober: Dreams,"Now what??

Ive been sober a month, now what do I do?? 
Many things have changed but overall my life seems more or less the same…
Some of my routines changed, my thinking patterns are a little different, the world seems brighter, I have more energy… Im not completely sold yet though &
I just dont know how long I can keep this up…
I still suffer from chronic depression from when I was 11 till now (28yo). Life just feels like a fucking chore.
From nutrition, to hygiene, to going to work, to setting goals, to taking care of my mental health… I dont necessarily care for any of it. Right now I just feel like  I have to do it, because I know what happens if I dont… I wanted my world to light up when I got sober( I knew it wasnt gonna happen) In my active addiction and now, I still feel more alone than ever & my dreams for the future have died… 

Its funny, I used to not dream at all when I was using. I really enjoyed that, or maybe my dreams were just sublime nothingness… Now most of my dreams are meaningless nightmares where I relapse or something ridiculous happens… Its never good… I fantasize about death… Ive lost so many years due to my addiction/mental illness… They’re not coming back… 

Things seem harder, & its harder to reach out… I tried therapy at one point but nothing is worse than sitting down and being told by some younger, early 20s fresh out of school who knows fuck all about the world to “think positively about 3 things a day” 
I rebuke them. I rebuke the state of this country where we elect sick criminals to become president & into office…I rebuke this economy…  
Im filled with hate… Anger… Broken dreams… I fantasize about death. It seems easier than this performance Im constantly putting on... Sick of always being in survival mode… Im sick of being stuck at the house on the weekend with no hint of any plans… It doesnt even feel like depression, this feels like a normal response tbh… 

I dont have the strong desire to use or drink alcohol yet… Todays my month mark, I did feel a strong urge to use tonight but the feeling came and went… 
Its just funny how my sobriety means very little to me. It feels like i’ve hiked everest but looking back theres still so much work to do & I don’t hear anyone clapping for me… Oh well…

So I have someone I can get methadone from but I don't wanna go to clinic again I just want to detox with it if possible. And another question.. if I am 48-72hrs into my detox, and maybe just havd a little dope just to take the worst of it off, does that essentially ""restart"" my detox ? Or if I used just a bit would that be alright. My goal here isn't to really get completely clean, but to detox from this shit so I won't wake up everyday worrying about getting sick.

Depression is through the roof, the worst it’s been in a long time, and I’m having intense cravings even though my DOC destroyed me, I was using a catheter for about 3 months due to drug-induced urine retention and just got it out a few weeks ago. It was miserable, but my cravings sometimes reach a level where I wish I could have it back just so I can still use and not have to worry about going back to the ER unable to urinate. I also sometimes crave other substances, nothing specific, literally just anything to “take the edge off.” I’m in an isolated enough position that I would have a really hard time obtaining anything illegal, so that’s pretty much what is stopping me.

My social life is pretty much non-existent. I’m going back to school soon in 3 weeks, which should make things a little bit easier. I’ve never been great socializing. Social anxiety was actually the root cause of my substance use. Until then I’m working one day a week at a family business and I barely have any friends, so I don’t get out much. 

In order to cope with these feelings I’ve just been sleeping. I have horrible insomnia, so I’ve been knocking myself out with 40mg of melatonin (I know that’s dangerous, but it’s the lowest dose that works on me right now).

1mhsxkd,Living with a partner addicted to crack/cocaine – trying to set boundaries without losing myself,"Hi,
I’m writing here anonymously because I feel really stuck, and I need advice from people who have either struggled with addiction themselves or have lived through it with someone they love.

I’m in a long-term relationship with someone who has a cocaine/crack addiction. We’ve been together for several years, and we now have a young child together. I love him, but I’ve reached a point where I can no longer live with lies, broken promises, and the emotional chaos that comes with his use. He says he wants to stop, but he refuses therapy or outside help. Every time I try to support him or suggest a plan, he says I’m “controlling” or “making threats.”

Recently, I tried to propose a very basic plan:
	•	Stop using immediately
	•	Pick an official sobriety date
	•	Clean out all his hiding spots with me
	•	Get rid of all leftover drugs or tools
	•	Share a weekly summary or photo of his   expenses to rebuild trust
	•	Be honest if he relapses, no more hiding

I told him that if he can stick to this for 30 days, we’ll reassess things together. But if he lies or hides things again, I won’t be able to continue in this relationship.

His response was full of anger. He told me to leave if I want, that I’m always changing my mind, that he’s tired of being told what to do, and that I won’t “take his child away.” It hurt. I’m not threatening to leave, I just want to feel safe and respected.

I don’t want to abandon him, and I definitely don’t want to raise our child in an environment full of tension, mistrust, and addiction. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Has anyone here successfully supported a partner through cocaine/crack addiction without therapy or rehab?
Is it even realistic to set boundaries like this, or am I setting myself up for disappointment?

1mhc5uu,Relapse isn’t the end. It’s information.,"I wish more people talked about how confusing relapse is—not just the guilt, but the shame spiral that follows.

It’s like… the moment it happens, your brain tells you: *“Well, that’s it. You’re back to square one.”* But you’re not.

You’re at **this moment**, with all the shit you’ve already been through. All the lessons you learned. You didn’t forget everything. You didn’t undo your progress. You just hit something that your coping tools weren’t ready for yet.

And that’s not failure. That’s data.

A relapse doesn’t mean you’re weak. It means your nervous system is still healing. Your patterns are still untangling. You’re still figuring out what safety and self-trust actually feel like.

So if you’re in it right now—slipped, used, ghosted your support system—it’s not over. You’re not broken. You’re just still in the middle of your story.

1mhqmp9,The First Line I Crossed,"I used to be deep in it. Years later, I’m still trying to make sense of the early choices that felt so small at the time. This is a story about the first time I became someone I didn’t recognize. It’s not a rock bottom moment. It’s what came *before*. I wanted to share.

\-S

I’ve always had a way of standing at the edge of a tornado, looking to the sky for some semblance of familiarity within myself. Like something I used to know, but that’s been lost in time. Every stretch of calm, every instance of settlement, feels like a warning. An opportunity to wind back up again. To chase the next storm.

This time was no different.

Winter was long and dreary that year. We had record snow, each street layered with dusting after dusting of white. Weeks went by. Soon, expectation left our city, and even the busiest were forced to be still. Days felt long and robust, full of impending spirit and wonder for the season. Neighbors helped neighbors. Strangers stood guard at each twist of pavement to pull people out. Each hill became a winter sports track. Each weary, lonesome road became a place of community.

My apartment was small. An unconvincing basement remodel with mismatched appliances and a weathered cloth dusty-brown couch. But I was in love. It was 500 square feet of freedom. Each meal was made from the microwave or the coffee pot. I didn’t care. The smell of my Target candles. The sound of the landlord’s smoke alarm battery warning, ringing clear and true through the air. I fell in love with every aspect of it, because it was mine. I also fell in love with the feeling of freedom, of choices, and that raw sense of excitement when you finally break free of an opposite system.

I spent that winter surrounded by friends and enemies alike, accepting our fabricated roles in each moment for the greater good. It never mattered the depth of our characters. I wasn’t looking for anything honest.

Then came Jason.

He didn’t arrive in a big way. He just started showing up, like smoke slipping through the cracks. He was a friend of a friend, a concept more than a person. Someone you heard about before you met, like a ghost with a reputation. I remember the first time he came over. I remember the buzz that followed him through the door. He lived fast. Everyone knew it. And I knew I wanted in.

I don’t know if it was the illicit drugs that followed, or the sickness in me that craves brokenness and pain. Within a day, we were together. I was a sidekick to the action, a girlfriend to a dealer, but it felt even higher. We piled everyone in the car, headed for the local spots. We had spent every weekend here, wandering from place to place, barely clothed and barely legal. That night was alive. I felt like every sense of my being was amplified, like my very personality was flowing out of me the way it had always meant to. Suddenly, each pair of eyes was an invitation. Each interaction was proof of validity.

Jason and I left together, driving away in his tinted-out Jetta into the night. We spent our time stopping at different houses. Each stop was an addition to my mental list of who Jason knew, each time leaving me wondering how in the world that meeting could have happened. Some were surprising. Some fit the bill. I spent the night being introduced to a different kind of chaos. I spent the night falling in love with a different version of something I had seen a million times before.

Part of me wishes this was the start of a redemption. That those moments hit my bones differently. That I walked away changed. But this was just a beginning. The next step in a longer and more entangled mess.

The night didn’t end with some dramatic turn. There was no moral awakening. Just a slow slide. One decision folding into the next until it became normal. Until I stopped noticing the edge I had crossed.

Part of me wishes it wasn’t the winter I became someone else. The night I assumed a role that felt prophesized.

1mhrn8r,Do I belong here?,"Hi guys, I have kind of a weird post

I’m posting because I don’t want to invade spaces that don’t belong to me, and I’m working on self improvement so here we go

I started smoking weed when I was 18.
from 19 until three months ago (22) I smoked every single day 

The last two years pretty much my life has been centered around getting high and all I want to do is smoke until I can’t see basically

During my peak I would smoke weed  and drink heavily every day

I also would do shrooms or acid or LSD once a week during my peak

Starting about three months ago I decided to take a break from smoking, and I would only have one drink a week, socially — and nothing else

Since than I’ve only smoked twice and both times it was because I thought it might be fun to do for a holiday, and both times I didn’t really get the enjoyment from it I used to 

I still miss that high often but I’m now in a place where I don’t think I have any desire to smoke, because it just doesn’t feel the same 

I do still drink on occasion but I make sure I limit to once a week and always socially, never alone! 

This all brings me to my point:
I recognize that my relationship with weed, and at times alcohol, is problematic, especially with how physically hard it was to stop smoking weed, but I still drink and don’t feel urges to go overboard

Also I know a lot of addicts who are in recovery still smoke weed because it’s not really an addictive drug, or that hardcore of a drug

So I acknowledge in the grand scheme of it all, my situation is microscopic and to many people a complete non-issue

So do I have the right to be here, and occasionally seek/give advice?

1mhl237,"Looking for some advice from people who quit cigarettes, weed and alcohol","I (27m) have been smoking weed and cigarettes daily for about 10 years and I drink almost every friday night. I've realized for quite a while now that I'm poisoning myself and I have to quit if I want to improve my life. Little side note: I live in a country where weed is illegal so it's difficult to find good quality weed and it is still frowned upon by most people. 

I often hear that the first step towards quitting is that you have to want to quit. But there's the problem, and I truly feel ridiculous saying it, but I don't want to quit. At all. 

I love weed. I do have ADD, but to put it simply: it just clears my head and emotions in a way that other types of medication for ADD haven't done for me. But at the same time, I know I'm avoiding certain emotions by surpressing them with weed. I know this because, if I don't smoke for even a day, which I only do if I have to, it feels like my frustration and anger is just driving me insane. But knowing I get to smoke when I get home makes it bearable. So my general fear is that if I don't have something to calm my nerves, I'll go insane. Again, I feel ridiculous saying it, but it's still the way I feel.

I would love nothing more than to be in a position where I could consume good quality cannabis like in a form of medicine but like I said, it is illegal and frowned upon where I live. 

It also feel weird to be smoking 2 different things and loving one but hating the other. I hate cigarettes. I hate myself everytime I do it but I still do it. I resent myself for being so dependent on something I know is really bad for my health. I'm also out of breath very quickly so I know it's already taking a toll on me. Another problem is that friday night, when I drink with my friends, the alcohol makes me crave cigarettes, and weed even more 

But I just can't imagine being at ease with myself without those things. Without having those things to turn my brain off, because if I don't, I'm scared of what will happen. Any advice? Thanks in advance. ",1754331108.0,2,5,addiction,addiction

1mhokmu,Supporting Partner With Quitting Weed,"Hello! My spouse has had an addiction to weed for the past 5 years, we've been together for 8. We've been struggling to get him to stay sober for the last 2 years. I learned this year that I have a lot of things I need to work on.

One of them being my confidence. This has always been a big issue in our relationship as I lack a lot of confidence, and therefore a backbone to say ""no"" when it comes to weed usage and just putting my foot down to step up in general. I have become an enabler and in turn am hurting my partner by avoiding conflict by saying ""yes"".

Last night I failed again in saying ""no"" to weed and ended up driving us to the dispensary. He expressed his disappointment and frustration with me because he feels like he will never quit and get back on his feet. He has CPTSD, autism, and ADHD and we've struggled a lot this year trying to get him help with a lot of these things and he has expressed feeling very alone because I haven't been more confident to take initiative to support him.

I learned I have a lot of trouble connecting with my emotions and therefore I have not been communicating needs and also not discussing plans on how we can tackle these things. It's not an excuse and I want to do better for him and our relationship.

I am currently trying to look online to see how I can gain more confidence and learn to say ""no"" better. I read an article on enablers and the reasons why they keep enabling despite knowing it's hurting their loved one. I am ready and want to change. I'm going to also bring this up with my therapist.

Does anyone have any advice for caring for someone who is going through addiction and maybe their own experiences being an enabler and wanting to stop?

How did you stop being emotionally enmeshed with your love one, and what does someone do for you that encourages you to stay sober?

1mhpjnk,"5 days without liquor, here's what's helping me so far","**First, the basics —** exercise, time in nature, cutting toxic people/situations — and creating new addiction-like goals, like ramping up to 15,000–20,000 steps daily on outdoor walks, plus a rigorous mountain climb weekly.

Beyond the natural things one must do, below is what has ACTUALLY helped me quit both **benzos/Z-drugs** and, as of **five days ago**, **heavy daily drinking** (*around half a handle of vodka per day, spaced throughout the day*).

**If you’re still heavily drinking, please stop.** It WILL catch up with you, and result in premature death (i.e., cancer) or kill you even earlier via liver failure. 

My doctor and I reviewed my **liver enzymes (AST and ALT)**, and he said: *""If you don’t stop, you’re going to die.""*

So, I’m VERY glad I’m kicking all these downers before age 40 — I don’t know if my body would’ve held up much longer (10+ years of this type of abuse). 

# Disclaimer:

This is my personal experience, **not medical advice**. Please consult a provider before trying any of this, especially during withdrawal. **Withdrawals can be deadly** — for instance, I’ve had **grand mal seizures** several times, and if it happens in the wrong place or position, it can be fatal.

# Background

I’m a former **severe polysubstance user**.

At my worst, about 5 months ago, my daily routine included at least **100mg of Ambien IR**, mixed with cheap vodka or wine, usually diluted with Gatorade Zero to stay “functional” (*ridiculous, I know*) from waking to sleep.

Even after tapering and quitting the pills about four months ago, the drinking persisted — and recently worsened due to a personal life event.

So for me, **liquor is the ""final boss.""** Quitting cold turkey **five days ago**, under ongoing PCP supervision (***no rehab this time — didn’t work for me***), has been game-changing.

# Here’s what’s helping me so far — introduced gradually & used strategically.

*Although not noted below, I was given a small number of* ***Valium*** *(enough to last 2 weeks), but I have not yet felt compelled to use it.*

# 🔹 Prescribed Interventions

**• Gabapentin**  
  
Prescribed in high doses to prevent seizures during acute withdrawal — **absolutely essential** the first few days.  
  
Now that I’m past the 3–4 day seizure window, I still take small maintenance doses (**300 mg**, about three times a day).  
  
It doesn’t do much for anxiety (**my GABA system’s fried beyond comprehension**), but it gives me peace of mind since I’ve had seizures before.

**• Adderall IR**  
  
Once entirely off benzos/Z-drugs, Adderall helped restore **executive function**, **focus**, and **impulse control**.  
Started only after full detox and **under medical supervision**.  
This has been one of the most **crucial pieces** of recovery: Adderall has nearly **eliminated my daytime liquor cravings**.

**• Seroquel (quetiapine, 150 mg IR – prescribed nightly, one hour before bed)**  
  
Arguably another essential piece these past five days — it **100% lets me sleep**.  
  
For me, a lifelong insomniac, **lack of sleep is the hardest part** of pill/alcohol withdrawal, especially with **GABA/glutamate imbalance**.  
  
Since quitting pills about 4 months ago, I now take it nightly as prescribed. Without it, I **HIGHLY** doubt I’d be as stable right now.

# 🔹 Neuroprotective / Nootropic Agents

**• Mexidol (Emoxypine Succinate)**  
  
A Russian-developed antioxidant that modulates **GABA and glutamate**. Helps **regulate mood** and reduce **cognitive fog** during early recovery.  
  
Some call it a “**mini-benzo**” due to its subtle anti-anxiety effects.

Subtle, seems to be help my withdrawals - welcome insight on how it has helped others.

**• Agmatine Sulfate**  
  
Acts on **NMDA and imidazoline receptors**. Shows promise for reducing cravings and supporting **neuroplasticity**.  
  
For me, so far, it seems to level out things out without sedation.  
  
Common in Reddit recovery posts, and while the research is early, it **does something helpful** for me.

**• Picamilon (GABA + niacin)**  
  
Fast-acting for **craving spikes**.   
  
Notably, it crosses the blood–brain barrier and delivers **GABAergic relief** without benzo dependency.  
  
Over the past five days, I’ve used this **sparingly**, only when the **old loop starts kicking in**.  
  
*Note:* It is **not FDA-approved** in the U.S.

# 🔹 Herbal / Natural Supports

**• Lemon Balm Extract**  
  
Gentle, non-sedating anxiety relief. Not advertising, but I use **Double Wood’s liquid extract** 1–2x daily to ease tension without sedation.  
  
There are dozens of herbal options — just don’t blow cash chasing hype. **I recommend tracking what helps.**

Also, **Passionflower and Valerian Root extracts have** helped in **anxiety emergencies**.

# Closing

None of this is a **cure-all**, but this stack has — so far — stabilized me enough to **reclaim agency**.

Before today, I wasn’t in a position to go outside, speak to anyone, or even post on Reddit much.  But I feel my old self coming out of its shell.

Yes, I know five days is early, but I’ve already beaten the pills (**Ambien = ""Devil's Aspirin""**) — and I’m feeling good, so far, about saying goodbye to liquor, too.

In just five days, my **Garmin watch shows major sleep improvements**, my **energy is returning**, and my **mental clarity is noticeably better**.

**Substance abuse hell does NOT have to be permanent.**

1mgvbrx,Fucked up by finding old pills in my parents house.,"I was at my parents house, sort of wandering the halls (nostalgic I guess). I’ve been moved out of their place for about a year now and have just been getting hit hard with those mid-life crisis feelings. 

I was taking a look through the bathroom that used to be mine, ya know- snooping. It was never great when I lived with my parents but they’re still physically around at least. 

Anyway I opened up a cabinet and saw a few prescription bottles. Well naturally I read the labels and found it was a bunch of older oxys and hydrocodone. Both were full and were prescriptions in my name. Based on the doctor names it was prescribed when I had surgery, but I never took them. 

I stared at them for a few minutes, but ultimately closed the cabinet and forced myself out of the bathroom. 

I never had an issue with pills. Mostly because I had no way to get them and didn’t really try.

However- now that I know what’s there and where they are, I keep thinking about them. I keep thinking about how they’re technically mine, maybe it’ll actually help my physical pain. Then the logical part kicks back in and reminds me that this is just my addictive personality. But as the day went on and since then- it’s just locked in my mind that they’re there.

I couldn’t do t breaks and I was going through a 2g cart and a 3.5 in 2 days, I would hit my cart as I was in the shower. Eventually I stopped for 2 days and the next time I hit my cart I had horrible anxiety attack that caused depersonalization for months, it was the only thing that stopped me, when I realized I couldn’t smoke I considered moving to pills but couldn’t get my hands on any, I tried smoking again but the panic attacks would happen, so I got blackout drunk whenever I could which wasn’t often, I never drank before that but the very first time and every time after that I got so drunk I would wake up at home and not know how I got there. When I was smoking my mom would give up on trying to get me stop because there was no point, I’d always find a way. My friends also smoked but they would make jokes or say things that pointed out that I didn’t smoke like them or other people who smoked, they made it sound like I had a problem which confused me because its just weed and we were all smoking it?

Mi proceso para dejar la droga

No fue fácil, pero lo logré. Consumí cocaína casi a diario durante dos meses. En ese momento no me daba cuenta de cómo me estaba apagando por dentro. Al principio parecía que me daba energía, que me animaba… pero con el tiempo empecé a sentirme vacío, sin placer por nada, ni siquiera por cosas que antes disfrutaba. No sentía alegría, no sentía emociones, solo un vacío constante.

Tomar la decisión de dejarla fue difícil. Al principio, me sentía peor: ansiedad, desesperación, aburrimiento, apatía total. Pero sabía que si seguía por ese camino, iba a terminar muy mal. Así que aguanté. Pasaron semanas, luego meses… y poco a poco empecé a volver a sentir. Hoy, después de cuatro meses limpio, puedo decir que la vida empieza a tener sentido otra vez.

Ya disfruto cosas simples como una conversación, la música, hasta el placer físico. No al 100% todavía, pero cada día es mejor.

Si tú estás pasando por lo mismo, solo quiero decirte que sí se puede. No va a ser fácil, pero tampoco imposible. La clave es no rendirse. Nunca es demasiado tarde para cambiar, solo debes convencerte de que puedes hacerlo. Ese camino oscuro no es vida. Tú decides cuándo cambiar.",1754269796.0,2,1,addiction,addiction

1mgn3n2,Addiction Is Not The Problem,"Most people who struggle with addiction face the same four battles:

•The inability to control thought

•The inability to fight temptation long-term

•The inability to self-soothe in a healthy way

•The inability to identify the root of the addiction


I’m Dai, and I recovered from a lifelong battle with lust, sex, and porn addiction.

I lived a pretty rebellious life in the streets as a teen. On my way to total self-destruction, God interrupted me — offered me a new path, and honestly… it was an offer I couldn’t refuse. So I followed.

Fast forward — I cut ties with everything toxic. Friends. Habits (smoking, drinking, etc.)

But somehow, that one addiction — lust, sex, porn — it just wouldn’t let me go.
Or maybe, I wouldn’t let it go.

I had seasons of freedom, but I’d always relapse. And each time I came back to it, I fell deeper than before.

That gut-wrenching feeling of knowing better — not just spiritually but scientifically — yet still giving in? It’s torment.

You feel worthless. Like a legit demon in human skin 😂.

Yeah… I’ve been through it all. You’re not alone.



Here’s what I wish someone would’ve told me:

Addiction is not the root. It’s the symptom.

At some level (it’s a spectrum), you’re traumatized.
And not only that — you have a unique spiritual wiring that makes you more prone to certain patterns than others.

Your nervous system, your subconscious — they’ve been storing trauma from childhood to now.
If you don’t address what’s been stored, your body will automatically search for a way to cope.

And somewhere (most likely before 18), you stumbled upon sex/porn, and your nervous system mistook it as the healing it was starving for.

It wasn’t. It was an artificial version of what God designed to be sacred and holy.



So what’s the solution?

You heal the addiction by healing the inner child you left behind.

First, acknowledge them.
Apologize on behalf of the adults who failed them.
Ask them what they truly needed. Listen.
Then give it to them — for real this time.

You’d never hand a child porn. So why keep doing it to your own inner child?

Most of the time, they’re just asking for the basics:

	•	Words of love (I love you. I’m sorry. You’re safe. You’re loved. God loves you and is with you. Etc.)

	•	Comfort (a hot bath, nutritious food, sunlight, a hug — even from yourself)
Not genital stimulation.

Heal the child. Rewire the nervous system. Break the cycle.



Then comes mindfulness.

Mindfulness = separation between thought and soul.

To be present is to realize: you’ve been asleep your whole life.
Even right now — reading this — you think you’re awake. But you’re running on subconscious programs.
Habits. Loops. Patterns.
(YouTube Dr. Bruce Lipton if you want the science.)

So your identity hasn’t learned how to separate from your thoughts.
And that’s why they control you.

Here’s the key:

Your thoughts are clouds. 
You are NOT the clouds.

Lustful thought pops in? Cool. Let it pass. Don’t resist. Don’t shame yourself.
Observe it. Label it. Watch it float by.
The next one will come. Let that pass too.

The moment you stop fighting your thoughts, and start watching them — you win.
You rise above the cycle.



Now here’s the final unlock:

You are not your urges.
You are not your thoughts.
You are not your trauma.
You are the sky.

The weather — your emotions, urges, situations — is always changing.
But the sky? Always there. Still. Whole. Unchanging.

You ever fly in a plane and watch it rise above the clouds?
It’s dark and gloomy down below, but above it? Clear blue.

That’s you.

Your environment changes. Your body changes. But your soul — the part of you made in the image of God — remains pure.
It’s not broken. It’s not addicted.
It’s just buried.

So if you’re still in the fight — breathing, bleeding, trying — know this:

You’re not broken.
You’re not hopeless.
You’re not addicted at the core.
You’re simply unhealed… but healing is possible.

You are not your past.
You are not your patterns.
You are not your pain.

You are the sky — steady, unchanging, created by God to reflect His perfection, not your mistakes.

This journey isn’t about becoming something new. It’s about returning to who you were before the world wounded you.

And from that place — [clear, calm, conscious]
the thoughts will pass,
the cravings will quiet,
and the storm will no longer shake you.

Because when you finally remember who you are, no chain can hold you.

Stay the course.
Fight with wisdom.
Heal with compassion.
And rise — like the sky — beyond it all.",1754237343.0,5,8,addiction,addiction

However, a few days ago I was at her small place. She got something from behind the kitchen bar and headed to the restroom right next to it.

She of course gave up on trying to hide it, and she smoked a couple of hits of something - crack or meth, I would assume.

The night ended on a positive note (we hung out for just over 12 hours, with me leaving her place at 5:30 in the morning - we're just friends, no sex).

She's put in so much hard work to get clean, and it makes me sad thinking she's going to slide back into serious addiction. Maybe she can handle it, maybe it was a one-time thing, I don't know.

So I'm coming here for two pieces of advice. First, what can I do or say (or not do or say) to help her? And second, what can I do to protect myself emotionally?

1mgoj88,My mother is addicted to meth and has been hiding it from me for 5 years,"As the title says my mother has been a meth addict for 5 years. It’s a very long and crazy story but I’ll try and shorten it a bit. Around 2020 my dad got a house and my mom and I moved in and lived with him. My mom and my dad always had a very strained relationship together but I think them living together kind of fixed things. All was well until my aunt and uncle started camping on our property (we live on an acreage so there’s plenty of land for them to do so) they had our permission and we were fine with it. Eventually one night out of the blue I overheard my mom freaking out at my uncle and the next morning my aunt and uncle were no longer camping at our place. I eventually found out my uncle admitted he was addicted to meth and he was seeking help for his addiction. He told my dad and my aunt that he had been doing meth with my mom for quite some time. My mom denied this verrry hard and said he was crazy. She pushed heavily into my head that my aunt and uncle were people that I could not trust and they were liars. I’ve always seen my mom as hardworking and truthful so I took her side. I didn’t believe the story at all. Fast forward 5 years later. I’m now 18 and I went to a “graduation party” that my uncle and aunt hosted for me. It was just some immediate family and some friends and we all camped at a campground for the night. Eventually they started drinking and they also decided to let me drink as well. We got to the topic of my mom addiction and the stuff they were saying about her blew my mind. I had completely forgotten about the fact that my mother was a supposed addict because she had told me over and over that it wasn’t true whatsoever. Eventually after that night I went home and out of curiosity I went on my mom’s Facebook messenger. I saw texts between her and some guy talking about meeting up and buying “minnows” (pretty sure code word for some sort of drug since she does not fish whatsoever). My aunt and uncle also told me about the guy she was messaging and said he was a well known drug dealer in our area and not only that he also had a thing for my mom (so there’s a chance she could be cheating on my dad??). 

I apologize this is a long story and it’s probably pretty jumbled together but I need to get this off my chest.

Well she got out and on house arrest for 1 year on Monday. Her communication is off, she doesn't do anything she's talked about. She shows real addict behavior. Isolating herself, very distant.

He works two jobs, enrolled some online courses, manages friendship and overally keeps it tight. But he's not mentally stable and never was. Undiagnosed, suspect schizophrenia and depression. Multiple suicide attempts. 

So ofc his life is hard and he wants to relax and judged on his previous state hes now better than before. But when he's stoned im scared, uncomfortable and repulsed. 

He doesn't like that. He doesn’t like when i try to hold him accountable. He's getting all sad that I'm ""judging his recovery ways"". I feel like i have one more deadbeat father sometimes.

1mghd1q,How do you force end addictions,"I’m not sure if this subreddit is only for drug/alcohol addiction. If it is please remove my post. I have ADHD and have addictions/implsuivity things in most areas of life spending, binge eatting, etc. 

Not sure if the title made sense. I have ADHD and REALLY struggle with impulsive control and what I would call addictions (I don’t do drugs, alcohol, cigarettes but more life things).

Basically I have really bad addictions and impulsive control with everyday things. And the only way to stop it I have tried everything is to physically find a way to stop it. Like with money I will just spend all my money and made me homeless for long time. But now I use a locked bank account so as soon as I get money I quickly buy all things I will need till next pay then lock all the rest in a locked account.


And the other thing is biting nails I really cannot stop I have just bought a no bite nail polish thing to force me to stop and is already working.

And those the are 2 things so far. The moment thing completed fixed my money problem but I have done that for a year and has been great.

I struggle with binge eating REALLY bad too. I am planning to buy a. Fridge lock with timer soon. And also phone addiction I use it every waking hour I plan to buy a phone box and timer.

Thar is all my plans so far to control my money, phone, nail biting, eating).

I do have little periods of self control like I can control myself enough to send all the money to locked account or to use fridge lock grab onlt food needed out then lock again for however mant hours.

But it’s when things are not locked away I have 0 self control. And irs so and will literally spend all my money and become homeless. And eatting so bad have gained over 20KG in only few months. 

And this is my whole life so bad no self control. I am wondering if anyone has any things they do to force control their implsuivity. I wish I had a way to force control myself in a way to make myself do fitness things and other things. ",1754222008.0,1,2,addiction,addiction
1mgdnwi,I’m so ashamed of letting myself become addicted,"I recently reached the conclusion that I have some sort of problem with stimulant adhd medication. I’m not sure if it’s a true chemical addiction but it’s definitely not right. And I’m so ashamed. I always swore I would never become an addict. It runs in my family and I saw people die of it and swore I’d never let it happen to me. And I was so good about that. The moment I started feeling urges to drink during the day I quit. I stopped and stayed stopped aside from two one drink slip ups. I didn’t let it become a problem. I got off the train before it left the station. I don’t gamble. I only occasionally smoke weed but plan to quit when I finish my supply because I just don’t want it to be part of my life anymore. But in terms of adhd meds it was such a blind spot for me. I started taking them when I was about fourteen maybe fifteen. My mom would give me my older sister’s pills on occasion to help with school. Eventually I got my own prescription. I took it daily for awhile but the crash at the end of the day was so miserable that I found myself trying to figure out if I could get a second smaller dose to microdose later in the day to ease the comedown. I thought I’d get in trouble with my doctor if I asked for it though so I stopped taking it. I started taking it again for a big school project that I needed to pull an all nighter for. And so began a bad habit. I would be off to 90% of the time, but every couple of months I would take as many as I needed to get shit done. It was a great system. When I would run out or not have any my mom would give me my father’s prescription to take instead, and so I would also steal my older siblings expired pills so I could take more in secret at night to stay up later. It never occurred to me that any of this could be problematic at all. It was so normal to me. It wasn’t until I had to go to an AA and NA meeting for one of my nursing classes that I realized there might be a problem. I’m so embarassed and ashamed that I let myself develop this problem. When my older sister went to rehab for illegal drugs I was so furious at her because I couldn’t comprehend how she could have been so reckless and would’ve ever put herself in that position in the first place. But now im just ashamed of myself. I feel so stupid. I don’t want to be an addict. I don’t want it at all. I feel like I’m contaminated and stupid. That wasn’t supposed to be my life story. I’m so defeated over it. Nobody in my life knows. I definitely did some messed up stuff while tweaking in high school but I had a lot of mental health issues so honestly at a certain point my sober actions were just as bad if not worse than my tweaking ones. Even then though, I did well in school and still do and have a really good relationship with my family now and we’ve moved on from all of that misery. God I just feel like the worst person in the world and like it’s all my miserable fault that I’ve saddled myself with this struggle. ",1754207880.0,2,3,addiction,addiction
1mggw6c,"Right place to post? There is no rehab for me, is there?","1. I was not on any medications and had over 3 years clean and sober.

2. I got mono (Epstein Barr) and within 3 weeks I woke up one day to my alarm going off maybe a minute after I closed my eyes. But it was morning? That couldn’t be, I hadn’t had any sleep. How did 9 hours pass? 

3. That was 18 years ago and I have not had the experience of refreshing sleep since, except for in dribs and drabs for the first couple years.

4. I eventually lost my job and then 7 others. Before that, I had worked 10 years pretty much straight and had never been fired before. One of those 7 jobs, I walked to the car with my keys and coffee in hands, put my key in the door, took it out, turned back around into the house, called my immediate supervisor who I had no issue with (by this point I was doing the simplest job ever: working for a woman’s clothing company scanning competitor’s ads from newspapers and putting them in a power point. I was a college grad and had done a million power points before. And had the same printer/scanner at home. Yet I could not figure out how to do my job.) and cursed her out, getting very personal, on her voicemail, for no reason. I calmly went upstairs and slept for 5 days. 

5. This was normal, sleeping for 5 days. Be up 8 hours, sometimes twice that, sleep for 5 days. I would describe the feeling as a Chinese food nap x1000. I would vomit when i woke up. 

6. No one in my family thought anything was medically wrong. I lost my immediate family, who I was very close to my whole life as well as all my friends including my best friend of 15 years and a group of girls I had been close with since 7th grade. I had 1 friend but he lived. 2,000 mi away. I had nowhere to live except to move in with my mom, who I had estranged myself from 7 years earlier when I was 19. She believed and so did anyone who lived with me for any amount of time except my dad. 

7. It took me 8 years to get a diagnosis of Kleine Levin Syndrome. 

8. KLS usually lats for 10-12 years on average and when I went into remission at the 10 years point (although I was still tired all the time but i could deal with that) I thought I was cured. After having spent approx. 6 years at that point speaking maybe 20 min a week and leaving the house once every 6 weeks to go to the doctor and maybe 4-5 more times a year to be judged by my family, I started driving to the shore every week to stay in my dad’s abandoned house, dating, working, writing a book, going to concerts, living my life. 

9. After 10 months the symptoms started up again. I was beyond desperate. I made a stupid mistake and turned to a stimulant to try to keep them at bay. 8 years later, I am still addicted to that stimulant along with medications I am prescribed that are narcotic and antidepressants that I want off of. Sone are dangerous to detox from. 

10. I have been ignoring serious health issues for some time including autoimmune diseases I have developed, edema in my legs and feet, melasma, pre-skin cancer, a rectocele, etc. mostly because I have no one to help me. I will make a dr appointment, it will be 3 or 4 months away at best, and I will sleep through it unless I have someone to physically move me there and know enough to no be offended by how i may act at the time because i have no control or memory of it. I need them to advocate to doctors for me and take notes and explain. 

11. I don’t know what is illness, medications, circumstances, mental illness but I would like a drug free baseline and have wanted one for many years.

12. There are a ton of rehabs for people with mental health issues. There are a ton of rehabs for detoxing from opiates when you have chronic pain. There is not one rehab i can find that will take and can help me. Not one place that can help me see the doctors I need to. To help me detox off these meds. Not one place that is okay with the reality that I may sleep for days at a time and need someone to wake me for meds and that if i am for ed awake to go through a 7am to 9pm (or whatever) daily schedule, I will not be the same person i am when I am actually awake and I will slowly deteriorate in mind and body as sleep tests show I have approx 5min of rem and 45 min of stage 3/4 sleep in the first 8 hours of sleep. 

13. Don’t tell me “we can accommodate you” because you want more heads in beds. Tell me about a place made for people with chronic illnesses or medical conditions to get off of drugs and work on their issues like a normal rehab (group, cbt, whatever). 

14. If you have money to invest, I suggest you open a place like this because there are hundreds of thousands of us. And we need help. ",1754220382.0,1,3,addiction,addiction

1mfrlrh,Husband called me a junkie,"Husband and I had an argument last night and out of nowhere he called me a junkie. I was floored. Told him to get the F out.

I am an addict. Dentist started it all. Had no clue what an opiate was. Had an extraction and was prescribed an opiate. It hurt for months. I went for recheck, all was fine, more pills. I finally went to a different dentist, pain gone in 10 seconds, tiny clove packet. I had been on those pills for 3-4 months by then. I didn’t know I was addicted until WD hit. I started buying them off the streets. I started taking orally and ended up snorting them. Never used  needle. I’m scared of needles. As a kid they had to hold me down for vaccinations. As an adult, still hate them but no more holding me down, but only needles in my body , except by a medical professional. 

I got on subs. Been off them for 6 years, clean for a total  of 10+ years (not quite 11 years yet) 

I haven’t spoken to him yet. Why would he say that?? That’s low imo. The argument was about me being sad. It was the second anniversary of my brother being killed, a driver hit him and killed him in 2023, he was on a bicycle. Husband hated my brother. I had issues with him too but once he died, what’s the point??? The anger is useless, he’s gone. 

No it didn’t trigger me to relapse, what he said. I’ve lost my mom, brother and a sister in the last 5 years  and stayed clean. But I can’t be sad??? I went to work, my usual day, just sad towards the end of day (he was hit around 8 pm) and that’s when I got a bit weepy. 

Been together for 27 years, married for  20 years and never said anything like this.  I’m thinking of divorce bc in my eyes, that’s how he sees me.  

Yet he’s the fkn felon!!! He had one DUI that turned into a felony bc he kept driving (he lived in a town of 800 ppl, work was only available in town., 30 mins away. No uber  back then and taxis wouldn’t go that far ). He had to work, his dad died when he was 16 yo from a major heart attack. He took care of his mom. He never was drunk again while driving but got caught with no license and driving at least 4 times. 
I don’t hang that over his head. My addiction never landed me in jail, except my own self induced prison. 

Any advice??  I can’t look at him or talk to him, not right now. Thinking about going to a friend’s house for a bit. He left last night but I know he will come back today and act like nothing happened. I can’t do that. I am an addict, I know that. But a junkie??? Is that really what I am???

1mg5bjw,I‘ve been sober for some time now but I still don’t feel satisfied. Is this all that life is now? Idk if I can keep this up..," 
  The other day I asked a friend of mine how things were and she said- Now that I'm sober, I'm in a better place for sure. I’m focusing on my health and healing, but I know for certain the work isn’t done yet because I think about how much I miss getting fucked up every single day. I don’t understand why I never feel satisfied… Why do I feel so.. I don’t know.. fickle about life? Is this all that life is now? I don’t know if I can keep this up..

-Answering this question turned out to be the key to answering every other question I’ve ever had in my life. I’m a drug addict, and like most drug addicts, I’ve wasted more time than I care to admit on more drugs and drink than I have time to list in an attempt to escape more childhood trauma than most can fathom. Resolving the issues of abandonment, loss, rage, and the endless cycle of addiction that generational trauma is famous for may well be the hardest thing a human can do. It takes so much power of will to make it through those first painful few days, weeks, and sometimes even months. But the problem is that once the worst of it is over, well.. now what? My whole life up until this point has been a series of minute to minute dopamine rushes to achieve what I thought was happiness. Now that I don't have the only thing that l’ve associated with being happy, what can I possibly do to replace it?

  Tell me if this sounds familiar. I spent years and years and years going through a repetitive cycle of getting fucked off on drugs & alcohol, hitting rock bottom, getting sober, struggling to return my life to some semblance of normalcy- car, house, job, girlfriend, money, etc- and then coast.. until eventually, I inevitably would become bored and self-sabotage. This would quickly lead to a death spiral and subsequent crash landing back down at rock bottom, a struggle back up, rinse and repeat, over and over. 

  Alright universe, I got clean like I was supposed to. Why don’t I feel good about it? This isn't working out for me and to be honest, I’m having a really hard time remembering why I got sober in the first place. Why shouldn’t I drown my sorrows with a bottle of whiskey? Why not snort a bit of confidence from an 8-ball of cocaine? So what if I have to work tomorrow? No chance I’m going to forget to put some meth in my coffee in the morning. And at the end of this long ass day, is there any quicker relief to my anxiety than a couple Xanax? Tell me Universe, what the hell do you have to offer me that can come even REMOTELY close to how warm and safe I felt the first time I smoked fentanyl? You going to move me back into my mother’s womb?? What the FUCK am I missing??!

  To be honest, I really don't know how I made it out of all of that alive.. but I did. It took me a very long time to realize that putting yourself through the intense period of suffering required to quit drinking or kick dope.. is the easy part. Staying the course when it’s no longer physically miserable is infinitely harder, because this time, there is no huge dopamine rush to be received as a reward when you make it through the withdrawals. Sooner or later, staying clean just starts to feel like work.. a grind that’s never going to end that leaves you feeling every single day like something is.. missing. When you get to this fork in the path, you're left with three options:

Option A- Go back into the meat grinder of drugs, alcoholism, and bullshit and repeat the cycle. Chase the dragon of beating your addictions over and over and over again.

Option B- Hunker down and accept this new grey version of the world where you are unsatisfied, or “fickle”, about life.

Or option C- Find something harder and more meaningful to do than conquering the mountains of addiction were. 

  This is called “Finding your purpose.” Think about every significant life experience that led you to this exact moment in time. Now, accept that there is absolutely not a God damn thing you can do to change a book that's already been written in blood, sweat, and tears. The most basic truth in this reality, the path to achieving what you once thought was impossible, and if you’re lucky like I was the key to enlightenment, is fully realizing that YOU are and always have been the ONLY person who has any say in which direction YOUR story goes. It isn’t you versus the world.. it’s you versus YOU. Stop making excuses, stop lying to yourself, and stop telling yourself you CAN’T do *-insert literally anything-*.

  Once this incredibly simple concept TRULY sets in, no substance, no abuser, no amount of bullshit life throws your way can stop YOU. Nothing is off the table and the only qualifier for what you have the ability to accomplish is how much time you have to do it. What this means is you CAN do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING you set your mind to, or you can DIE TRYING. If you still have breath in your lungs, you can still try. No one can possibly say for sure that you won’t be the first person to live forever and if you refuse to accept that death is certain, what can you not achieve in an eternity? And if you do die, who’s going to be there to tell you that you failed? The world is a crazy place. There really are no rules or restrictions. Use your free will and the time you’ve been given wisely.

1mg4htl,How can I help my brother?,"Me and my brother are both 19 yo. we have been quite distant most of our lives but now that I moved back home I’ve become to realise he needs serious help

He started drinking and smoking weed at around 12 years old due to the influence of his friends, and even though I have been worried I didnt think it was that big of a deal (and I couldn’t really do anything about it anyways)
I am now learning that while mostly staying on alcohol and weed, he has tried and at least occasionally uses many other substances (opioids, laughing gas etc. nothing seriously “hardcore?” to my understanding) I am not sure how “occasional” this use actually is. I can clearly often see that he is on something and have gone through some serious scares like spending 20 minutes trying to wake him up by shaking him or throwing water at him with no response.

my parents are almost never home, they stay at our cottage a short drive away. They know about him drinking a lot and recently found out about him smoking. They just think he’s a stupid teenager and try to solve the situation by scolding him and turning a blind eye. I know that my brother is not mentally well. While he is not suicidal, he does wish to die and does not care about any risk his behaviour may pose to him. He sees himself and his life to be worthless and he has gone through many deaths of his friends etc. we are not close, so my attempts to convince him that he has value and should get help do not fully reach him. He has at times told me that he wants to get help, and I’ve offered to help him on that journey, but that desire always seems to fade away and get replaced by another cycle of continuous substance abuse.

He has good days. I’ve seen him have good days. But despite me and our parents he is currently pretty alone. his main friendgroup has for no obvious reason ditched him, which has driven him even deeper. I don’t know what to do. I am constantly trying to decide wether I should tell my parents about my concern, but if they decide to react the same way they always do, it will be no help and I will lose the trust of my brother, leaving me even more helpless. 

I am seriously worried. I don’t know what to do but I feel a sense that I will lose him if I dont act soon. If anyone has any advice it would be so appreciated. ",1754177476.0,3,2,addiction,addiction
1mg0z68,It’s time I stop torturing myself,"This withdrawl has been a long process of hell and rebirth for me. I sat there on my 3rd day after my RLS had calmed down slightly, and just thought to myself “wow Jack, look what you have done to yourself.” Your hair is falling out, you’re pale as a ghost, your face feels like sandpaper, and you smell like a biohazard. You’re 21 and you can’t even walk 1 block anymore, and thank god you can’t see the damage to your brain. That’s when I thought to myself, when am I going to stop torturing myself? Am I going to go my whole life in this prison of my own invention? If the world ended tomorrow, would I die satisfied? No, I wouldn’t. If I died tomorrow, my soul would continue to pity itself for entirety. I would lay in my deathbed thinking of all the terrible things that happened to me, and what could have been different if I only decided to try. And by the 9th day (today) while the depression has been ravaging my mind, It finally hit me. I REFUSE to become an overdose statistic. I REFUSE to be the dead brother, or the dead friend, or the dead son. And I REFUSE, to continue torturing myself in everyone’s display. I’m tired of this pitiful existence that I’ve convinced myself is my only option. Even if I die tomorrow, I want to die knowing that I gave it everything I had to forge a better life. I can’t promise eternal sobriety, or even that I won’t relapse tomorrow. However, I CAN promise myself that I will spend my remaining time and energy trying to live a life, and not survive a prison sentence. Even if that life is even more painful than the one before it, I don’t care anymore. It’s time I start feeling my pain, rather than hurting myself more to escape it. That’s what I chose to go cold turkey and not take my subs, cuz it was time that I finally start feeling again. 


I’m praying to every higher power that everyone else in my position or worse can escape this. But unfortunately I can’t help anyone until I help myself. And that’s exactly  I plan on doing.

1mfmq2a,How can you get your parent to give up alcohol?,"My dad is alcoholic, he has been this way since I was a little kid. He mostly drinks beer, however it's usually 3-7 cans every other day. He has alcoholism symptoms, his stomach, liver and kidneys hurt. When hangover, he complains about back pain and lays in bed all day long. It's worse since he doesn't drink normal water, only beer, milk and sparkling water, making him have diarrhea. 

Physical symptoms aside, his problem affect me and my mom heavily. My parents argue almost daily because of my dad's alcoholism. Whether it's about money, since he spends 100$ on his addiction weekly, or for something stupid he does while drunk. They scream at each other due to anything. Yesterday they fought 'cause my dad lost his shirt. I'm surprised how they're not divorced yet. For me it's seeing my own dad ruin his life. He usually gets angry at me, because my room is messy or I didn't say good morning to him. Stupid stuff like that. One time when I was 6, he got really drunk and couldn't find his toolbox. He blamed me for it and almost spanked me with his belt, that time is when I became scared of him. 

When I, myself, was struggling with alcoholism, at age 15, I only did it for 4 months, since it started to get horrible. I couldn't focus in school, the hangovers were terrible, I smelled bad, would sometimes sleep in my own puke, and so on. I'm shocked how he can keep doing it after all these years. I think that he'll drink until it takes him out. 

When I told him he has a problem a few years ago, he started to chase me around the house with the belt. Honestly, I don't think he cares about it. I personally don't bother with him that much, he's a shitty, neglectful, abusive father, and I plan to never visit him after moving out. But, I feel bad about it, he's my dad after all. I want to be at least at his funeral. 

So the question is, how do I get my dad to stop drinking, or at least not get drunk so often? I read some articles saying that I should just talk to him, but he's deep in denial, he'll fight anyone who tries to intervene. I tried hiding his alcohol, but he only buys more. To be honest, the answer is clear, leave him and let him suffer in his own misery since he doesn't want help. But if do that I'll feel bad for my mom since she'll have to keep up with his BS. There are some rehab centers in my country, but they're really expensive, and my dad won't go there on his own. ",1754128374.0,8,15,addiction,addiction

1mf33r3,My mom has given up in a way I’ve never seen,"I am 27, my mom is 56. She’s been an addict as long as I can remember, decades. Heroin mostly and uppers thrown in. She has been dealing with sepsis and kidney failure this past year. She’s been trying to kick it but you can see that she’s losing the battle. She’s less than 100 pounds. 

My entire life she lied about her usage. She tried to be a good mom, tried to shelter me from her addiction. So that meant lots of disappearing for days to weeks on end when she went on a bender. Making up fake illnesses, convinced me she had narcolepsy and that’s what nodding out was. Endless screaming and begging from me. 

In my teenage years I was so, so angry at her for not quitting. I was full of rage constantly. Age 17 I got arrested for getting into a fight with her drug dealer. 10 years later is a lifetime of change but not with her; she has never stopped lying and hiding. She has never given up in the ways I am witnessing now.

The last few conversations we’ve had, I’ve had to make it clear to her. I’m not angry, I don’t want her to quit anymore. She has treated me like the 8 year old she is too ashamed to face up until now. Im a grown woman, I understand she is on drugs, and it is silly to pretend at this point.

She used to hide her paraphernalia religiously. I’d search the house for it up and down and find nothing. She hid needles in old coat pockets in storage and drugs in fake sockets in the wall. Now, it’s spread around her room. She’s too weak to hide it. 

I saw her for the first time in a year last night. She just got out of the hospital for the kidney failure. She looks like a frail cancer patient. She doesn’t talk much or show much emotion, she’s like a zombie. 

I asked her if she detoxed in the hospital. She was honest with me, told me yes. Discussed some details of the addiction struggle with me. It is hard to explain this feels like an accomplishment I have been chasing my whole life, honesty from my mother.

But at any other point in my life, I would have been too upset and angry with her to talk like this. Combative over her choices. My mom is so ashamed to be who she is, she can’t handle those conversations. 

I just listened and talked last night. It is very bittersweet for me, hard to reconcile with. That this is all I’ve ever wanted, but neither of us could have ever had this until this point. Until we both gave up. 

As other people became involved, tried to talk to her, it was with the same anger I used to hold. I started to feel protective. I didn’t want anyone to make my weak, sweet mother feel anymore shame, even though I spent the last 10 years of my life spitting the most hateful and angry things at her. Can’t they see she doesn’t have much time left? Why spend it being angry. It is other family members who havent see it in the depths I have, this is new to them. They’re angry, they think the anger can stop this path, can heal her. They just seemed childish to me. I told them I don’t care about the drugs, stop talking about it. I just want her to feel ok. 

I think my dad gave up too. I inherited every piece of anger from him. He was violent, destructive, rageful. He tried to use his rage make her quit for 15 years. He spoke softly to her last night, unlike everyone else. I’ve never seen it. 

I held her last night. I’m so happy. We never touched growing up. I can’t ever remember hugging my mom growing up. Physical affection was entirely alien to me until recently. I never saw her sing. I’m going to try to visit her every other weekend for now on. Maybe before she goes I can sing a song with her. ",1754070276.0,93,17,addiction,addiction

1mfikmo,My anxiety is taking over my life,"I am dealing with a lot of anxiety due to my drug use and the way I act on drugs. My anxiety is getting so bad to the point where it’s debilitating and I don’t know how to function in everyday life.

My partner lives in a house with their friends. I hang out there a lot and we all like to get fucked up, but I think I tend to get too fucked up more times than not. I also have a coke problem. They all causally do coke here and there, but I’d say whenever I have coke I always overdo it and drink a TON, and become kind of insane, for lack of a better word. 

I have so many intrusive thoughts everyday, it especially has to do with the fact that I can’t remember a lot. I know that I was talking everyone’s head off while I was high, yet I can barely remember anything I said. I’m extremely paranoid that I made someone uncomfortable, or said something I shouldn’t, and my mind loops on these thoughts all day everyday. 

I have been doing coke while binge drinking for a while now on occasion, and I know that it gets to a certain point where you just become completely unhinged from yourself and say things that aren’t even true and come from absolutely nowhere. 

I’m just so so afraid that I made someone uncomfortable, hurt someone’s feelings, said something offensive, or overstepped a boundary and that’s something I would absolutely never want to do. I’m also worried about how that would affect my relationship if I did something like that. I feel like i can sense that my partner’s friends don’t really like me anymore, but at the same time I can’t tell if I’m just overthinking it or not. I’m just so worried about how that would affect my relationship. Or if I did something awful on drugs that i don’t even remember, and it will eventually come out and my partner wouldn’t be able to forgive me. My partner has also outright told me on multiple occasions that something I did while I was high hurt their feelings or made them upset, and most of the time it was something I didn’t even remember, and I feel so much guilt.

I really want to get a hold of my drug use, for myself and for everyone around me. But it’s kind of like a loop, this anxiety and paranoia consumes me and the only time I don’t feel anxious is when I’m fucked up. I feel like I keep digging myself into a deeper and deeper hole. I am also extremely depressed in general and have had a hard time processing some things that have happened to me, and unfortunately I use drugs and alcohol to cope and I don’t know how to escape that. 

I also have a tendency to “trauma dump”  on people, or just talk about really personal things that have happened in my life and cry when I get really fucked up, which makes me feel so anxious, awful, and embarrassed and is obviously a vibe kill.  

I also feel like I’d never be able to get a hold of my drug problem while being with my partner. My partner and their friends drink a lot and do a fair amount of drugs, they all have slight substance issues but I feel like my substance issues become everyone’s problem. It is just hard because I have tried to clean myself up before but I just feel so alone, because the people closest to me can’t really support me because they will still do substances. I am around substances all the time, and feel like I don’t really have any self control. I love my partner so much though, and in my mind this issue is not nearly enough of a problem to end the relationship. A part of me also feels like the severe anxiety I am facing is mainly due to the fact that I’m generally just mentally ill, not drugs. 

To be honest, I don’t even know who I am without drugs and I worry that I will become boring or something(?) I don’t really know how to describe…

I love myself the most on drugs but I also hate myself the most. 

I am a extremely anxious person about pretty much everything in general, but the anxiety I just described is one of the main ones that consumes my mind, and caused me to feel really suicidal if I think about it for too long. 

If anyone has any advice on how to deal with these feelings it would be greatly appreciated.

1meu472,Nobody knows about my drug addiction except for my dealer..,"I (23f) have used meth as my daily coffee for about two, almost three years. First thing I do is eat, smoke, hygiene, and go about my day. I’d call myself a pretty functional addict. I buy $40 worth every month and have never crossed the limit. Until I met my now boyfriend. 

He’s a wonderful man and everything I could ever ask for. I ended up moving in with him so I stopped smoking for 4 months straight without telling anyone. The withdrawal was HORRIBLE and the hardest thing I’ve ever done alone.(Blamed the attitude/irritability on getting birth control) 

I recently relapsed due to accidentally signing up to work three jobs. With 16hr workdays I was averaging 4 hrs of sleep a night while still trying to manage to cook dinner for us. (He pays all the bills) I was definitely crashing out but he stepped in to help and my 3 jobs turned to one. Now I have a normal schedule and I should quit smoking..

But I bought $100 worth this time. And I just signed up for a 1 month course for a certification program. I want to flush my stash away and crush my pipe everyday. But I don’t wanna fail my $900 classes because of withdrawal symptoms. Nor go through withdrawal alone again. 

Having nobody to support and encourage sobriety is hard. The only reason I want to quit is from fear of being caught & betraying everyone. I jokingly asked my boyfriend what he would do if he caught me smoking weed. And he said it would be a dealbreaker. He’s very strict on no drugs.. yet almost walked in on me smoking in the bathroom. I’m so scared to work full time while going through withdrawal… 

So my question is, should I wait for the right timing and use up the stash? Or stop smoking and only snort to control doses and then slowly decrease them? I went cold turkey before but I don’t think that’s smart to do right now…  ",1754048225.0,73,75,addiction,addiction
1mfeacc,My best friend of almost 20 years is addicted to cocaine and he’s ruining his life.,"My best friend since i’ve known since I was 8 (let’s call him “Y” broke up with his girlfriend of 7 years around May of this year and has been spiraling out of control. It’s affecting his relationships and friendships and I don’t know what to do and I want to help him. 
   It’s tearing me apart, the man I grew up with is no longer here and there’s no signs of him stopping. Not only a year ago this same man used to get up at 6am everyday and go to the gym, invest in stocks, work 6 sometimes 7 days a week super friendly super charismatic, my own family loves him and he was considered family. He eventually found some bad influences at his work and ended up doing lots of coke with his coworkers, at first it was a little bit, but eventually turned into a problem. I’ll be honest there were times where I would join in on his fun to where we got real drunk and he gave me a heart to heart about how unhappy he is with his relationship: dead bedroom, bad attitude, etc. Few months later he tells me he cheated on her with a girl he met from his work and I eventually tell
him that he has to tell his GF, he breaks up with her and he moves out of his GF’s moms house. 

  At this point he is practically homeless and my mom was kind enough to allow him to stay until he gets back on his feet. He’s still working a lot and seeing this new girl that he’s been seeing. After maybe a month he loses his job because his boss was an asshole and started firing people left and right, him included. Me and my roommate “B” who Y is also good friends with let him stay for a week in our apartment until eventually he starts to break boundaries. He steals ab’s car without asking drunk in the process to go buy coke downtown. B was absolutely angry and tells him to bring his car back immediately. Y apologizes and a few days later I have a serious conversation with him about his situation, he starts crying and goes on about how he thinks about his ex when he’s sober etc.

  He leaves the apartment that morning but I notice that he’s still out there in the car what seems to be almost an hour. I go out there and ask what he’s still doing here, I get in the car I find a suicide note that he just wrote while in the car and I freak out. He tells me to take his gun away from him and that’s when I threaten to get him baker acted. Looking back i should’ve done this but I didn’t. 

  Last month my mom calls me and tells me he’s not respecting the rules of her house and that she doesn’t want him there anymore, my mom knows his mom and she threatened to call her about what’s happening to him. I’m angry at this point because he’s taking advantage of her kindness and I tell him that she’s threatening to call his parents to which he says they’d disown me if they found out about everything that’s been going on. Mind you theyre hyper religious and he had a rough childhood. 

  Y is practically homeless, he’s spending god knows how much money on cocaine and liquor, hes breaking boundaries with me, my friends, and family. I know that I should just tell my mother to kick him out but I can’t bring myself to do that. He’s turning into a tweaker and I don’t wanna see my best friend fall down an abyss. It’s breaking my heart. This is the same man that would talk to me about investing in stocks, the man who was an extremely talented audio engineer and had studio sessions with big names, he’s throwing it all away. 

I’m desperate for advice. I don’t want to just cut him off after everything we’ve been through. I’m afraid he’ll go too far to where I’d have to cut ties with him.

So i wondered what changed specifically? And i found out about patch notes. 

From there onwards, i wohld CAREFULLY analyze every patch note that came out of every single game i played, and i got so obsessed with patch notes to the point where i would watch patch notes of games i didn't even play. 

I started comparing every single thing and even watching previous patch notes before the current version i started playing a specific game to understand the devs balancing mindset and how far they had come. 

My friends often ask me for meta advice in clash royale when i don't even have the game installed but i know the meta 24/7.

It got so bad where i started proposing balancing patch notes on the Lords Of The Fallen (2023) subreddit and even on my insta posts whenever i would be doing upgrades to my account i would start with a title like:

Recently I got back into benzos due to stress and losing focus on what matters.  It took me down incredibly fast.  I was arrested for DUI and felony possession.  I lost my six figure job and luckily my oldest child went on a vacation with her grandma and my youngest is too young to have any memory of the incident.  

After I got clean I had a seizure and dislocated both arms.  To be clear:  lost my job, arrested for DUI and felony, lost all trust with my wife and lost the ability to use my arms for several weeks for anything significant.  

My wife stood by me because it had been ten years since I had a slip up.  I hired a lawyer and he was able to get them to drop all charges (extremely lucky I know!)

1mf22gf,My partner’s boss is unknowingly about to enable his addiction,"My partner’s boss is unknowingly about to enable his addiction—and I’m the one left to pick up the pieces.

We live in Utah.

(35F, with two kids, living with 40M partner who’s addicted to meth)

I’m in an impossible situation. My partner (40M), who I live with and share two young daughters with, is actively addicted to meth. And his boss—who clearly means well—is about to help him open a bank account. Sounds harmless, right?

Here’s the reality: if he has access to even $10, he’ll leave work and use. That’s not an exaggeration. Just last week, his mom gave him $20 and he used it as an excuse to take time off and relapse. This isn’t new. It’s been years of him burning every chance, every job, every bit of help.

His current job is the only thing keeping us afloat right now. I don’t have a support system. Rent is outrageous. I’m about to start college and I’m doing everything I can to finally build independence and get my girls into a better life. But I’m still here. Not because I want to be—but because I can’t afford to leave yet.

The warehouse he works at gave him a second chance after he burned his last job. They even gave him a company truck out of kindness. He used it to get high and drive around watching porn. I had a way to track him because I knew it would happen. I’ve seen this pattern too many times.

Right now, I’m holding onto his prepaid cards. That was the plan—agreed to by his mom, and even by him when he’s coming down. It’s the only thing that’s helped him stay barely stable. But now his boss is trying to help him get a bank account. She doesn’t know how dangerous that is. She doesn’t know that access to money is the trigger.

And I can’t reach out to her. Apparently, if anyone talks to her about something she’s doing, she calls people out directly and creates tension. I don’t want him to lose this job—but I know what’s coming. It’s always the same.

I’m trying to keep it together, raise my daughters, and build a future out of this mess. But I feel like I’m carrying a dam that’s about to break—and the person pulling the pin thinks they’re helping.

Just needed to get this out. I’m tired of living like this. I’m trying to climb out, but everything feels like it’s working against me. ",1754067919.0,7,15,addiction,addiction

  I'm a 20(M) year old and I've had relationships throughout the years, but for some reason I have never been truly happy, or maybe it's better to say satisfied? 
  The people I have been with are absolutely wonderful and great in their own ways. I have always done my best for my partners and always tried to be a good bf. Everytime I think I'm happy or in a good relationship with someone I am attracted to; suddenly I just one day start feeling empty or possibly a void I always have. 
 Anyway I just for some reason start to desire other people, I don't know why. I was a serial cheater during high school and I couldn't stop. I now avoid relationships and getting too close to people. I have some weird addiction to getting with someone and then after a little while I start to desire the love or touch of someone else even though I'm happy who I am with at the time. 
If there's a way to stop this or make the desire subside I would love to hear something I can do. I genuinely don't like my problem and I just want to fix myself.

How many years have a been a weed addict now? I'd say about 12. How many years have I been an alcoholic? About 9. 

The best things about not smoking weed for me is getting to actually be able to remember most of my dreams which are usually really interesting. 

I also love being able to save money because I can't when I smoke weed, I go through an ounce in like a week because I'm smoking two grams a day and giving half of it away to my neighbor. 

I set a future quit date but I'm not sure it'll play out. 5 months of no smoking from next Sunday August 10 to January 10 of 2026. 

That would make for over 152 days and Alcohol I've went 168 days without drinking and 1,672 without cigarettes so that's should be easy to do.

I know she also does coke but not to what extent. She also struggles a lot with her mental health (depression, anxiety). After rehab she was advised to not go back to work and I know that was really hard for her. She’s ended up back in inpatient a few times since (or least she’s hinted at that with me). She’s also now going through a divorce. 

I try to send light encouraging messages every few days that don’t need a response (things like “I love you! I’m proud of you!”). She’s also told me she’s been having manic episodes and I think the times I hear back from her it’s usually during those - we’ll chat for a few days (generally late at night) and then she’ll go dark. I haven’t seen her in person since May. She’s isolated herself from most of her other friends because she feels ashamed and embarrassed.

We had been texting pretty regularly for about two weeks and she told me she was doing cocaine- just casually mentioned should I have another line? Any time she brings up cocaine I don’t shame her but don’t encourage. I haven’t heard from her since the end of our convo that night. 

Two questions I need advice on: (1) at some point should I anonymously call where I know she was doing IOP/OP and tell them about the cocaine? (2) she’s still living with her ex while they figure out housing but at some point is it worth going to her house just to check in on her and be like “I’m here for support”?

She’s told me before she’s so grateful for me support and she feels like she’s never had support like she does from me.

Since starting non-stimulant ADHD medication, my impulses have gotten much more manageable and for a period of a few months my erratic behaviour and substance abuse was under control.

My partner has only ever been patient and as understanding as they can be. I find myself lying to them as a knee jerk reaction whenever I'm caught out during periods of use.

This past week I have been lax on taking my medication following a party at the weekend, and it's resulted in me using several times.

My partner has called me out on it and I've reactively lied about my use, only later in the week being truthful.

I love my partner, and she does not deserve what I put her through whilst trying to manage my behaviour. She is understandably at the end of her tether.

My name is Sash, 28 Y O female, and I’m here to try and articulate my struggle with addiction over the last 8 years. 
I began taking cocaine when my mum got diagnosed with cancer. I know my story does not make me any more special than the next. Cancer seems to be more common than the clap these days, but I have never felt so alone in my journey which I see play out in different households, soaps on TV, everyday. I have only ever touched the devils dandruff, can you believe me? When I say.. I actually fear drugs. It’s hilarious in a dark way the fact I have become such a hard addict when in truth the effects of drugs scare me. To my knowledge I have only ever taken cocaine, I am not the type to pop a pill or have ever taken MDMA. Have I mentioned yet I am a mum? Within my 8 years trapped in this hell hole of a disease, I have found the link between ADHD & cocaine, and with knowing what I know it has shed just a little of the guilt and shame I feel toward my addiction. I was never and have never been introduced to cocaine on the social scene, ie.. the club. How do I explain a line of coke helps me get my jobs done round the house, be present with my child.. I honestly see cocaine sometimes like an extra scoop of coffee for someone, or a redbull.. 
anyway within the 8 years, I have turned from a 20 year old girl with minimal responsibilities, a lot of money in the bank obtained by working a job 40 hours a week like I had 3 kids at home to feed ( I liked money) and at the time.. living at home with mama therefore other than my phone bill my income was entirely mine. 
To now being a 28 year old woman and mother.. money doesn’t come as fast as it used too, for fucks sake we are in a cost of living crisis.. I need to stop this behaviour. It’s an expensive habit, so this is my journey on to trying to crack this…

1meeevq,How to deal with internet / gaming addiction?,"I was looking for the right sub. Not sure if it is right here, but I believe I have internet and gaming addiction. Mostly just numbing myself by being on the internet. And it has been going on for years, basically already when Facebook started off. People were surprised seeing me post so much. Then came gaming, on and off. But mostly just the internet, for some time it was 4chan. I was addicted of posting there. Always escaping from real life, always escaping from living in a rough neighbourhood (not any longer there) or living in an anonymous city. I am ashamed of how much I posted and looked at the internet, of how much I consumed and saved. I hope that all my 4chan posts from years ago are all gone. Then came Instagram, then came TikTok. Always numbing myself and now it is Reddit too, it is X, it is Tiktok (currently uninstalled), but always something, and Dota2 gaming too. I feel like such a loser, so awkward. I cannot tell anyone these things. Or how much I saved from the internet on my hard drive, so many images, it is sick. Only now I realize that my life was always about numbing myself and I even worked as a copywriter, filling the internet with more stuff. Always had social problems and felt not liked in school. I am good at masking and now I do not look like a gamer or online addicted person. I am on the autistic spectrum and just feed on all the information.

1mea9bt,What is what,"Weed, opioids, molly, my favorites. I cant do life sober anymore. The first substance to abuse was ofc alcohol, bu wasnt my vibe really, it was just available, it usually just made me sad. But the mentioned above those are something else, especially opioids… Well my point is, i struggled mentally far before i got addicted, my life was unbearable, drank always when i had a place to do it on my own, i am not a socially wasted type usually. My point is especially when starting opioids, my life got better, i did all the tasks i should have, moving through life easily. Even other people noticed, mentioned i changed for good and felt happy and content just existing which was never me before, but when they mentioned it, it made me a bit sad, because i knew why i could suddenly be myself with no fear. The thing is i have been abusing some type of opioid for the past half year and i dont have the energy to deal with being myself, sober and miserable, especially if i was never happy before in the beggining, why deal with wd, paws amd shit, if my baseline where i started is fucked anyways? Also, antidepressants cause wd also, so wtf are my options even? But i mean drugs are not all bad i think, had some therapeutic rolls on M, but i had to be in a good mindset and in general they can be fun, a joint to chill out a pill to handle a hard day full of idiots. Idek what my point is, i think i am kinda losing it as the benzos are kicking in (currently sustaining on benzos and kratom for wd, because i have to financially survive and i wanna get my tolerance down) the point being nothing is black or white, but i think people take life too seriously, we are here for a short time and someone like me with trauma and shitty life circumbstances, i think there is no reason to suffer just for the sake of it, to be able to say i am sober. We all will die, nothing is as serious in the end. And personally i dont affect others with my addiction, literally no one knows, i still have great friendships and relationships with people around me, never felt the push to steal on benzos, i think some people just need an excuse in form of drugs, for why they are shitty people.",1753988485.0,2,2,addiction,addiction

1mduam4,"I'm 17, and an addict.","Alcohol, weed, psychedelics. Nothing past that, I know myself and I know I can't regulate my usage, so anything harder would be asking for a life ending addiction. I cant go a day without intoxication. It has been like this for years and I don't know how much longer I can take it.

I yearn for the life I could have lived if I had stayed far away from drugs, but I know I would have found some other addiction outside of it. Video games, binge eating, sex. It's all the same - a meaningless dead end escape from the stress of the world. The more time I spend escaping, the more dreadful my time spent feels when I'm sober. It feels like an endless battle. The guilt of even typing this feels atrociously unbearable, because I know there are people on this earth with REAL addictions. I know people who are far less capable than I am have overcome alcohol addictions, and ""weed addictions"", but I can't help but feel like my case goes farther, and deeper than that. It's not an addiction to one specific drug, but rather intoxication itself. ANYTHING to help me escape.

I wish I knew how to help myself. I wish I could enjoy this gift of life that God has given me but I can't help but hate every second of it. I'm so fucking worried I don't know where I'll be in a year, or two, or five or if I'll even be here in ten. I know if I keep doing what I've been doing then I will make it nowhere in life, but trying to dig out of the hole ive dug myself into feels like a helpless never ending game, where I always end up losing. I'm so worried I'll disappoint my family. People already see me as a loser. An addict. I have no close friends. All of the people I choose to surround myself with are surface level, and I know I could never trust them, and it feels so fucking lonely. I feel like this generation has lost its sense of genuineness. Everything is transactional. No one shows TRUE empathy. It might be narcissistic or egotistical for me to think this way, but I might be the only empathetic person left on the fucking planet. No one has decency anymore and it sickens me to my core.

1mdw7a4,From 2–3 times a day to 3 years clean (looong post),"I thought Id make a more exstensive post on my journey, and break down a bit of the full picture on how I managed to break porn addiction and the need for constant release, what worked and why it did when nothing else did.

Ive been clean for close to 3 years now. And this is after being addicted for over 10 years, doing it 2-3 times a day, **EVERY day**. Once I found out that porn was a problem, I did like most of you, and followed the nofap advice... eventually, I relapsed after 1 week, 30 days and even 90+ days. Nothing stuck.. until I cracked the code myself.

This thing runs deep, and most guys fail because they are fighting part of the problem. Its not just about urges, or habits or motivation. Its about the system you use to approach this issue, your paradigm and your brain itself.

Let me explain...

There was a point in my life where I had almost given up on fighting my addiction because it seemed fruitless. No matter what I did, eventually I would fall back, and it started to seem that pmo would always be a part of my life. I had almost started to accept it. Obviously not in a proud way. I hated it. I hated how I felt after. I hated the emptiness. I hated how it robbed me of peace. How it messed up my attraction to real women. How it made me numb, tired, foggy, anxious, ashamed.

But I still kept doing it, despite being in internal conflict with myself.  
I would wake up with a strong intention to stay clean, and then by 2PM, I was already looking for an excuse. Something to justify the relapse. A rough day. A bit of loneliness. A scroll too far on Instagram. A fight with my girl. A bad night’s sleep.  
Anything.

And every time I relapsed, I’d go back to trying to “fix” myself with **external solutions**:

* I’d go harder at the gym
* I’d meditate longer
* ’d cut out sugar
* I’d delete all my apps
* I’d track my streak like it was life or death

And every time I relapsed again, I’d blame it on what I didn’t do:

* “I skipped gym today that’s why I relapsed.”
* “I had too much caffeine, so I was anxious, that’s why I relapsed.”
* “I didn’t journal this morning, that’s why I relapsed.”

So I doubled down. Did more. Became stricter. Built more routines. More rules.  
And still the cycle continued for a long time.

**Streak -> Relapse -> Longer streak -> More relapses**

You see, I thought the problem was that I wasnt doing enough, and thats why I couldn't create a life so good that I ""just didt pmo"". But in reality, I was productive, I had goals, I was in shape, I was going places. So the issue was not with my habits or way of life...

It was not until I realized that I have a corruption in my brain... my operating system. It would just glitch and find its way back, because I had been conditioning it to do so.

Through thousands of repetitions, I had trained my brain to solve everything with PMO:

* Bored? PMO.
* Happy? PMO.
* Sad? PMO.
* Lonely? PMO.
* Just horny? PMO.
* Existing? PMO.

My brain had one response to any emotional state or situation: **stimulate yourself.**

And no matter how good my habits were, no matter how “motivated” I felt, the truth was that my mind had a script, and it would keep running it unless I rewrote it.

That’s when I stopped trying to fight the addiction from the outside (habits, goals, schedules) and started **fighting it from the inside.**

So eventually,  
every time I felt the urge to PMO, no matter how small, I didn’t run from it.  
I didn’t go on a walk, distract myself, or white knuckle it.  
I sat down and wrote.

I wrote down:

* The time
* What triggered the urge
* How strong it was
* And most importantly… what the voice in my head was saying

See, I started giving that voice a persona and a name. I called it **the parasite**. Because that’s what it felt like, this slimy, manipulative little entity in my mind, always whispering justifications.

It would say things like:

* “You’ve been so productive this week, you deserve this.”
* “It’s just a little peek, not a full relapse.”
* “You’ll regret it, but that regret will fuel a better streak tomorrow.”
* “Just get it over with, then start fresh after.”

**Lies. All of it.**

But for the first time, I saw the lies clearly. Because I took the time to observe theem and once I wrote them down, I wrote a response, from my true self. The real me.

Something like:  
“You’re tired and overstimulated. Porn will only make it worse. You’ll feel even more drained after. Just breathe, drink water, step outside for 5 minutes. That’s real selfcare, not this illusion the parasite is selling you.”

And by doing this, urge after urge, day after day, I started creating a new script in my brain.  
And eventually, this became the standard condition in my mind.

Everytime I had an urge, no matter what triggered it, my brain would follow the pathways of:

1. identifiying the part of myself (parasite) and its lies, and
2. answers these lies with the truth.

You know how it is to talk to someone you 100% know is lying, and just listening to them talk and knowing very well that if you follow what they are saying, it wont lead to a good place.

It became something like that.

And through this process of installing a new mental condition...  
I went from 1 day clean, to 10, 100 and now 3 years clean from porn...

1mdj8w7,Who else used to have a group of friends that they've used drugs with regularly or at least very frequently?,"In 2012-2014, we were older teenagers who liked to drank beer and smoke weed at teen-friendly parties in Ontario regularly. Very rarely would there be noise complaints or anytimes we needed the police involved. Most times it was just a bunch of teenagers having a real good time (and we sure did). 

Then from 2014-2019, I'd be doing the same activities but with a different crowd of people. In the early 2010s, the people I was smoking and drinking with were employed people who tackled their responsibilities in life. Almost nobody in the circle from 2014-2019 I was associating with had any type of employment. 

But you know the worst of this? I became a worse person than any of the people I've let take advantage of me for drug habits because I did the same shit to my own parents from 2020-2025. 

I just turned 30 on Sunday and I've done the same stuff to my parents that people did to me. I'd ask my Mom and Dad for money (to go to beer/weed/cigarettes) and they'd always tell me ""No!"". 

I'd never take ""No!"" for an answer and would bully and belittle them in attempts for them to send money. 

Now I don't want this behaviour. What really helped, for instance today (7/30) I was collecting cans and I'd be finding like 100 cans in an hour. 

We have a system in Ontario with 10 cent empty returns on beer cans. So if you bring in 300 cans you'd get $30 type thing. It's a great system really.

I've lost 90% of my friends in the last year of my life and it's my own fault for addiction issues.

Only bright side is I didn’t end up having to pay her we just got high and messed around a bit. 

I plan to go off of adderal, because I think it makes me more willing to make these decisions. 

Before going back on I was in a good place focused on my studies and making good progress. 

Now it’s like the line between the choice to use and the action is invisible. I need to go full sober (including adderal). It’s the only way through.

1mdgbcq,"Distractions, things to keep busy","Hello, Ive been smoking weed everyday non stop for 3 years consistently. If context helps: Im lazy and unmotivated and I have responsibilities and goals that I can’t keep up with in my current state and I know quitting weed would be a game changer for me, and definitely would be in my best interest. This isn’t new for me, I’ve been trying to quit for over a year now and although I’ve only been smoking 3 years, i find it really hard to stop because it’s become my norm. Also Ive been told I may just have an addictive personality type which doesn’t help. 

What I’m asking is what are some things that have been helpful to you or someone you know who’s struggled with addiction? My main hobbies besides smoking weed are drumming, video games, watching shows, sometimes journaling outside. But nothing really does it for me, im always craving it. I know nothing will cure my addiction except hard work and persistence but if anyone has any suggestions on ways to distract yourself from using, I’d appreciate some ideas.

1md791i,Signs of 7OH or Kratom addiction,"Hey everyone! For background, I’m on day 6 of withdrawals and feeling a lot better. I’m trying to be very active on here, cuz I find that having this online support has kept me going! I already posted this on the quitting7oh community, but I want to put this here too. 

Anyways, let’s talk about signs of 7OH addiction. First starting with,

PHYSICAL:

1: Pupils When someone is high on 7OH or other opioids, there pupils shrink drastically. It’s kinda of scary. But try and remember that this out of their control. When they withdrawl, their pupils will rebound and get very big. Now everyone’s pupils change size with the lights, but if ur in the dark and notice that someone still has small pupils that is a sign they are on opiates.

2: Constant Itching For many people (myself included) I was constantly itching my face and other areas. To the point that redness started to develop.

3: Teeth Clenching Now, I haven’t heard many other people talk about this one. It’s very possible that I was laced with that amphs, cuz that’s a common side affect of those drugs. However I noticed that I was constantly biting down on my teeth and tongue cuz it would make me feel more euphoric.

4: Sweat Smell Whenever anyone abuses a substance for a long time, it starts to infect their body fluids. 7OH has a rather strange and musty stench to it. It kinda smelled like chalky to me, but regardless if u notice that someone’s sweat smells strange that is a sign of addiction.

5: Weight loss and constipation Lots of people find that many drugs (7oh included) kills apitete. And acctually makes it hard to finish a full meal. This often results in fast weight loss and less interest in sharing food. If u notice that someone is not eating as much as they used to, add that to ur suspicion. Also it causes constipation and makes it hard to urinate. So they might spend quite some time in the bathroom, despite rarely eating.

6: Trouble swallowing and dry mouth. This was my LEAST favorite side effect. It seemed like my body was in capable of swallowing food, unless it was liquid. I would constantly be spitting things out cuz I didn’t want to choke. And my seemed dry as a desert constantly!

7:  Pacing around Now this very well could be a symptom of my bipolar or a biproduct in the pills I was taking. However, I would never sit down for things. I was constantly pacing around listening to music or on my phone. Even for dinners I would walk around, so possibly look out for this as well.

Nows let’s talk about..

MENTAL:

1: Quick irritation. This is a very common sign for all drug abuse. People who may have been super quiet or friendly may seem more prone to irritation. I’m not saying that all drugs turn people into abusive monsters, BUT, they certainly will be more likely to get irritated even at unexpected things.

2: Loss of sex drive 7OH for me absolutely killed my sex drive. I simply wasn’t interested in it anymore. Finishing seemed like an impossible task anyways, even if I was aroused, so I mostly just gave up.

3: Loss of passions Before my 7OH addiction. I loved biking, swimming, playing video games, reading, and more. However, after, I loss complete interest in all of that. Instead, I would spend all of my time on my phone in my room :(

Ok, so the last indicator is.

FINANCIAL:

7oh starts off really cheap, with only like 5 dollars for 30 mgs. But with its short half life, it quickly builds into a very expensive habit. I was spending 30-60 dollars a day. And I’ve heard much worse. This makes the addiction impossible to hide forever. If u see a lot of gas station, smoke shop, or convenience store chargers that is the ultimate sign that someone may be struggling with 7oh or kratom addiction. They may tell u that it’s weed or cigarettes, BUT as someone who was addicted to both, I never had to spend that much on those.

Ok, so that was my list. Lmk what u guys think, or any others I may have missed. Good luck to everyone struggling with this addiction, WE DO RECOVER",1753883731.0,2,3,addiction,addiction
1md6zzo,"16, 3 weeks clean off weed, my story.","So this may be very long, but I want to share what I’ve been going through, and maybe someone can give advice, or share the same experience. Here it goes. 
So a little background on who I am, I’m now 16 year old boy, junior, very competitive swimmer (all-state, school record holder, this all makes sense in the story), and I am 3 weeks clean off weed. I started to experiment the spring of 2024 and it was only once. Then I started to use it a bit more in the summer but maybe a few times in August. Keep in mind at this time I was stealing this from my mom who didn’t know at the time. I never thought I would ever buy one of my own, nor thought I would ever get addicted to using it. So fast forward a few months, and I started to plan that I would every Friday. And at this point, school had started up for about a month, and every week I would look forward to that Friday after I got off the bus because no body was home and I could steal weed from my moms bag and no one would notice. It was also very nice out so that made the high even better. At this point I wasn’t obsessing over it through the week, but it started to get the point. Not long after that, those Friday’s became fridays and Saturday’s, then soon after Sundays. In my head I thought, “well I’m using my moms and gunna get caught, so I’m just gunna get my own and only use on Friday and Saturday.” After I got my own cart, this soon spiraled. During the time I got my own, I was hanging out a lot with my swim team before the season started, and watching all the older kids smoke weed and I would ask for hits and they would let me. This wasn’t the start of our bond bc I’ve known a lot of these kids from way before highschool (they were seniors I was a softmore at this time) and they are really good kids, just I should not have been getting high with them. They were also the ones who told me who to buy from, so I trusted this plug. My first ever cart that I bought was a fluid brand and that is when (and I now admit it) when my addiction started. I would come home from swim practice in the fall and hop in my shower and get blasted. And every time I smoked I would tell myself “I am going to reach a new peak” and I held that same mentality for about 8 months. Now at the time where I did start using daily because it was so easy to use bc I had one, I really started to feel guilt. One of my coaches who at the time I really looked up to, and who would push me to my max would so be against this as any coach would, and that stuck in my head. But as I would for 8 months, I would try to numb that guilt, and I got really good at it. In practice I would say to myself “no one knows what I’m doing, and everyone would hate me for it.”I would think that they would think I’m wasting my potential, and tbink I’m some dick because I’m a top ranked swimmer in my state, smoking weed every day.” And that broke me for about 8 months, but I would just drain it out. And during my high school season which is the season I focus the most on, becuse of my high expectations and goals that I had. My goals were going all state and making the state open which is top 20 in your event. But what’s interesting at this time was I was smoking so much weed, it felt like I had those goals in my head, but never really felt that I had them locked in because I would just go home and get really high. Also when the high school season started, my mental health started to decline fast. I became so anxious through out the day, It felt like I was contained to my own body in a way that felt like de-realization. I dojt know how to explaine it. But I’m a really talkative kid and VERY extroverted and I wasn’t. Especially look back now, I’m clean, talking to a therapist, and on escitalopram, I really see the difference in how I felt.  And to top this guilt off, my dad is my coach and I would hear what he think about the kids who smoke, and told me if I ever did I would be wasting all my potential and (I also believed this) but it felt like he implied a looser. He’s taken a very good stance on this situation but I felt this before I got caught. During this swim season, I would think all day that I’m not going to go home and smoke, but what did i do right after practice? Get obliterated. It was wierd how I felt. In the bus ride to school, I would still be laggy, sometimes still kinda high becuse I would stay up till mid night smoking, but I would tell my self that I’m done feeling this way, but the moment I got out of practice at 530pm, I would have this rush of happiness and tell myself “I’m Gunna get so fucking high” and I was happy too, so that’s what I did. This would repeat every day for about 8 months. After swim meets, I would go in my senior fridns car, or the bathroom of where ever and get high, they would drive me home high. I never felt bad about it then bc all the older kids were and I would be in relays with them bc I’m the fastest backstroker on the team and the 2nd fastest free styler. Coming up to the state meet, and my APUSH exam, oh yea for school I was missing assignments, grades were slipping. I am a A B student but I became a C low B student. But coming up to the state meet and the exam I told my self I’m not smoking before this bc it’s too important. I smoked the day before both of them. And the days leading up before them. And beofre the state meet I told my self I wouldn’t but did. And I also told myself that I don’t wanna go all state or drop time in my backstroke bc it would be a sign. I also said if I did get all state I would stop because if I’m all state, one of the best backstrokers in the state, I can’t be wasting that smoking weed. I also told myself it’s not fair to others who work harder than me, not doing drugs every day for me to get it instead of them. I dropped 2 secs in my backstroke and got all state. But what didn’t change? I kept smoking weed every day. This wasn’t gunna change. I needed to get caught. If this wasn’t gunna stop me, nothing will. Also before this I would throw carts away to stop, but I would just keep buying more. And during this season my mental health was so bad. I would cry in the stall after prac for no reason. This one time was rlly bad - I came home from prac and sat in my bathroom, turned the shower on and just cried for 30 mins. Why? No reason I could think of. Looking now my brain was just fucked up. But there was one time that I thought of writing a memoir on how I felt incase I killed my self. So I needed to get caught to stop and I told myself that and I hoped for it and I prayed that I would. But at the same time, I would keep telling myself every day I’m not gonna smoke and then go home and get high. So fast-forward to when I got caught, my mom found three carts in my bed and she found carts in my room that were empty. She found boxes she found nips. We had a conversation and I told her everything I told her how bad the situation was because at this point there was no hiding it and I wanted this to happen. I was seeing a therapist at the time before I got caught, but she told him. I begged my mom not to tell my dad because I thought he would hate me. I had every reason to. I hated me. But he took a really good stance on it and at the end of the day I needed help. Now I’m being tested every week and I was at a 5/5 which means daily use. Oh, I forgot to say this after I got caught I was told I was getting tested next week, but my mom found all the stuff she threw it away and guess what I did, went through the trash, told myself one more time, and I kept doing it for four more days, and my mom found the cart that I cut out the trash in my bed. And I know what I think because that’s my brain, but from her perspective, she had a son who was an addict. and that scared the fuck out of me. So now I’m clean. I feel so much better but this is a question I do have. Almost every day I have dreams that I’m smoking weed and I think I’m gonna get caught. I’m being tested but in my dream I still do it and when I wake up, I feel holy shit. What the fuck did I do? I’m gonna get caught. So I don’t know if that means anything, but I’m not smoking in real life. But almost every day for three weeks in my dreams I smoke weed and it’s very weird. Looking back and I told my therapist this everything about that was wrong but through smoking weed, I will say that I gained a lot of knowledge on perspective and what I think about myself because when I was high, I would think about what I’m doing and how long it is and I would think about how I’m gonna fix it and I ended up acting on that. I also got really interested in politics and thinking about world problems and the better for humans and I still carry that same interest to this day. Which really interesting as I used to be a very very Republican person and now I’m independent left leaning so my mindset changed. And I lost my previous mindset on first not doing drugs, but also using signs from G-d. I have medical problems and my parents have really praised me on this, but I’ve always had the mindset of. I can’t change it so why would I complain about it? I’m gonna learn about it and spread my story. So throughout smoking weed, this was gone and that devastated me because I really appreciated that about myself and that’s one of the things I love myself about. So now my next step is to share the story no matter how embarrassing it is and how terrible it is to say because I don’t want anyone to feel the same way I did. 
If someone read this entire story, thank you I don’t think I’m the only one with this story but if you can answer my question about the dreams, please do or if you can relate, please say.

1mcq1rp,To those who believe addiction is a choice..,"

I have recently heard multiple people saying that “addiction is a choice” As someone in active rehabilitation, I can assure you that it is not that simple. - Several years ago, my late Fiancé and I were t-boned by a drunk driver. He was killed. I broke my neck / spine (among other injuries) and was immediately placed on opiates. When I was discharged more than 2 months later, I left the hospital with a prescription. That same prescription was renewed nearly 4 years before I started buying extra from a dealer, in addition to my prescribed dose —because that's how addiction works. Over time.. your body just needs more. My now-Husband went through a similar path. His addiction also began with a prescription. We've both been in a treatment program together the last 3+ years. It's a battle-one we also CHOOSE to fight every single day. Choosing not to use, is often far more difficult than choosing to use. Recovery is considered an achievement because it is one. Addiction isn't just a bad decision you one day undo —it is a disease that rewires your brain, hijacks your sense of control, and convinces you that you need the very thing destroying you. To wake up every day and choose healing over escape, clarity over numbness, and life over chaos
—that's not just a choice. That's a victory.
Not all addiction looks the same. Some starts with a prescription, others with trauma, mental health struggles, or simply trying to escape pain. But once it takes hold, the fight is the same. —Sure some choose to use without reason, but at some point, after just a few short days.. your body becomes addicted, and by then, it is no longer just a “choice” because your body just NEEDS it, so you don’t become violently ill. Not understanding how difficult that process of addiction / recovery is —that's one thing. But belittling those who are actively choosing recovery, simply because you haven't experienced it yourself, is just ignorance.

So I was kicking it around hella junkie addicts in the cities basically homeless, trying to always find my next fix. One day another drug user told me about the $50 gift card to get the jab. 

Instead of thinking about doing this as a one time thing, I thought on how could I keep coming to these places. They had a sheet of where I could come in a few weeks and times of the next jab. They were going to a lot of underserved areas and non profits to find people in need. 

You didn’t need an ID for it (since they were targeting the vulnerable population like homeless people), so I used random soccer player names from the premier league in England and changed my outfits like crazy, sometimes came in my Muslim throne, other times I dress clean, other times I come in with wheelchairs , crutches, u name it. I got away with doing this for a month and a half straight before one lady recognized me from earlier in the week.

1md74zs,Title: I’m stuck in addiction and don’t know how to quit — I feel like I have no willpower left. Please help.,"Hi everyone,

I don’t really know how to start this. I’ve been struggling with an addictive substance (not sure if I should name it here), and no matter how many times I try to quit, I end up going back. Every time I tell myself “this is the last time,” I genuinely believe it — but then a few hours or days later, I give in again. The cycle repeats, and each time I fail, I feel more ashamed and weaker than before.

What’s hitting me the hardest is this feeling of having no willpower. I’ve read about discipline, building habits, and riding out urges — but when the craving hits, all that logic just vanishes. I feel like a different person who doesn’t care about the consequences. And once I give in, I hate myself for it.

I don’t want to live like this. I don’t want to be stuck in this loop anymore. But I also don’t know how to break free when I feel like my mind is working against me. It’s like I’m aware of what I should do, but I just… can’t.

If anyone has been in a similar place and found a way out, I’d be so grateful to hear how you managed it. How do you build real willpower when you feel like you’ve got none left? What worked for you in the early days of trying to quit? Any advice, even small steps, would mean a lot.

Thanks for reading.

There would be maybe a couple weeks where I ran out and would have to deal with it. Honestly I had a really good childhood and definitely have it easy then other people and when I was 16 my parents caught me a couple times and I felt really bad like my dad literally cried (dramatic okay) but I literally never stopped I would keep on doing it. I would smoke a pen all day at school for like three years. It kinda started cuz I was lonely but now I literally just do it just to do anything which I feel like is the hardest part. Then I started college last year and with this new free will I smoked everyday tbh and my friends didn’t rlly know of my addiction at all they just knew I did it sometimes and I completely also hid it from my boyfriend. I would always just feel like doing anything would be 100x better while I’m high as fuck and that was my downfall sadly . Like how do I find joy in anything when being high all the time made me soooo happy like I feel like I’ve been living a fake life now when I’m sober for like days and realize how boring my life is and sad I am.

1mctk8g,Addiction Treatment is like...,"DEFENSIVE DRIVING & SUD TREATMENT LESSON

Going to a residential addiction treatment program is like coming to a stop sign in the middle of the timeline of your life. Extended metaphor incoming: 

DOB--------🛑------------------>

Directions for a stop sign (for Americans at least, driving on the right, and correct, side of the road):

1) Come to a full and complete stop (stop the behaviors that got you to treatment, at least temporarily)

2) Look to the left (in traffic because they have the first chance to hit you, and on the timeline of your life you look back to the past and ask yourself, “How did I get here?”, identifying the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that led you to treatment)

3) Look to the right (in traffic only after the left is clear, and in treatment only after you accurately identified how YOU got HERE, and when you looktop the right on the timeline of your life you look to the future and ask yourself, “Where do I want to go from here?”, identifying six month, one year, and even longer term goals) NOTE: here is where different recovery goals including abstinence, moderation, and harm reduction all come in.

4) Look to the LEFT AGAIN (in traffic because while looking to the right, someone else may have appeared in the left and they STILL have the first chance to hit you, and in treatment you look to the past and ask yourself, “If what I've been doing that got me here isn't going to get me where I want to go, what needs to change?”) NOTE: Here is where different pathways come in and you should have full autonomy in WHAT needs to change and HOW to get there. 

5) Proceed with caution (on the road because not everyone stops and yields appropriately and just because you're a safe driver doesn't mean others are, and in treatment because the risk of overdose, suicide, and other significant life disruptions are greater AFTER treatment ends)

What do y'all think? Should this extended metaphor be included in my upcoming book about addiction, treatment, and recovery entitled ‘Beyond the Twelve?’

1mcuaff,Struggling with Ritalin Overuse and Withdrawal – Need Advice and Support,"Hi everyone,

I’m here to share my experience and hopefully get some advice from people who have been through something similar.

I was prescribed Ritalin for ADHD, but over time I started abusing it heavily. At my worst, I was taking around 15-20 pills per day, sometimes 5 pills every 2 hours or so. My sleep got down to just 2 hours a night, and the effects of the medication started wearing off faster and faster. Along with this, I experienced severe anxiety, restlessness, constant headaches, and even visual disturbances like seeing yellow spots. My heart rate was often very high, and I struggled to even keep my eyes fully closed when trying to sleep.

Recently, I ran out of my Ritalin, and now the withdrawal symptoms are hitting me hard. I feel extremely uncomfortable, dizzy, and my body aches, especially my stomach. Sometimes, my stool turns green, which worries me about my liver and kidneys. I know this is serious, but I haven’t been able to get proper help yet.

I’m scared and overwhelmed but want to get better. I’m reaching out here to see if anyone has advice on how to manage this withdrawal safely, or if anyone has been through similar experiences. How did you cope? What helped you the most?

1mcqt2d,Seeking Advice to Help a Friend,"Looking for some recommendations, resources, anything.. so I can effectively help my friend who is in rehab again fighting his alcohol addiction. 

He is a service member and this might result in his discharge being expedited as he has had multiple alcohol related incidents. He will be devastated when he is discharged and I know it will be a severe trigger for him to relapse. His family is not in a place to effectively help him, so our close friend group is determined to give him a safe space when he is discharged. We just don’t know where to start.

I’m just looking for any pointers, familiar experiences you might have had, references, etc that could help us maximize his recovery chances for when he’s out of the service. ",1753831199.0,1,7,addiction,addiction
1mckk8p,Any advice?,"My older brother is a meth addict and due to his addiction it’s has lead him to be homeless. He steals from my parents every chance he gets and he’s made some pretty nasty comments a brother should never say to his sister which has made me feel uncomfortable around him. Our sister passed away in 2023 and he was so lost in his addiction that he didn’t even come for the services. It’s only gotten worse from there. He is homeless and has a girlfriend who is also homeless that stays glued by his side. My parents DO NOT like her at all and my dad has even banned her from coming into the house. My brother and his girlfriend and HER FIVE KIDS lived with them for a little bit and it was just a disaster. Neither one of them worked and were becoming a financial burden on my parents. I say all this to ask.. how do we help? I tried to talk to him about rehab but he refused saying that 3-6 months was too long to go without a job (even though he hasn’t had one in years) He only comes by when he needs money, clothes washed, food or to take a shower in the backyard of my parents house. And he always brings his girlfriend too. My mom has stopped in the middle of dinner to fix them something to eat. I tell her that we aren’t letting them hit rock bottom so they will not see how bad their situation is. They know they can just come over when they need something. They have begged to stay in the house again but my parents rules were: get help, no drugs, no girlfriend moving in & to get a job. He has not taken up the offer bc he doesn’t want to leave his girlfriend. His girlfriend has had many people reach out to me saying they are having the same struggle with her, almost the exact same situation with her family wanting/offering to pay for her to get help, she steals from them too, they don’t want my brother living with her since she would stay with a sister and they want her working. Her husband has their 5 kids right now. She’s not even divorced. I feel so lost. Please tell it to me straight.. am I being hateful or ugly towards him? I just don’t think it’s fair for my parents to bend over backwards to give my brother food or money or even their energy. He comes by, gets what he needs and leaves. I’m the one who has to deal with my parents emotions after the fact. I feel that we can’t even grieve my sister because he is demanding so much attention. I refuse to give it to to him which makes my mom tell me I’m being evil and heartless. I can’t feel any compassion for him bc I tried to help and he doesn’t want it. I understand that we can’t help those who don’t want to be helped but I also feel my parents are enabling him and his girlfriend. Anyways if you’ve made it this far I’m grateful because this is feeling more like a rant BUT I would appreciate some advice or really anything on this situation.

1mcfvs1,How do I move forward with my addict boyfriend,"My (ex?) boyfriend just admitted himself to 28 days of detox and rehab for his kratom use. I say “ex” with a question mark because after this weekend we’re at a point where I don’t know where we stand anymore. You can look at my previous post for more details, but for some background, when he was in active addiction his drugs of choice were cocaine, crystal meth, and kratom. He was heavily using all three and was put into a detox and rehab and then did sober living for 6 months. I didn’t know this at the time, but when we started dating he was only a few months out of his sober living, meaning he was only “sober” for roughly 7 months. At the time I thought he was very open about his addictions and that I knew the whole story. But I now know that he was omitting some of the truth. 
The reason he admitted himself to rehab today was because this weekend was the 3rd time I caught him with kratom. The first time I noticed he was using it was in December and I didn’t know what it was (nor did I know that was part of the reason he went to rehab in the first place) so I didn’t think anything of it. The second time, in March, I physically caught him hiding it and did some research and realized that this was a serious issue. He told me he would cut himself off from it using the quitting kratom subreddit, and I was pretty lenient with my boundaries. I told him that I wanted to test him for it, and he complied and that if I caught him again, I couldn’t continue to support him. Recently, in the past month or so, I began feeling suspicious of him again because he was acting differently and he was exhibiting concerning behaviors. On Sunday night I found 15 or so kratom tablets hidden in a pocket in his backpack. I took pictures, sent them to both of his parents. Then I confronted him and all he could say was “I don’t know what to say” and I asked him to leave. I ended up following him back so that I could get stuff of mine from his place and I made him wake up his father and admit what’s been happening. Last night he sat down with his parents and showed them his bank account so that they could see how much he was really spending on kratom, and I think this made him realize how much of a drain kratom has been on his finances. He was spending hundreds of dollars a week. Upon seeing this, his parents essentially gave him the ultimatum of getting help or kicking him out. Last night he called me and told me he that he was admitting himself to rehab because he was “finally ready to be rid of this” and that he can’t wait “to be clean again” and be “healthy and normal”. He also said that he can see me still being a part of his life without jeopardizing his recovery after rehab. Based on what happened in the past I am trying to remain skeptically optimistic. But it’s hard not to feel like this is a breakthrough because he’s finally being open and honest. 
Right now, I am at the point where after he gets out of rehab, and is a month free, I am willing to give him another chance to prove that he’s ready to live without kratom. Where I am struggling is with how I handle things after he gets out of rehab. I don’t want to give up on him completely, because I feel I wasn’t strong enough with my boundaries last time and neither of us really gave it a fair chance. However, I am open to criticism about my thought process. I do plan to start going to Nar-anon meetings this week so that I can be more prepared this time around. I guess I just need advice on if I’m doing the right thing by giving him another chance. My friends, who have not had any experiences with addicts, tell me that I should give up entirely because it’s hopeless. But in my heart I feel as though we could make things work, assuming he continues to work the program. What do I do?

1mcd9fa,In love with my ex who’s fighting Coke addiction,"TLDR; ex reached out about getting sober. We spent a beautiful night together which solidified my love for him all over again, and now he needs to be alone and work on figuring out who he is. Not sure how to deal with losing him again.

_____________

Not sure if this is the right place to post.

But my ex who I was in NC with (he left me, we just used to argue a lot), contacted me after 10 weeks saying that he finally told his mom about his addiction and is getting clean from coke. He needed to tell me this because I was the only person who saw the severity of it.

He had a problem when we were together and would lie, but I always knew. We had a few emotional moments where I begged him to tell his mom because he said it was the only thing that would make him stop. Adding : Overall he treated me with care and patience. He was/is a lovely person. I saw his soul. But he lacked direction. 

After the BU apparently he basically used every single day and was getting very little sleep, essentially just spiraling because he didn’t have me to hold him accountable. He told me everything about how bad it got and it broke my heart.

We spent a night together after he reached out and it felt so intense, real, emotional. He really looked at me with so much love. But this was his first real day sober. He was crying a lot and it broke my heart to see the mess he was in.

I ended up not hearing from him for 3 days after this, I knew he needed space. But I felt like I needed to still communicate and clarify what was going on between us. Yesterday he talked to me and went on about how he’s unsure of everything in his life, doesn’t know who he is without drugs, and needs to figure out his life. I told him I didn’t want to lose him again and that I wasn’t expecting a relationship with him, I just want to be there for him.

I went truth crazy and did admit I still loved him and I don’t regret saying that. I also had to admit if he’s still messing with other girls/finding comfort in them then I couldn’t offer my support because I’m not in the place for that. 

At this point, he doesn’t want the influence of others to guide his decisions, he wants to do things his way alone. He’s willing to keep in touch but I suppose there’s no promises.

Anyways I’m fucked up over this. I really love this person even though they’re lost. I want to be with them when the time is right. I was always fighting for both of us to find our way. And now he’s finally doing it, I also want to be there when he gets it together. But Of course I’m leaving him alone now though because I have no choice. I realize I have to look after myself, but tbh I have no idea how to deal with this or how to keep my mind at ease. It’s like I’m starting all over again.",1753800096.0,2,6,addiction,addiction

1mcf7z2,I smoke everyday but I don't feel addicted,"Okay so I've struggeld with an addictive personality for a few years now. I am a diagnosed alcoholic (not severe atm), have tried various drugs and often indulge in harmful behaviour towards myself. 

I have recently ""rediscovered"" weed. Smoked it when I was 17, but didnt really enjoy it back then. I preferred alcohol in the following years as a drug of choice. But when I got the official diagnosis i started to not take my drinking behaviour as light-heartedly anymore. I realized all the damage it had done in my life, how horrible and depressive I felt each time i drank and that I have to stop. 

And after a few weeks sober oh wonder, I started to smoke. And in the span of a few days I started smoking every single day. And to be honest. I enjoy it. When I'm high I feel less anxious and depressed. I fall asleep way faster, which is a big pro point since I struggle with insomnia. And the best part: there is no hangover or horrible depressive comedown or episode afterwards. Friends keep making jokes like ""you need to smoke less"" for situations where e.g. I talk nonsense. My best friend, who ironically smokes every day too, keeps talking about how thats so unhealthy and that its not good to smoke daily. 

But to be honest... I weirdly dont feel that way at all... Like with alcohol or other substances I always knew how bad it was for me and that i needed to stop asap and try to stay sober. But with weed i don't even have this awareness at all. I enjoy it a lot atm so I dont see any point on why I can't smoke everyday. And I am not talking about negative effects for your lungs, cause I've abused way way way more harmful substances than just ""oh its bad for your lungs"".

1mc0mvi,Spirit of addiction,"Just a little of my background: 42 m

I started smoking cigarettes at age six, ( stealing from my parents, ashtray ducts ) 
All my family smoked, dad, mom, brothers, aunts, uncles etc 
Drank my first beer age seven 
Smoked first joint same age 
We got a dish tv around 7-8 and somehow got free nude channels, so I spent my adolescence years watching porn
There were perverts in my hood who further aided my young porn addiction, also did things to me I had somehow blocked out of my memory until later years they resurfaced 
Also I would sniff gas 
Things got better around 10-13 years old, I got some friends who didn’t do drugs and so I stopped for awhile (even though both my best friends dads had playboy mags stashed and one my friend mom had a dildo lol, but no substance abuse 
Well then at 14 ish my older brother pushed me into weed use and I loved it along with getting drunk every so often
Some years latter I started getting chances to try coke and acid (which I gladly tried and enjoyed) 
It was in my late teens to early 20s that I started getting hookups with meth and I had a uncle who was a pill head and he would get me to try ocy, methodone, Xanax etc 
But thankfully through the years weed and nicotine was my #1 and though I tried a lot of other drugs.
But my 20s I developed a bad addiction to pornography which nearly ruined my life and cost me my marriage 

In my mid 20s I went to church and on a Sunday morning I asked Jesus Christ to be my savior and forgive me of my sins, which was the best day of my life

As much as I chased after my addictions, the hunger to know more about my savior and his teachings were just as strong if not more so. I thought I was free once and for all, not so fast buddy.

After some time I noticed the old additions start to resurface and back to porn nicotine and weed I went. But this time it was different I was no longer alone in my struggle, for God was still with me telling me that he loves me even when I fall down but he will not leave me in the dust, no sir he picks me up every time dusts me off and tells me to try again.

So I said all that to say this: when we talk of addiction we always hear about the physical and mental aspects of it 
BUT rarely do we hear about the SPIRITUAL aspect of addiction 
God has showed me the reason addiction, no matter what the addiction is, it’s a spiritual binding of our spirit with not only the substance BUT the power of evil seducing spirits to build “ strongholds within us that can only be overcome by the power of God almighty. Yes there’s an untold reason why substances are so overpowering, overwhelming that we can’t break free it’s because the spirits that bind to us and refuse to let go.

1mc73ai,'Harmless' addictions,"Hi everyone,  
I am 31, Autistic+ADHD, Recovering from EDs, Porn addiction, as well as derealisation.  
I wanted to get some opinions on what i call small addictions.

i understand that any kind of adiction- be it as coomon as screen or sugar, or as specific as drugs etc are a form of avoiding the pain and a whole burning life underneath.

Most advice online around addiction, even some very reliable ones, talk about eating healthy, getting exercise etc. and yet i have noticed that I can easily get addicted to those things. For example if let's say i start eating mango, i would WAIT for the time the next day when i can have the mango- same goes for food in general. Even exercise - i can get addicted to that high and perhaps a health freak self image that helps me push daily in recovery. 

Another example is nature. Spending time in trees is healthiest by any measure and YET, it can be the place where i ESCAPE, thus calling it 'ESCAPE into nature'.

Now hypothetically, all of the above it is considered safe and healthy, so a question comes to mind, WHAT TO DO?! I mean why is my brain getting addicted to 'healthy'?!

My dad got sober in jail in the middle of 2024. He’s now over a year sober which I do believe, he’s making the best choices he’s ever made, but he doesn’t think anything is real still. He refers to it as “the simulation” and apparently believes he’s living in his own version of the Truman show. He thinks our entire town is paid actors, he thinks devastating things that happen to the people in his life aren’t real but something to I guess … test him ? 

I don’t know if he truly believes this, it’s hard to believe. When he was addicted he enjoyed causing chaos and bringing negative attention to himself. This year is the only year of my life I’ve known him sober. I sometimes find myself wondering if he says all these things to bring this attention back because since the start of his sobriety he’s been getting less attention as we’ve been proud of the progress he’s made and we aren’t pushing him to do anything anymore or only giving him positive attention.

I just want opinions of others who have been in similar situations. Should I be concerned he’s using again? Should I believe him? If so, how can I help? How can I stop myself from it frustrating me so much? Should I worry that it’s a manipulation tactic for attention?

only… my relationship was with my dealer, an addict as well, he was who first supplied me. i acted on my manic impulses (im bipolar) and ruined it, and he threatens to cut me off all the time now that i’m single.
only… my body begins to struggle halfway into my shift, i don’t have the will to hold conversation anymore with people (service industry), sometimes i make silly mistakes or forget what i’m doing, and i’m a compulsive shopper so the savings aren’t there.
only… my roommate just found out, and she wont kick me out as long as i show improvement. she feels betrayed.
i dont feel real anymore, im misunderstood and alone and so scared. ive heard what quitting does to a meth addict… i dont know if i can handle things getting any worse than this mentally (major depression and emotional blunting issues). but if i dont do it within my control, eventually ill be forced to. no medical insurance, so detox and rehab are out of the question. no familial support, the love of my life died to his addiction at 10 months sober in 2023 so no rock to do this for, i cant find a therapist willing to undertake all of my issues.
i think i bit off more than i can smoke here…

i am going to a meeting tomorrow— its aa, not sure how i feel about that. im not religious whatsoever and dont plan to rekindle that as i was a catholic growing up. i’m very shy and manic i dont know if its even a good idea…

god.. tips on how to get through the initial first few weeks sober? ive only tried once and relapsed 9 days in… should i take off of work? will i have to forfeit all the plans i have coming up? what if i dont want to stop actually… i cant just go looking for it, my city is huge…? i could try switching to blow, but where does that get me but sniffling all the time. any wise words, influential pieces, or info would be welcome right about now…",1753731137.0,4,12,addiction,addiction

Just 6 days ago I quit Kratom, the last substance that had a strong grip on me, after using it for 3 months to quit tramadol, which I abused alongside pregabalin and clonazepam for 5 years. 

I feel so strange, uncomfortable, alienated. I know things of this order will not happen overnight, but I just want to feel safe, to feel like everything’s going to be ok. I just feel despair and impotence. And the weird thing is that I've always had this feeling that I have what it takes to be very successful, it’s just that I have no idea where to start. 

A good place might be just by recognizing my effort, the dozens of times I could’ve used in the past month and I decided not to. The times I asked for help instead of causing more damage. We are, more than likely, stronger than we give ourselves credit for. ",1753755460.0,0,4,addiction,addiction

1mbykn3,Misunderstanding and Mis-blaming Addiction and Addicts,"While international and more-local merchants of the drug-abuse/addiction scourge must be targeted for long-overdue political action and criminal justice, Western pharmaceutical corporations have intentionally pushed their own very addictive and profitable opiate resulting in direct and indirect immense suffering and overdose death numbers for many years later and likely many more yet to come.

It indeed was a real ethical and moral crime, yet, likely due to their potent lobbyist influence on heavily-capitalistic Western governance, they got off relatively lightly and only through civil litigation. … Instead, drug addiction and addicts are misperceived by supposedly sober folk as being weak-willed and/or having committed the moral crime.

Decades ago, I, while always sympathetic, also looked down on those who had ‘allowed’ themselves to become addicted to hard drugs or alcohol. Although I’ve not been personally or familially affected by the opioid overdose crisis, I have suffered enough unrelenting PTSD symptoms to have known, enjoyed and appreciated the great release upon consuming alcohol or THC.

The unfortunate fact about self-medicating is that: the greater the induced euphoria or escape one attains from it, the more one wants to repeat the experience; and the more intolerable one finds their non-self-medicating reality, the more pleasurable that escape will likely be perceived. In other words: the greater one’s mental pain or trauma while not self-medicating, the greater the need for escape from one's reality — all the more addictive the euphoric escape-form will likely be.

In the book (*WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? Conversations on Trauma, Resilience and Healing*) he co-authored with Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Bruce D. Perry (M.D., Ph.D.) writes in regards to self-medicating trauma, substance abuse and addiction: 

*“... For people who are pretty well-regulated, whose basic needs have been met, who have other healthy forms of reward, taking a drug will have some impact, but the pull to come back and use again and again is not as powerful. It may be a pleasurable feeling, but you’re not necessarily going to become addicted. Addiction is complex. But I believe that many people who struggle with drug and alcohol abuse are actually trying to self-medicate due to their developmental histories of adversity and trauma.”* 

When substance abuse is due to past formidable mental trauma, the lasting solitarily-suffered turmoil can readily make each day an ordeal unless the traumatized mind is medicated. Not surprising, many chronically addicted people won’t miss this world if they never wake up.  

Regardless, societally neglecting, rejecting and therefore failing people struggling with crippling addiction should never be an acceptable or preferable political, economic or religious/morality option. They definitely should not be consciously or subconsciously perceived by sober society as somehow being disposable.

Too often the worth(lessness) of the substance abuser is measured basically by their ‘productivity’ or lack thereof. They may then begin perceiving themselves as worthless and accordingly live and self-medicate their daily lives more haphazardly. 

… Meantime, most of us self-medicate in some form or another (besides caffeine), albeit it’s more or less ‘under control’. And there are various forms of self-medicating, from the relatively mild to the dangerously extreme, that include non-intoxicant-consumption addictions, like pornography, chronic shopping/buying, gambling, or over-eating. 

With food, the vast majority of obese people who considerably over-eat likely do so to mask mental pain or even PTSD symptoms. I utilized that method myself during much of my pre-teen years and even later in life after ceasing my (ab)use of cannabis or alcohol for many years. I don’t take it lightly, but it’s possible that someday I could instead return to over-eating.",1753752743.0,1,2,addiction,addiction

1masoag,14 days sober from cocaine! Happy!,"I was in rehab for 9 months and 13 days. At 4 months I had a one-time dezlis. 4 months later I relapsed for almost 50 days and was able to stop only for 38 days when I relapsed again for almost 45 days.

My tool was to move to my dad's house, I asked him for help to go with him because in my house I couldn't handle the temptation...

I understand that my slip-ups were due to emotional downturns, but sustaining daily consumption was a combination of being out of work, being bored, having time and money to spare, and having no responsibilities.

The first days were difficult, my mind wanted to trick me by telling me to go back to my neighborhood because my dad didn't feel well, but I was able to resist.

I feel good, I'm back in the gym to train my strength, I'm back in judo training, I'm regaining my weight, I'm managing money, I don't have cravings, I'm looking for a job and I don't plan on going back to my old neighborhood for a while. 

I leave a photo of my habit tracker.

When I'm sober my life only works when I keep a paper record of my habits, when I write in my diary, when I keep my place clean and tidy, my clothes and shoes clean. 

Today, July 27, is my father's birthday and when I greeted him he told me that his best gift is to see me sober.

I live on the east coast while he lives in (or rather, is incarcerated in) the Midwest. I have no desire to visit him in person, and no money for that matter.

This is a longshot, but I'm hoping that *maybe* someone, somewhere on here has also come across a video I am searching for. I don't remember the name of it, but I know I saw it on YouTube.

The only thing I can point to is that it was an interview of a young female who was recovering from addiction. She had referred to ""The 3 C's"" that she had learned in treatment. She had black hair and wore dark makeup, but she came off as extremely kind and dedicated to her recovery. She also described the first time she used as being like getting a glass of ice cold water on a hot day after running a mile. It was a very inspirational video for more reasons than one. I wish I had more descriptors, but if anyone happens to know what I'm talking about I'd love to watch it again. Definitely one of my favorite recovery videos.",1753740169.0,1,2,addiction,addiction
1mbggcx,“Playing the tape forward” doesn’t work for me,"One thing you’re repeatedly told in addiction when craving is to “play the tape forward” to the consequences of your addiction, or play it back to the worst moments in active addiction.

I don’t find this useful. Often when I use it’s because I’m on self-destruct. I will use or I will self-harm, sometimes even want to end my life. So playing it forwards often almost seems appealing to me.

I can think about the horrific physical pain that using causes or that the inevitable would be death. Both of those things in the moment seem easier than the emotional pain I’m dealing with.

I find 12 step programmes hard because addiction to me doesn’t feel like my main issue.  To me my mental health feels like my main issue. I often seem to deteriorate more when engaging in 12 steps as it makes me feel worse about myself. People talk about the joy sobriety brings them but for me it unveils the trauma and dissatisfaction with life. I don’t really know how to get out of this.",1753709989.0,4,8,addiction,addiction

One time she found me drunk choking on my own vomit with blue lips, another time she gave me GHB and I blew out for 2 hours. She let me try meth and I really liked it, so she started hiding the pipe in the bathroom for me and gave me the look so I knew to go smoke. 
I did meth quite often for under a year, I was going down a bad path but I got a lot of help from a close friend. Every now and then (very rarely) I still have a bit of meth, but what’s really fucking up my life is the alcohol. I can’t stop drinking, I’ve been an alcoholic for 3 years now starting at 16. My partner and I get litres of 40% whiskey and drink it straight out of the bottle, and there’s never any left over. Sometimes we get 2 bottles in a night. Right now I have an empty 1.125L next to me on my bedside table and I’m covered in bruises. We have tried to quit many times with the help of our GP and have had some success, but as soon as the Valium plan ends we just go back to drinking. I’ve become cold, aggressive, careless, I don’t have a job, I don’t have any friends, I don’t have any hobbies. All I do is sit in bed all day waiting to numb myself. My partner works really hard and I don’t contribute enough, I hate myself for it. I love my mum so much, more than anything, but a part of me is disappointed in her.

I’m grateful for the psychedelics and the MDMA as they’ve helped me a lot, but if I wasn’t mentally ready for DMT at 15 things could’ve been really bad. And if I didn’t get help getting of meth I would’ve really been screwed. I was always told how lucky I was to get all the free drugs, and that I got them all because I was pretty. I used to take that as a compliment, but now it makes me feel a bit sick. I’m so confused, I don’t know how to do anything and I’m always getting distracted and disassociating. I worry that I had developmental issues due to the drugs, I probably did. I feel I was failed by people who were supposed to protect me, but now that I’m an adult I have to try and fix myself with no help.

He absolutely destroys my family’s lives. We’re living in squalor because he literally gets shit and piss and blood everywhere and won’t clean it up. We don’t sleep because he collapses constantly from injecting copious amounts of ketamine. I’m constantly on eggshells waiting for the next big blow up, where he gets aggressive and kicks off with everyone (I already have cptsd).

He pays for nothing and has been supported with food, bills, tobacco, everything, for years now. All so he can continue to spend his money on ketamine. And if we don’t provide it, he steals it. His son is looked after by his family, because he’s absolutely useless. He throws this back in our faces constantly, smirking and claiming no one does anything for him and he doesn’t see why he should have to pay for anything.

He nearly died of kidney sepsis due to ketamine use recently, and had to have nepheostomy bags fitted to bypass his bladder and help his kidneys drain because they’re fucked, and still, he does anything he can to continue. If we find the drugs, we flush them. He’s been told explicitly he can not have drugs in the house. So now he’s taking cocaine to stop himself from collapsing, and sneaking people in the house to help him hide the fact he’s on ket, so he won’t lose it. Or dividing it into lots of small bags and hiding them so we can’t flush it all. Anything but fucking respect my parents.

I’ve lost my career because of the effects of his addiction. He’s blackmailed me, and hit me in the last (before being an addict), and I genuinely despise him as a person, yet I’ve done nothing for years but try to support him.

I can’t move out because my parents are financially dependent on me, but as someone with severe mental health issues (adhd, ocd, autism, active suicidality) I’m no longer coping.
There will never come a point where they will kick him out.

He’s going to die anyway, and I know how this sounds, but I just really want him to die now. I’m sick to my stomach of my life being destroyed by him. I feel unhinged with it. I’m sick of his mental health and addiction being top priority for everyone. He has made it clear time and time again he doesn’t want to get help or get off the drugs.

He who deals or whatnot so i ended up hanging with him a lot and messing around. We’d drink and id do coke nothing much up until this one night. This was like almost 2 days ago. I’m kinda embarrassed how inevitable and stupid this was but i was at my lowest point so i hope you guys can understand. So we drank and i felt like i did too much coke to sleep and he told me a bit of oxy will help with the comedown so i could sleep and chill. He obv warned me to stop sniffing. Of course me being too drunk and coked out and dumb i drank more and sniffed more while he wasn’t aware because nothing felt enough. Bit time passes and i tell him some more oxy would help and he hesitates but gives me more. Keep in mind i was sniffing these and not digesting them so they hit quicker. So far i drank a lot and did almost a gram or more of coke i lost count in total i also sniffed around 45mg of oxy or more. I never did more than that in the past. So i start to feel really tired but euphoric and fuzzy but i also feel like i don’t feel it and i want to do more but as soon as i close my eyes to relax i completely fall asleep well that’s at least what i thought happened. I end up waking 
up to Vic in my face scared and panicking and crying l was just confused because to my understanding it felt like i just took a nap and woke up normally. Apparently he said i stopped breathing completely and he checked my pulse and he couldn’t feel it and that my lips turned blue. He said i wasn’t moving or reacting no matter how much he tried to wake me. I even peed myself while being out and had drool or stuff all over my mouth. He said he tried everything he could to giving me compressions and cpr. And that’s when i woke up. It’s so weird to me my mind can’t grasp how i almost died or did die for a bit. It felt like i just fell asleep normally. I didn’t feel anything no pain. I didn’t even notice i was dying it happened so quick. The only pain i felt was like after the drugs wore off and i felt all the pain in my chest from the compressions he gave me and just the pain from throwing up a lot the entire day after. It was just complete darkness like when i normally sleep no much difference i think even at some point i was fading out and starting to dream or see something but then it went away as i was waking up. I really just stopped breathing i mean i’m not surprised it’s the consequences of my actions but i’m still in shock how easily one can die like that and the fact if i was alone or he didn’t notice quick enough i could’ve been dead by now. After waking up i felt really dizzy and tired and he forced me to stay awake because i kept fading in and out consciousnesses again even tho i felt like i was falling asleep. I didn’t even go to the hospital for many reasons. I just feel bad for scaring him and just in shock that just happened and i have to just go on with my life as if that didn’t just happen.

1mb2ox2,Struggling with porn addiction and penis insecurity. How do I stop feeling ashamed of my body?,"19M here. I’ve been dealing with a lot of insecurity about my penis size for years, and I think a big part of it comes from watching porn from a young age.

For reference, I am 5 inches erect. In porn, guys are always huge, and it feels like that’s what’s expected. Over time, I started avoiding real intimacy because I was afraid of being judged or not measuring up. Porn became my escape, but now I feel kind of trapped in it. I use it to avoid real connection, and afterward, I just feel worse about myself.

It really fucks me up emotionally. I know that in response to concerns like these, people like to say stuff like ""size doesn't matter"" or ""what matters is the connection"" or ""you're average, it's fine"" but I can't for the life of me bring myself to believe that. I’m not currently in a relationship, nor have I ever had sex before, but even the *thought* of being intimate with someone makes me feel anxious and ashamed.

However as an addict i can say this: if your head is not fit to face this monstrous challenge by yourself ... Ask for help. It's never your fault. There is no shame in speaking up. You can rise your head now. Stop being a prisoner of a substance. None of us chose this fate, yet so many cannot see beyond it. Repeat to yourself: it's fine. I'm fine. It will be fine. Don't let your life fade away, even when you cannot see no light at the end of a tunnel. YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Writing this is still hard for me. But if it helps at least one person, it's all worth it.

I'm completely clean now for more than 3 years, but if i ever lost most of my ground and stopped caring again, i can definitely see myself popping again. since i identified that benzos are my cryptonite... I keep a good distance from them. I suggest you guys to do the same with your cryptonite. Anyway, this is the end of my rant. I hope at least one person will connect with that.

1mb4du3,One thing I wish I knew,"After 7 rehab attempts and a 90 day jail experience from my ( age 16-19 ) drug binges I learned a lot. Sobriety is a journey not a destination, first cliche, but at some point it has to be a routine and you have to do it every day, ( it gets easier ) Withdrawl is something that your destined to go through and you will want to relapse during it. This is why they say willpower isint enough. The best thing and only thing that helped me was planning out the detox while still high very thoroughly if I was at home, if I was at a facility then I was good, expect trying to always leave or run away around days 2 to 3. But if I stuck it out ( it got easier ) crying, screaming, 100% unsatisfactory hell was my meth and fentanyl detox. I felt I would be stuck in this feeling forever, panic, distress, impending doom, apart from everything physically wrong. I did end up feeling better after 2 weeks, traumatized and scared of the feelings, but ready to always get high again. I learned I will never “feel” the motivation and discipline. I learned I have to actully feel like crap for some portions of the day, but I also learned that o can feel extra good doing things I thought couldn’t ever bring me joy, and they will make you feel high again but it takes time. 

I wish I knew to stay in a routine, to create a routine, to do small little things throughout the day that make me whole or some part of me spiritually, mentally or physically. If I craved or thought of using I cleaned, I didint want to ever at first but now I can be disciplined enough. I end up always feeling good. 

Nights were the worst because all the cravings and stress of the day made me want to use, however sleeping and waking up the next day I was suprised at how different I felt, refreshed, dopamine surpluses from my brain being able to heal in sleep. So the saying of give it one more day is true, 

5 more minutes. If the craving or urge to use becomes so compulsive and stuck in your thoughts, put yourself on a 5 minute basis of forcing yourself to stay clean and look at it as a healing period where your body is craving because it’s repairing at that moment. 

It all passes

1mb339s,He wants to quit but doesn’t want the help?,"My partner has been tapering down from a high Tramadol (slow release) use. He’s gone from 4 x 150mg tablets a day to 1 x 150mg tablet, which is real progress. But he’s been cutting the tablet into 3 parts and taking it throughout the day to manage withdrawal — I’ve since learned that breaking slow-release Tramadol can actually be dangerous and reduce its safety and effectiveness.

He’s agreed to go with me today to the local drug and alcohol service, which is a huge step. But when I ask him directly if he wants help, he struggles to say yes. He says he wants to stop, but prefers the idea of doing it “on his own.” I think he’s ashamed, or maybe scared, or just struggling to admit that it’s beyond his control right now.

I’m trying to support him without pushing, but it’s hard. I can see that he’s in pain, and I want him to get the safest support. I don’t want to overstep, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags. Has anyone else been in this situation? Any advice?",1753665353.0,2,18,addiction,addiction

1maizvz,If I drink alcohol every other day (evening) will I develop a physical addiction?,"I know that this is obviously not healthy and I am in the process of seeking help for my substance abuse issues, I am just looking for someone to answer my question please

Lately I have been drinking anywhere from 5-10 units of alcohol (that's a rough estimate but let's just say it would qualify as binge drinking) every other day, usually starting early evening. Do I risk developing a physical addiction/dependency if I continue like this?

  
***Update (TW for opioid relapse):*** Well as I mentioned I was already planning to seek help for my substance abuse issues. If all goes according to plan, either this coming week or the following week I'll have a first appointment at a drug addiction recovery center.

Regardless if I have or will develop a physical dependency, **after a bit of reflection, I have realized that in any case I do have issues with alcohol at the moment** as I find myself craving it almost daily lately and I know from my past addictions that that is one of the major red flags/signals that you're headed for addiction. 

The unfortunate news is that because I was craving alcohol today but can't drink for several reasons but mostly because of my ""rule"" that I can only drink every other day (and I already drank last night), >!I ended up relapsing on tramadol instead!<, which is something I was addicted to last year. It had been nearly 3 months since I had taken it at all :( So I'm pretty pissed at myself. I'm just going to let myself drink for now because it's still better (less dangerous) than falling back into >!my tramadol addiction!<.

Half my side of the family struggled with addiction and ever since I was a kid id always try to chase whatever “high” I could get. That resulted in some horrible habits when I became an adult and had my freedom to try whatever substances I could get my hands on. 

While I am still fighting alcohol and making lots of progress I was wondering if there is any advice for things that might have helped you out if you know you are prone to addiction. I know my first step is never picking up a substance again because I physically cannot say no once I experience the highs. Is there anything you have found to somewhat “replace” the feelings? For example my small replacement right now is a cold diet coke anytime I get a craving to smoke or drink, it of course isnt the same feeling but the sugar and fizz hitting my mouth helps a lot.",1753647409.0,2,3,addiction,addiction

If you are taking SR just to get tolerance down significantly, does taking 100mg reduce tolerance more quickly than 25-50mg.

The science of full saturation of G protein bias as opposed to partial saturation would support this theory, but does anyone have anecdotes or real world experience to back up this claim?

Again this isn’t about resetting to 0 over 20+ days, it’s just getting tolerance 80-90% down.

1mazz7y,Hour 78 of 7oh (gas station percs) withdrawals.,"Hey guys, so this is my first time in this community. Just deleted all the drug ones. Basically I have a long history with addiction, going back since I was 14 (21 now). This is my first time in real withdrawal tho, aside from nicotine. Usually I would switch from upper to downer so I wasn’t establish a tolerance. But man, 7oh got me (mostly cuz it’s legal I feel like. I fucking hate plugs and their shenanigans) It took me about two weeks before I said fuck it and started taking them daily. It started off cheap like 5 dollars a day, but quickly graduated to 25-50 dollars a day. And towards the end I needed 3 packs. I lost sm weight (which my former eating disorder was happy about) but now all I want is my sleep and appetite. I’m certainly not in agony like 24-48 mark, and least I can sit in one place without my bones vibrating in my body. So thats something to be grateful about and I’m starting to feel like normal life is back on the horizon. It mostly just feels like the flue, but with tingly legs and the complete inability to sleep for more than an hour. Currently I’m chilling in my sober living housing. And I’m swinging between optimism and depression. I could take the subaxone my doctor prescribed, but part of me wants to see this out so I’ll never go back.

1mae1h3,Stuck in a cycle of high gabapentin and phenibut dosage,"I know I am playing with fire but I am currently stuck in a cycle of addiction to gabapentin and phenibut. I currently take 2700 mgs of gabapentin per day (prescribed) and between 8-12 grams of phenibut per day to feel normal with no anxiety and to stop myself from drinking. 

I am worried about stopping or running out in the future but see it as a form of harm reduction because I have abstained from heroin, alcohol, meth, crack, various research chemicals including RC benzos, and fentanyl using this combonation of gabapentiods. 

I still occasionally abuse high doses of propylhexadrine via benzedrex inhalers occasionally but am trying to cut that out of my life as well. 

I am currently in treatment for mental health and substance abuse but haven't been totally upfront about my phenibut use because I feel it is helping me and I will be judged for it. 

I know these dosages are high and have tried lower doses of phenibut but nothing below 4 grams in combination with 600mgs of gabapentin is effective for my anxiety but due to the unregulated nature of phenibut I don't truly know the purity of the phenibut I source. I have gone through withdrawals when I couldn't afford any or when I had an insurance issue and couldn't get gabapentin and it was pretty terrible so I do live in constant fear of that happening and it definitely woke me up to the fact that I am fully addicted to these chemicals. I am also worried about the negative physical health consequences. 

I'm feeling pretty trapped by it to be honest. I feel like I need them at these dosages daily to function and it's easily justifiable in my head because it has kept me away from street drugs. I guess I'm just posting this to vent really. Addiction is a mf. ",1753593126.0,4,3,addiction,addiction
1ma7p0s,A story of addictions,"He is a 49-year-old man.  
His whole life, he has always felt lonely, asocial, and melancholic—oversensitive. He could cry alone just from sadness.  
Still, he has friends, a family, and a good job. Life has had its ups and downs. He shows some symptoms of bipolar disorder and has a susceptibility to addictions.

Fifteen years ago, the asshole boyfriend he was living with dumped him.  
He couldn’t handle it. His heart was deeply broken. He swallowed a handful of pills in front of him and washed them down with alcohol.  
The next day, he woke up in a hospital. His father — who had spent much of his youth demeaning him—was sitting by his side.

The breakup hit him hard. That was when he discovered alcohol could be soothing, relaxing—it could make him forget the deep, aching void he had always felt inside.

And so, he started to drink.

A few years later, he fell in love with a man who used meth and cocaine.  
They saw each other every weekend for a year, mostly for sex and getting high.  
Then that man dumped him, too.  
And he had discovered something else: the combination of cocaine and sex brought an incredible rush of pleasure.

Alcohol was always the damn trigger.

On gay dating apps, many people were into chemsex — and he joined them.  
Though sometimes he felt miserable, even pitied those caught in addiction.  
Mostly, though, he pitied himself.

When he got drunk, he put himself in danger.  
He had a bike accident. He got punched in the face. He was robbed.

Eventually, he slowed down.  
He began seeing a therapist again and started taking antidepressants.  
Things are calming now.  
He’s giving himself time — to fight his addictions, to learn to recognize red flags, to reflect on what kind of pleasure can make him truly happy, without substances.

The void is still there.  
Life has no clear meaning.  
But brick by brick, he is building a wall around that void — because if he doesn’t, he knows he’ll fall into that never-ending abyss.

1maf38m,My partner (25M) is addicted to Tramadol and I (23F) feel like I’m at breaking point,"He used to have a weed addiction that he overcame(I dealt with him throughout and it was so tough on our relationship) but now he’s become dependent on Tramadol. I think it started when he was around 14 his mum would give him strong painkillers like Tramadol for footy injuries, and she still does. A couple of years ago he was prescribed them for an injury, but since then, it’s spiraled into a secret addiction.

He’s been hiding it from me all year. I’d find pills hidden, he’d quickly swallow things when I walked in, delete texts with his mum, and make excuses. She enables it. she gives him her own prescriptions or lets him collect them, and they meet up behind my back. They have this hidden relationship. She also constantly asks him for money, and he gives it even from our joint savings, which I’ve been the only one contributing to.

Eventually, I found pills again and he admitted he was taking time off work to deal with withdrawals. He kept taking sick days until he had no leave left and ended up resigning/ being fired nearly. He said he needed time to get clean. I supported him, but months later, I’ve just found out he’s still taking one a day. He says he was on 3–4 pills daily before, but I assumed he had stopped completely. He claims he’s still withdrawing and feels awful every day.

Meanwhile, I’ve been working full-time, covering all bills, cutting and budgeting to the max. I haven’t spent on anything unnecessary. only essentials. He’s not working or contributing, but still spends money like he is: takeaway, gambling, and random things he doesn’t need. I buy groceries and he’ll still get takeaway. Our savings are gone. When I bring it up, he blames his withdrawals, says spending is the only thing that gives him relief from how bad he feels.

Our intimacy is gone. I try to initiate, but he isn’t interested. No compliments, no affection. He blames the withdrawals again. I feel so guilty and sad, but also hurt and alone.

I’ve begged him to get help, see a GP or counselor, but he refuses. He says he’s too ashamed. I just want him to get better. I’ve tried to be understanding and supportive, but I’m exhausted emotionally and financially. I don’t want to give up on him, but I don’t know what else to do.

4. Spending a significantly large portion of their money on it. 
5. Physical health problems, like sore lungs from excessive smoking or emphysema issues. 
6. Not being able to remember any of your dreams. When you smoke weed, your dream recollection isn't even 100th of what it would be if you weren't smoking weed.  
7. Mental clarity issues. This is usually from excessive smoking and can absolutely be a temporary effect but usually isn't long term unless the abuse continues for some time. 
8. Struggling to maintain chores or other necessary activities. 
9. Having to have weed readily available for almost any event. 
10. Eyes are usually red on a regular basis ",1753542610.0,18,10,addiction,addiction
1mafiqa,Reddit please help!!!! What are 007s???,"An ex friend of mine told me hes highly addicted to these things called 007s (double O sevens). He would take anywhere from 7-15 a day, which is a lot with the effects he told me about. The head high is like cocaine, and the body high is like oxy. Relaxed body, crackhead mind type of high. He pulls out a lil baggie that perhaps has a brand on it, graphics. It doesn't come out a pill bottle and he has to get it from a plug of sorts. It also runs for as much as a hundred a fucking pill, and i have other friends who legit were buying it that way but then he recommended his ""guy"" to them and now they pay like 5 a pill. He spends as much as over a GRAND a month on ts. This sounds like literal drugs dude!!! He got my current friend addicted too and she is a recovering addict. I am too (not addicted to this shit) but ive been a year clean from my poisens of choice. Im so concerned about her since he said he got her hooked on those things. They seem to be an illicit substance that isnt totally legal or illegal either, apparently unfindable!! Please help, reddit. I need to know the effects and how broach this subject with her carefully if ever. Ts is heartbreaking for me knowing how hard it is to get clean 💔 if anyone out there knows wtf im talking about please reply and tell me what you guys know about it. 
Ps, one of the reasons hes an ex friend is because he offered me some knowing im a recovering addict as well then tried to play it off as a joke. Its taken his wallet, his girlfriend, and in active addiction he has been acting like a total addict, in turn losing me as a friend. So insensitive, and the fact that he'd get another recovering addict on this shit is even WORSE!!!!!",1753598598.0,1,5,addiction,addiction

1ma045k,Are we truly responsible for our addictions ?,"We hear this word all the time: ""Responsibility.""

Have you ever felt like you are not responsible for what's happening in your life?

Where does our responsibility begin, and where does it end?

Are we responsible for things like gambling, drug use, or alcoholism?

According to my faith and reflection, I am responsible for:

My mindset

My words

My actions

My focus

My hopes

My emotions and feelings

My reactions to other people’s actions and words

(Not their actions but my reaction to them.)

I am not responsible for:

Other people’s mindset

Their words

Their actions

Their focus

Their hopes

Their emotions and feelings

It’s tempting to carry everything, especially in relationships or family, but that’s not the path of truth. Each soul is accountable for itself.

What about the outcome of our actions?

What if I do everything ""right"" and things still go wrong?

The reality is:

We are not responsible for the outcome.

The result good or bad is in God’s hands.

We humans don’t even fully control our own bodies sometimes…

Let alone our fate, or how others respond.

So what can we do?

Focus on your responsibility.

Own your mindset. Watch your words.

Take conscious action.

Respond with wisdom.

And then leave the result to God.

Final thought:

You may not be responsible for your addiction,

BUT you are responsible to do EVERYTHING to END it.

Do YOUR best and don’t carry what was never yours.

Walk in truth and leave the outcome to the One who controls it all.",1753553360.0,5,54,addiction,addiction
1ma3c2a,Boyfriend gambling all of our money,"I will try to keep this as short as possible. I am making this post because I am simply so lost and I don't know what else to do. I'm desperate. 

For the past 5 years, my boyfriend has been gambling away all of our money. There are debts over debts, he was caught multiple times - yet nothing works. He went to therapy, he understands the ""mechanics"", but he just doesn't stop. 

Lately, our financial situation has been horrible. Most days we do not eat because there's simply no money left. I will say it is 100% my fault for not checking more often, but I trusted him. He promised he stopped, so I tried to believe it. It made no sense why we'd be in so much financial difficulty, but he kept saying he owed people - which is true, except not for the reasons I knew.

I do not know what to do. This is the man I have built almost a decade with, hoped to grow old with, made future plans with. I do not have experience with addictions, so I don't know what else to do. I tried being nice, I tried going with him for self-exclusion, I kept his money (he wanted to do this for me to ""gain the trust back"") for a few months and then I gave them back, because I thought he was worthy of trust. 

He is still doing it. Almost daily, and I don't know what else to do. I am so sorry if this post seems mean spirited or offensive, but I am really hurt and desperate. How do I even begin to stop this? What do I do? Is there a possibility of recovery?",1753561429.0,3,2,addiction,addiction
1m9xebb,Addicted husband,"My husband has been using cocaine for 7 years. In the past, he used to do it during the night and would come home the next morning. It used to happen more frequently — 2 to 3 times a week.
Now, I can say he uses it less often (once every two or three weeks), but now he doesn’t come home for up to 3 days. During those days, I feel like I’m losing my mind.

We have three sons — ages 19, 15, and 8 — which makes it even harder for me to continue this life without him.
He has taken medications in the past, but they didn’t help.
I’ve never left him — but now, I’m spiritually exhausted. I’m seriously thinking of leaving, even though my two older sons might not come with me.

What do you recommend? At this moment, he is actively using and I don’t know where he is.
I’m also afraid for his safety because the temperatures are 45°C (113°F). 🤷🏻‍♀️

1m9rk6a,Is casual cocaine use possible?,"I went to see my sister over the weekend and found out she had been using coke as a party drug. I think it’s one of her friends that had put her on to it. She usually goes out almost every night or is drinking daily so I’m honestly not sure how often she is doing this and I don’t know how to approach this. My family recently has been trying to help her with mental health as she’s always struggled with it her entire life and we just put her on meds. She will not allow my mom to come with her to the physiatrist as she is not a minor. She takes her adderall inconsistently and struggles with adhd and bpd. I grew up around people who struggled with addiction in high-school which turned me away from harder drugs and I’ve only dabbled in psychedelics as i know I have an addictive personality so I stay away from harder drugs, so I am not sure how harder drugs work so I don’t know what it’s like. Is it possible to casually do coke? How should I approach this as she is extremely sensitive and is prone to victimization. I head back to college soon and I’m just extremely worried about her. The friend I had met who I believe turned her to coke I told to fuck around and find out and that I care a lot about my sister which I know is childish but I didn’t know how to casually say something at the time. What should I do? 

Edit: Thankyal for the insight on this. I reached out to her and my brother to fully navigate the situation. It’s scary especially being the baby of family and not having that much insight in the world but I appreciate the information.",1753531198.0,12,34,addiction,addiction
1m9ytgw,Just got over what I hope was my last cocaine hangover.,"For some context: I’m F30 and I’ve had a history with coke. From 16 to 19, I used to do it on weekends. It was never a full-blown addiction or anything like that — just recreational use — but it did trigger anxiety and panic attacks in me.

Since then, I’ve managed to stay off it for long periods, but every now and then, I’d slip. That’s what happened this past Thursday. I was drinking and decided I wanted to use. Got home around 7am, slept a little, and spent the day in a full-blown comedown. Woke up feeling anxious, guilty, regretful, with fuzzy memories from the night before, couldn’t eat.

I told my girlfriend everything — and thank god she supported me, even though she was (rightfully) upset. By the start of the evening, I was finally feeling a bit better. I was calmer, managed to eat a proper meal, watched some TV until I passed out, and after 13 hours of sleep, I woke up feeling okay. Today I’m back to myself.

I want more than anything to never give in to those impulses again — especially because I actually live a pretty balanced life. Yeah, I drink a few beers to chill sometimes, but I’m responsible with work, I ride my bike every week, I exercise, I don’t eat too badly. I just need to kick this one thing that brings absolutely nothing good into my life.

And I hope the same for anyone else who’s fighting this battle. You’re not alone.",1753550160.0,4,2,addiction,addiction

Maybe it would happen the day after you relapsed, but you „couldn’t wait no more”, so I guess we’ll never know.

1m9al6y,Lost my father to addiction and now I’m losing my husband to the same thing,"I feel like I watched the whole life me and my husband built together crumbl. I moved across state with my husband for his work, shortly after moving here I lost my father to his battle with addiction. My mental health since then has declined even more, not only because I live far away from my family but my husband being an addict as well. My husband put me thru a lot at the beginning of our relationship and I learned that he was an addict. I have always loved my husband, even before we got together. He has always been my bestfriend but I never knew that part of him that he was struggling with. As I look back now, as much as I love my husband seeing what my parents went thru with my father being an addict I would have never initiated our relationship. I feel guilty for even feeling like that, but the hurt I went thru seeing my parents relationship changed something in me. My father wasn’t my bio dad but he was the stepdad who stepped up, even with his addiction he showed me what a real father should be. My husband knows this, he knows the mental battle I go thru as well dealing with my own issues. Now since my fathers death dealing with my husbands addiction has been so heavy in my chest in fear that I will lose him too. For the past several years I dealt with this battle alone, I never wanted to tell my mother because I knew it would break her heart to see me go thru the same things she was going thru. It wasn’t until last year I finally told her everything, and it was hard. My mother saw my father’s death right in-front of her and there was nothing she could do about it. She never wanted this for me, she loves my husband but she knows he’s not a bad person just because he’s an addict. This disease has put a toll on both our lives and watching my husband go towards the same path is killing me. I would catch him use a few times throughout the years but this year is different. Since 2025 started our relationship has gone down hill, my husband has become a person I don’t know and it continues to get worse. I thought he was in recovery, but I was wrong. I should have trusted my gut feeling to know something was wrong. During this time I have emotionally checked out, I have been so mentally drained from the lying and gaslighting and making me feel like I’m crazy for being upset about things. The hard part is also that my husband never treats me ugly, he wants to plan for things he wants to do things but having to repeat myself over and over again about things has me feeling checked out. I find myself being angry for everything over and over again because things don’t change, he doesn’t listen. It’s like he’s here but he’s not here. I am always stressing to make sure things are okay financially and we have been even with his mistakes that have cost us and that’s not even the drugs that’s just in bad financial decisions. I just barely discovered a few days ago that he has been using everyday for the last couple months and has been using since the new year. I have no idea about before that but I know he must of never stopped. When I questioned him and gas lit me and said he didn’t do anything, but confronting him with what I found on his phone his only issue was me going thru his phone. A side note: I honestly never go thru his phone, he thinks I do and he deletes everything but I only go thru it when I feel like something is really wrong. Our argument was bad, he feels as if he’s doing nothing wrong. It kills me to hear him say that knowing I will never see my father again. I have built up so much resentment I can’t find myself happy anymore and I stopped doing things for him because he can never do anything for me without a complaint or saying he will “do it later”. Now this has just drove me mad and I feel at a breaking point. I love my husband so much but I can’t see him lose himself infront of me like my father. I feel so lost with the life we built on lies. I kicked him out of the house, it had always been me to leave but not this time. I need time to think, and during this time I’ve been in mourning for the man I once knew. I don’t know what to do, I’ve ignored his calls and messages. I keep thinking in my head if something happens to him and the last conversation we have is us fighting has been so heavy on my mind because that is the guilt with what my mother lives with everyday. How am I supposed to go on and show how serious is am? To show him that this is his life without me? But at the same time it’s not benefiting him or me? He’s still going to go on a binge? He already spent more then $1000 for this month alone and he cashed out $500 the other day. He said he doesn’t plan on stopping and he’s not sorry. I don’t know this man anymore, and I miss my fucking husband. It kills me to see him pull up to our home and cry as I ignore him but I can’t let this story repeat for myself. I feel so lost and helpless, I’ve tried helping him. He takes medication and he hasn’t taken it, he goes to therapy but it hasn’t helped. I can do absolutely everything for this man but it never feels good enough. The hardest part of it all is he treats me good, but it’s not enough. It’s not enough to make up for the lies and the stress and the pain he’s causing me. I’m tired of being angry and I want my husband back.

After our daughter was born and they gave her pain meds she abused them and started to withdraw from taking those, witch led to a year or so of pain pill abuse with a family member helping her get them. In an attempt to get her off opiates that she used to self medicate for adhd she saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed adderall. When taken like she was supposed to it helped, but her addict personality led to her severely abusing her prescribed adderall.  She would take it all very quickly, while staying up for days at a time and buying more from local friends that also had scripts for adderall or vyvanse, and eventually back to opiated when she couldn’t get adderall. It came to a breaking point in our marriage, and she eventually went to see treatment to get clean. She turned to kratom as a way to stay off prescription meds, which seemed to help until she found the shots. That was about 3 and a half years ago and ever since she’s been taking them Somtimes 2-3 a day when she can make enough money for them. She hasn’t worked this entire time, suporting her habits by either door dashing, lying about daily Necessary things like feminine products, gas for her car, taking grocery money that I provide and using that money for kratom shots. I make okay money and I support the 3 of us (myself, my wife, and our daughter ) on a single income which is very tight. Shes lied for the last year about being off of them altogether although the manager of the local shop she frequents gave up the info that shes been buying them all along. I’m not sure what to do. I’ve made it clear I would keep powder in the house as much as she needs in order to stay off the extracts but the powder just won’t give her the high she’s looking for. She continues to spend sometimes 30-50 dollars a day on kratom shots and isn’t making much effort to get off of them. I’ve tried everything I can think to support her in getting off of them. She  won’t seek counseling or therapy or anything else saying it’s pointless they won’t help her. Idk what to do at this point. I’ve found an attorney and I’m considering starting the process of separation and divorce if she can’t stop taking them. It’s unhealthy, and financially crippling us. What else can I do to help her get off the extracts, or should I just call it what it is and start the process of separation?

1m9jf9j,Is it inconsiderate if I start smoking? TW: SH mention,"TW: SH mention (non-graphic)

So basically both of my parents, but especially my dad, have been smoking for decades, with my dad being a chainsmoker. He has quit and hasn't relapsed in a year or two after doctors saying he'll die if he doesn't stop. I have smoked and vaped before and didn't catch an addiction. I'd say around 5 disposable vapes and a pack of cigarette. I have other harmful addictions like SH that I actively try to quit, but I've been doing it for over 5 yrs so it's really hard. I've been going through really tough times after losing my 13 yr old cat about a month ago and have tried really hard to abstain from SH. Somehow, when I think of coping with grief I imagine my parents smoking like they used to and I crave that feeling too. It just seems like a less harmful (still pretty harmful tho) way of 'punishing' myself or just overall coping than SH.

I'm sorry if this comes off as rude but I just really need answers. My parents know I used to smoke before btw. I just don't want them to know again. Is it inconsiderate to them if I start now?

Thank you in advance.

1m8ytzf,Struggling with drugs,"I’m 17 and about 6 months ago I took Md after being peer pressured by a girl I had met up with, never done any kind of drug before this and ever since then my life has gone downhill so much. I have been taking various drugs such as Md, acid, shrooms, dmt, weed constantly because the feeling of being sober is so overwhelming and in a way painful. I knew it was beginning to get a problem as I’ve lost friends and generally feel disconnected from reality. It has been in a way bearable for most of the time I have been doing drugs as the drugs made me feel good in a way, but about a week ago my parents had checked my bank statements and asked why I was withdrawing so much money. I made up an excuse and they bought it but during the panic it had given me of them confronting me I had taken a large dose of md and ended up absolutely freaking out. I was laying on the bathroom floor crying holding my eyes opened because every time I closed them I could feel my consciousness begin to leave my body like I was going to die. Ever since that night no matter what drug I take I end up in the exact situation, panicked out of my mind convinced I am dying. Now I am stuck in this battle of either putting up with the pain of being sober or having to deal with the feeling of dying while on drugs and I am so desperately trying to avoid taking drugs because the way I feel when Im on them is so fucking fucked but no matter how hard I try I still end up giving in and taking them only to feel just as shit as when I’m sober and i genuinely don’t know what to do anymore ",1753449214.0,10,32,addiction,addiction

The beginning shows a woman in active addiction and then after 2 minutes it shows what she looks like after receiving help getting sober.




Felt compelled to share this just because the visual of her before and after is ... unbelievable, almost.



Then hearing her talk about all of the normal/typical life and every day human activities and experiences by describing how surprised she was to come to learn about herself that she enjoys such normal and basic things is really touching and relatable to hear.



I am unfamiliar with this channel and by reading the comments I guess it's a religious creator with religious followers who are affected by addiction. I'm not on that wavelength but I can definitely appreciate this ""miracle.""



She does say that she doesn't think anyone can ""do it on their own"" which I guess is *technically* true bc we all have someone in our lives, and often people seek medical or psychiatric help but I believe she's implying that she doesn't think it's possible to find the will alone to get sober and find the strength within to stay sober alone...

1m8opu8,Sick for life? Or is healing possible?,"Was an individual who suffered from severe addiction and emotional pain for over 15 years.  Desperately wanted peace and freedom.  This is why I started using in the first place, it gave me something I needed, relief from my trauma and deep emotional pain.  It worked at first, until it didn't and by then I was physiologically dependent.  Tried every drug on this planet, but opiates and alcohol almost killed me.  Almost went to prison for a long time.  Worked as addiction case manager and counselor for 5 years at non-profit and was the program coordinator of Oklahoma County Drug/DUI Court.   I was also a graduate of the program.  

Sincerely tried AA/NA and 10 rehabs over those years.  Nothing worked and ""I worked the program"". Why?  Because the paradigm is completely wrong.  Addiction is not a disease and a person can fully recover and heal.  I did.  I don't count days or subscribe to dogma created 100 years ago that hasn't self-reflected in that entire time.  This creates dangerous belief systems, and a one size fits all cookie-cutter approach for humans being who are unique and dynamic in infinite ways.   We are verbs, processes in motion - constantly unfolding.  Not static things made the same... ""push this button here, turn this knob this way, do these step, and walla!  We have recovery!"" 

 If we can't even perceive what addiction actually is... an attempt to solve a much deeper problem, a symptom of the problem... then we can't even treat it properly.   Neuroscience has proven the brain is plastic and can change.  No one is born an addict, no one walks through an ""addict fog"" and catches the disease, or transmits it from another person.  It is learned like all things mastered, repetition... the more severe the addiction, the deeper neural pathways we have carved out and the harder it becomes to heal and find lifelong healing.   

Traditional Recovery pathologizes the person, not the pain.  Science of the subconscious would say AA/NA is extremely harmful and creates belief systems that directly influence a persons behaviors and emotions.  “You’re an addict. You have character defects. You are powerless.” This creates an identity and asks the person to conform and relinquish their authentic self.  It reduces a human being to a label - forever broken, diseased, defective.  The truth is... you were never broken, just surviving.  You were conditioned and put on masks.  This can be undone in the same way you put on clothes and take them off.  You are not your clothes, you are much more.   

The traditional model doesn't understand trauma, doesn't teach nervous system regulation, and doesn't address subconscious programming.   AA/NA literally is programming the subconscious mind in a harmful way and programming people's identify.  If they don't conform it is no fault of the program, they are just ""constitutionally incapable of change"", have not hit their bottom, or didn't really work the program and listen to their sponsor.

The traditional model reinforces powerlessness.  The truth is once awareness is present, and you can witness the toxic programming, you become a powerful creator of your life.  

  
Traditional recovery feels very performative.  You ""work the steps,"" avoid triggers, attend meetings, and try not to relapse. There is little attention given to who you really are, what you feel, or how to live from your authentic self.  This stunts personal growth and psychological development.  

It's time we realize the individual suffering from addiction holds the power to heal within.  We tried to relieve our pain through external measures with drugs and alcohol, sex, people...  AA/NA is an external attempt, so it will never create lasting/authentic change.  You can't tell someone to change, intellectually and conceptually read rules and steps, they must discover the healing power within and embody it.  

I personally, for 15 years, watched newcomer after newcomer not make it.  It was the same members, the ""old timers"", who had traded one addiction for another external source... dogma and tradition, not Truth.  So, in its essence, the rooms of AA/NA are harm reduction.  Equivalent to being on suboxone or methadone for the rest of your life.  Yeah, you're sober, but true freedom, wholeness, and authenticity are never discovered.  This saddens me.  Even the research states less than 5% of people who enter these rooms have life-long recovery... we can do better.  Our culture and our planet deserve better than a broken system that refuses to take a deep look in the mirror and say, ""hmm, things keep getting worse every year, maybe we should rethink how we approach addiction?""  

AA/NA is not all bad and does help some, very few unfortunately.  It's a free resource, available in almost every small town, and can help bring awareness to a problem.  The community aspect is positive and I do believe their intentions are good, just terribly misguided.    

If you ever felt unheard or misunderstood in these rooms, rehab, therapy, etc... shoot me a message, would love to chat and hear ya.  You are all amazing, divine beings! ",1753414186.0,6,6,addiction,addiction

This is one of my first (and hopefully many) posts on Reddit, and I'm seeking refuge in a community that not only understands the complexity of our struggles but also values each member's contribution. I believe that by connecting with other beautifully flawed individuals, we can support one another in facing the demons that challenge our vulnerable spirits. 

I desire to connect with those who are recovered, in recovery, and especially those who are currently active or those who have overcome addiction but find themselves tempted to return to the instant but destructive peace of activating my ""demon mode"" backup. I emphasize the active addicts because, just a few years into my own recovery journey, I'm feeling a strong and overwhelming urge to use again for the first time since becoming clean in 2022 at age 20 (I'm nearly 24 now). I want to extend my hand to those still battling these challenges, as I know how isolating and difficult this journey can be, and I admire your strength and resilience. I'm hoping that by hearing others' current problems and sharing my own, we can mutually help each other in staying or getting clean.

1m8oflj,the paradox of a self aware addict.,"i've become desensitized to relapse.

years ago when i relapsed, it was the end of the world. i felt like shit, went back to meetings attended daily told on myself etc. but after awhile i just, stopped. its become easier and easier with each relapse to dive back in. like im just picking up where i left off. 

5 months ago, i overdosed. it had a late effect, i developed severe vertigo to the point of being hospitalized 3 times in one week, losing my job, being unable to drive and being in debt. this scared me into being 4 months sober. 

i was doing good, but then i fucked up. i relapsed on weed. then it became alcohol then cough medicine then alcohol again. i thought to myself, well, i jus wanna try alcohol just once. of course, its never just once. so now here i am, i want to drink every single night. i know weed would probably be a ""better"" alternative but i've just gotten so bored. and now when i get drunk, i crave more. more and more. 

i have a good job, health insurance and full time. very fulfilling. im terrified of losing it. but i know, im self aware enough anyways, i know i'm going back into the delusion that ""this time is different"". every time i find myself in this weird like, disassociatiive state of ""nothing counts"". in a way its like nothings real. or at least, i cant build up the reactions i had before. 

this just leaves me in an even worse place each time. like, i thought i could hide it before. but then the health effects kicked in and i couldnt hide it. my mom said it was nice to have me back when i was a month or two sober. and yet, i still relapsed. there is still a tinge of guilt there but sometimes its hard to tap into it. 

when will i have enough? i know at some point, there has to be a rock bottom. when i was at outpatient, they said something along the lines of ""you can hit rock bottom but still find the shovel"". the man then said when someone asked him about what happened to his sobriety, he replied ""i found the damn shovel."". 

maybe one day i'll forget where the shovel is. 

until now i guess i'll hit rock bottom, come back up to the surface for a bit then dig myself a hole again. 

or i can pray by some fucking miracle i'll stop before it gets to that point. 

who knows? 

i dont know if its the substances talking or if i've had to start disassociating to feel even remotely okay with myself. its most likely the latter, but it works in the meantime. until of course everything falls apart, and im left trying to piece back together my life telling myself ""never again"".

1m8n6so,I feel like I'm about to decend into hell,"Please forgive me if this is the wrong place to post this. I am 29 and all my life I have resisted the temptation of abusing (whatever they call it (they always make it sound so duragatory)) drugs, but for the first time ever, tonight, I decided to take a large dose of my medication (4x my daily dose). It is a benzo medication and I have been so good at taking it as prescribed), but I have been struggling with mental health for 7 years since I was sexually assaulted as a male and have subsequently been assaulted 4 more times since, and I've been mocked and ridiculed for it. I have PTSD from it. I have struggled with hating myself since the mocking began and have been told I deserve it or that I need to suck it up or that men cant be assaulted, and a few days ago, I had a meltdown and smashed a few bottles of soap in my bathroom and my parents said that doing so has stressed them out as much as being sexually assaulted stressed me out and that I should feel more compassion and be more considerate to them and what I did was abusive and I just feel like Im a terrible person and for the past 2 days I heavily contemplated ending my life, and 2 hours ago I was about to drive off in the night to god knows where, but I looked at my medication bottle, and I just quickly and randomly decided to take 4x the normal dose and right now I feel so good. I feel so much peace. Peace I haven't felt in years. A calmness, a lack of anxiety. My doctor has tried me on a lot of medications and none of them work or make my depression worse and I've exhausted all SSRIs and SNRIs and other various medications and I am not looking for, nor do I want medical advice. All I am saying is that I think I finally get it. After all of these years, being labeled the ""good grandson"", the ""good nephew"", being labled ""good"" for not doing drugs. I have been on and off the benzo medication and I have been on and off opioid medication for painful medical conditions that require surgery every 6-18 months and I always took my meds as prescribed, but tonight I did something I never did before and I'm terrified I just opened the gates of hell and am about to decend. Withdrawal already sucks a hell of a lot when taking these meds as prescribed (my great aunt believes you don't get withdrawal if you take it properly but thats not true at all), but after the hell my life has been over the past 7 or 8 years, I've finally given in. Tonight it was either end my life or take the pills. Ive called crisis lines before and they always judge me. My therapists have judged me. My psychiatrist and doctors judge me. I'm sick and tired of this judgement. Im sick and tired of being ""the favourite"" or ""the good child"". I don't feel like doing this anymore. I resisted for this long, and tbh, I am not surprised people get addicted to drugs and alcohol. Right now with the high I'm on, I'll be very honest, I wish I took it sooner. I don't know what this will mean for my future. All my life the advice has been ""say no to drugs"", or ""it isn't worth it"". Life doesn't feel ""worth it"" anymore. I've had enough. Therapy and meds don't work. I've been doing therapy and meds for 8 years and people just are so fricking judgmental and I can't take it anymore. I can't take the therapy anymore with how useless it's been. I can't take my parents nor their friend's judgement anymore with how I don't have a job and how they know people who have PTSD and have been sexually assaulted who live just fine. Overall, screw society. It's been horrible to people who are addicted to drugs. People who are hurting so much. People who would probably be dead if they didn't take their drug of ""choice"". It's not a choice. God I hate people... What do I do? Therapy has failed me, my ""support system"" is beyond exessive with judgement, all the addiction supports are for people already addicted to substances. I am not addicted yet, but my resistance is beginning to fail. As I said, and as I have labled this post: ""I feel like I am about to decend into hell."" Although honestly, I think I've already been in hell for a long time. I just haven't used substances to cope with being in hell yet. I have been in constant physical and psychological pain for years now and the medical system won't support me or provide any reliefe other than ""Practice mindfulness"" ""just breath"". Sure. I can do that. I can breath. I've been breathing for 29 years. Its what keeps my brain functioning. I've already sustained a brain injury from an accident, so I'm not particularly concerned about how drugs can cause brain damage. I've been clinically dead already. What difference does it make wether it be from a head trauma or from overdosing? At least overdosing feels good. I've technically been overdosed on pain meds, however it was in a post surgical setting where I was in so much agony that they gave me so much pain meds that my breathing became completely voluntary and they had to pat my face and tell me to breath ever 5-10 seconds for 4 hours before my pain was managed and I safely passed out. I don't know. I feel like I'm at a breaking point.

1m8r57o,how to help?,"Hi, I’m 16 and my dad is a severe addict. I came on here to sort of ask how to tackle his addiction and help him go on the right path. I understand you can’t save someone who doesn’t want to be saved , but there has to be a way to help? Since my dad was younger, from what I understand, was verbally abused, possibly physically, I can’t remember. But he had severe mental issues, so does my grandmother, such as OCD, depression, anxiety, BPD, and most likely any mental illness you could find. He’s been using probably my whole life. He had a terrible alcohol addiction when I was in 2nd grade, but then shifted back to drugs. It got significantly worse when I went into the 6th grade, so much so that I started to realize there was something was wrong with him. He was in and out of rehab and detox places, but was never completely sober. The longest he was sober was for around 8 months my 8th grade year, but relapsed again. He’s been homeless since then, and I’m going into the 11th grade. He’s created a whole persona in his “new life”, going by a new name, getting a tattoo of the city on his forearm, and surrounding himself with people that have no true respect for him. I see him all the time on the street, I’ll make eye contact with him, and he’ll walk away, either out of shame or respect for me not wanting to see him like that. My mom has spoken to him and he told her that he would get clean when his girlfriend gets clean, she’s on the verge of dying I’m pretty sure. My grandmother has even visited him and he said he would get clean the next day. Ever since I was little I was his favorite thing in the world, him seeing me in the rehabilitation places was his biggest motivation. I feel like if I spoke to him I could possibly lead him to the right path, and if not there’s a bunch I need to get off my chest. I think it’s just the savior complex in me. I forgot to mention that I have a younger brother, he’s 7. He has faint memory of our father, but he asks about him everyday. He asks where he is, how he’s doing, if he’s even alive, and every time I never know how to answer. I feel like i’m destroying myself while my father is destroying himself too. I know I’m just a kid, but there has to be something I could do? Is talking to him, even just for myself, the right thing? Is there a way to bring him back or is he too far gone? I don’t want him to die. ",1753422176.0,0,5,addiction,addiction

1m8iiwl,Nostalgic buzz,"Looong read

I M51) haven't had alcohol or weed in years. From late teens to early twenties, I was a weekend binge drinker. Plain old 5% beer. During the week I didn't drink and it never crossed my mind. If for some reason I did not go out on the weekend, then I didn't drink either. Once I stopped going out that was it, no more beer. In my early to mid twenties I tried some weed and fell in love. It was like an amplifier! Music was better, movies were better, it just felt amazing. I quit several times, usually for a few years and for various reasons. I got married about 20 years ago, and everything was great for the first 10 or so years. But after that it declined and I wasn't happy and neither was she, so I started weed again. And that snowballed to the point where I wanted to smoke whenever I had a chance. Drinking was very sporadic until I started hanging out with coworkers after work. I'm ashamed to admit I drove home with a blood alcohol level that was over the limit on more than one occasion. I got a divorce and started seeing someone else; neither went very well. I eventually stopped smoking weed but by doing so, I increased my alcohol intake. I guess I needed something. Beer, IPAs in the 5-8% range, or red wine were my go to. It ended my relationship, I bought a house, kept drinking and restarted weed, and before long work was starting to suffer. So I decided to seek help and have been clean ever since. Like I said I'm 51 now. I can't say I have cravings. Ice cream or pizza sure, weed or alcohol not really. But I so miss the occasions where I'm sitting on the porch with a beer or a a joint (well bowl usually). I thonk it's more the yhought of it than anything else. I know I can never have either again though and that sucks. I have stopped listening to a lot of music and stopped walking a lot of movies because they are just not as exiting withoud weed. I used to be a fervent gamer but apparently not without weed! Crazy really. I've been looking for an alternative to give me a light buzz. Nothing crazy, just enough to enjoy the porch again. I just don't know if something like that exists, or won't get me addicted again. I even thought about hypnotherapy. Not to get rid of these thoughts mind you, but to be able to control the amount I consume. Thanks for reading.",1753396674.0,2,1,addiction,addiction
1m8giin,Supporting someone spiraling in addiction/BPD - Is this the storm before recovery? How do I help without enabling?,"
Hi everyone,

I’m looking for clarity, perspective, and hope from people who’ve been through this.

Someone I care about (not a partner, but an ex that I managed to stay friends with) is going through what feels like a collapse. He has borderline personality disorder and is struggling with addiction. He recently relapsed for the first time ever on ketamine and cocaine. Prior to this he was an alcoholic that went to rehab for that. After trying to support him through treatment over the past month only to have him want help but then leave treatment AMA, I put up some boundaries and stopped engaging. I also refused to give him back his dog that I told him I’d watch while he was in rehab. Today, he texted me sad hopeless things like: 
	
“The meds just mess me up. I’m in a unique situation where the best meds don’t work for me. There’s only one left and I cannot take it. 

“Maybe drinking instead of using drugs is a win. harm reduction is good enough.”

“I’m dying, slowly but surely.”

“I need you to hate me.”


At the same time, he’s been isolating, sending concerning messages, and pulling away from people who care. But he also arranged for his sober coach to call me recently, and that call was calm, even thoughtful. It felt like he wanted someone to understand. Like he still wants help, even if he doesn’t know how to ask for it anymore.

I’m not his partner or family, but I’ve been holding a lot: caring for his dog, fielding emotional crises, and now trying to protect myself from getting overwhelmed. I’ve also been in touch with his dad, who’s trying to support him from afar and engaging with a lawyer to discuss possible guardianship (he’s a trust fund kid with unlimited access to money which makes this addiction cycle worse).

I’m torn between:

- Not wanting to abandon him
- Not wanting to co-sign his decline
- Wondering if this spiral is actually part of the path to something better?

So I guess I’m asking:

- Is this kind of collapse common before recovery? Do people get worse before they finally say “enough”?
- What does the beginning of true recovery look like and how can you tell the difference from false starts?
- What’s the most helpful thing someone like me can do? I’m not his partner, not his therapist just someone who cares a lot.

This is painful, confusing, and exhausting. I want to do the right thing, not the codependent thing. I want to hold space without holding the burden. I want to believe that recovery is still possible but I don’t know what that hope should even look like right now. And I’m scared and sad for him :(

If you’ve supported someone through addiction or BPD or Bi-Polar Disorder and watched them find their way eventually… I would be so grateful to hear what that looked like.

Thanks for listening.

1m85pk7,Is he ignoring me because he’s using drugs? HELP,"Last week he was being super caring with me, saying he wanted to change, etc. He even asked for help. But this week, he’s completely ignoring me every single day and telling me to stop calling. I asked if he’s on drugs again because I just want to understand the reason behind this change in his behavior, or if I did something for him to suddenly treat me like this.
Is this normal for an addict? Or is he just being narcissistic?
I’m so lost I don’t even know who he really is anymore. Is he the loving, caring person who wants help and wants to change, or is he this version that just disappears?

Keep in mind, two weeks ago he spent the entire week using drugs. He even called himself a junkie, and after that he came to ask for help. But what about now?

I don’t know how to deal with this. My birthday is soon and he knows it. This has triggered a huge wave of anxiety in me, and I’m angry at myself for feeling this way.

I don’t want to distance myself from him because I know I’m probably the one who supports and motivates him the most to stop, but at the same time, I don’t know how to handle this anymore. It’s been affecting me for a long time. All his friends are addicts, and even some of them don’t invite him places because, in their own words, “he only thinks about using drugs.”

1m8a977,I don’t know how to support my friend through addiction,"Hi, so I’d like to preface this with I have very limited knowledge on addiction, but I think my uni friend is.

I met E at uni this year, and honestly she’s incredible, smart, funny, pretty, and we talk for ages.
But she smokes, and not just cigarettes, the illegal stuff too.
And I’m fairly sure she does other things too.

I genuinely care about her, and I have tried bringing it up a bit, but whenever I tell her I’m worried about her, she says she is fine, and she enjoys it.
Perhaps that is true, but she’s slowly destroying her life, she doesn’t go to class, she doesn’t sleep, she lives in a not super clean environment,…

I also know she is sort of waiting for a « BIG » event to happen, she mentioned how her parents don’t care, how no one will ever do an intervention.

I don’t want to lose her, but I have no idea how to push her to.. if not stop, consider stopping ?
I don’t think she realises how terrible this all is for her, she only talks about how eye opening it is.

The problem is I am not knowledgeable about any of this stuff, I know a bit about the physical affects, very little on what it’s like on a mental aspect.

I guess my questions is 1) am I overthinking it?
2) can, and should I try to support her?
3) if I should, what are some ressources on addiction I can find that aren’t bigoted.

He invites me out to coffee etc but is self-aware enough not to invite me for anything later than noon because he'll be totally gone. 

This time I told him he's gotta be sober otherwise I'll just leave, because it's boring sitting across the table from someone who's so high he doesn't even know you're there. 

Is there something else I can do or say? I've told him I'll take him to a meeting if he wants, but obviously he just laughs it off.

I’m new here, I personally do not struggle with addiction but my partner does. He is addicted to meth, both smoking and injecting. I’m interested to hear from people in recovery - what was it for you that made you want to get sober? 
2 wonderful kids, a partner who has been supportive in every way possible and family who love and care. We have everything yet we have nothing. 2 years in active addiction (that I’m aware of), 10’s of thousands of dollars down the drain and I just can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. Every promise feels empty. I am on the brink of burning out, packing my things and moving home. I love this man with my whole heart and want nothing more than to keep our family together but I can’t live like this anymore.

1m8g2b5,Is reconciliation possible when someone has multiple additions?,"I've been with my husband for 8 years. I've always known that he smokes weed, but a couple years in, found out that he uses coke typically on the weekend. He usually drinks beers and smokes cigarettes while using coke, which worries me due to the dangerous combination and how coke nowadays can be mixed with fentanyl. It's very normalized in his work as a chef, so he's usually using with coworkers after work. All of his friends do drugs. 

He's been clean off and on, but the environment seems to really not help. This last attempt at sobriety, he told me he wanted to quit everything but the weed, which I felt somewhat ok with, but even his weed use seems based in dependency. He is very intolerable to be around when he isn't stoned and can frankly be a complete asshole. On top of the substances, which is mainly weed and coke, he also has a porn/sex addiction and when he's trying to get clean, he will increase the porn and masturbation to the point of chaffing and then become annoyed that I'm not interested in sex. When he tries to stop that, even using blocker apps, he then wants sex 3 times a day, which is a lot on me, and doesn't feel loving anyway, it simply feels like being used to quell someone's addiction/compulsion. He has also downloaded hookup apps though he claims he's never followed through on anything physical and had inappropriate relationships with coworkers but again, says nothing physical, that it's an extension of when he gets deep into the struggle with porn, these actions are the step up.

He recently relapsed  on coke and alcohol with a friend and when I confronted him, he lied/gaslighted, finally admitted after I said I would be ordering a drug test and then minimized it as not a big deal. After an hour, I go to talk to him after calming down from the disappointment and he's in our bedroom openly jerking off to porn with the door wide open. We have young children. I'm terrified of him exposing them to any of this. When I ask him why he would do that knowing that even if children are asleep, they could wake up, he says he didn't know why and he was just too fucked up to realize he didn't close the door.

The biggest difficulty is that he is a functional addict and I am a stay at home Mom with 5 kids basically no income so leaving feels so overwhelming (no support or family) and the times when he's clean and really working hard and attending therapy make me feel like we have hope. I've also never met a man personally who didn't have at least an addiction to porn. Before the relapse, he was clean for 6 months and in therapy. I don't want to end my marriage necessarily, but I'm tired of being put through this mess, and I don't want to raise children with an addict. I don't know how to take steps to separate when I can't afford childcare to get a sizable income. Please share any advice. If anyone has worked through this in their relationship, please also share. I often feel that even if he gets clean off of one thing, there will always be something else--like a spinning wheel of co-addictions. The resentment keeps getting deeper and feels so exhausting trying to be a supportive partner, but I also struggle with how much support to give considering ""in sickness and in health"" when I cannot fully discern just how serious his commitment to sobriety really is and how hard this fight is as a spouse. Working against generational trauma and all on both of our sides. We are the only people we know that are married and mainly only saw toxic relationships growing up.

1m8a58j,"has anyone seen the movie ""The Outrun""?","imo it's a marvellous movie! did anyone see it? what do you think of it and the way it depicts addiction?

it's telling the story of Rona (incredibly played by Saoirse Ronan), struggling with an alcohol addiction and her bumpy journey through recovery. The film is an honest portrayal of addiction and its destructiveness.

It also includes some common beliefs around addiction recovery à la *“once an addict, always an addict.”* In the movie, we see Rona go to AA meetings and share her struggles with a sober life. She misses the euphoria of drunkenness, is convinced that she ""can’t be happy sober."" 

Recovery is seen as a lengthy battle with your addicted self, something you have to bravely endure with strong willpower. Forcing yourself to not give in to the alluring craving for the addictive substance and its pleasures.

I was addicted myself for 7 years and managed to stay addiction-free for 10+ years now. I don't subscribe to the notion of ""once and addict, always an addict"". feels stigmatising. what do you think about it? maybe it's necessary to close any loophole of continuing to use, but I don't think we will stay addicts forever

I just wanted to share something super personal... Almost 8 years ago I often mutilated my legs, arms, lips... and I found a way to stop self-harm little by little. But let me be clear, it's my solution, it's subjective, it works for me, that doesn't mean it's good for everyone.

Actually… I’ve been a tattoo artist for a few years. And since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by tattoos, it was already a dream. But over time, I understood that it could also help me with something else...

I suffer a lot from dysphoria, from discomfort with my body, from very strong depression, and I often hate myself... I self-harmed and had attacks of dermathilomania where I made my whole body bleed or I found impurities, which I invented, and what I still haven't managed to resolve is that I eat my cheeks, lip, tongue all day long and I'm in my mouth every day. 
And one day I realized that if I got a tattoo I wouldn't want to scar myself or damage someone's work. I realized that I could never damage my tattoos again like I usually do. It’s like a promise I made to myself: my tattoos are sacred. Since then, I stopped.

Getting a tattoo helps me find myself, define myself, resemble the person I imagine in my head. It’s a way to regain some control over myself, especially with my mental disorders.

But I know that in society, having visible tattoos — especially on the face — is frowned upon. We are taken for delinquents, drug addicts... Me, I accumulate, I am tattooed and I am drugged, ok... But it is not the tattoo that does that. It's just style, like wearing jewelry, different clothes... It doesn't change who we are inside, nor our intelligence, nor our skills.

That was just my sharing. It’s my personal solution, it’s not perfect, it’s not made for everyone, but it saved me.

1m7r3hw,why be honest?,"why be honest with our loved ones if they are going to treat us shit and chastise us for it? i’m addicted to nitrous oxide. i am trying like hell to get clean. but im bipolar and dealing with a horrible mixed episode right now and it’s very damn hard. i still resolve to get sober. i know my boyfriend doesn’t like when i do nitrous, and for some reason, me not announcing to him everytime i use is perceived as a lie. so, i tell him i just relapsed. instead of support, im met with “fuck that, im not going to talk to you.” “i’m pissed and i don’t want to talk right now.”
i understand he cares for me, and i’ve been so terrified he’s going to leave because of my addiction. i don’t think he will, but it makes me not want to tell him these things. i keep having nightmares me abandons me. why would i tell you when i am actively using if i know im going to be ignored? and if that’s your response, why is me not announcing every time i use, seen as “lying”? that doesn’t make sense to me. 
i get why he’s mad, and that he has to have boundaries and that’s valid. and one of his boundaries is not wanting to talk to me or be around me if im using. it’s fair, i feel like i can’t really be mad at that. but it still hurts. i still am upset at it and i feel stupid for being offended too. im hurting, and it’s that easy for you to ignore me?
it just feels kind of fucked up to withhold communication as a punishment for my addiction. i’m sad and alone… that’s why i’m using tonight in the first place. i don’t want to make excuses, because this is a choice i made myself. but if ya can’t win either way what do you do? my sister shames me into hell too if im honest with her about my use, even though i’ve saved her life multiple times. why demand honesty, and then shame me for that very honesty you asked for? i am mad at myself. i wish i was sober but it’s so hard right now. i don’t wanna hurt anybody.

I assume, it’s affiliated with pica syndrome as well as auto-cannibalism, even though it’s not my own skin i’m consuming.

I’ve been taking around 60+ mg a day. Yesterday, I ran out and decided to wait it out. Then, came the withdrawals. I didn’t sleep one bit last night, and as today went on, my symptoms got worse, and fast. I was shaking so hard I could barely hold my phone, absolutely no appetite, nausea, aches. I’ve never experienced anything like this. I’ve decided that I for SURE want to quit, but I absolutely cannot stop cold turkey. I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice for how to safely and effectively taper off.

1m7k8so,Accusing people of ‘denial’ doesn’t help. Here’s what does.,"Nobody is truly ‘in denial’ about their substance use. People might lie about their drug/alcohol intake in order to avoid judgment or legal repercussions, but that’s not being ‘in denial’; they’re in touch with the reality of what/how much they use, and they’re lying about it. There’s a a difference between conscious deception and unconscious self-deception. 

When people have nothing to lose from acknowledging their drug use—if they won’t get judged or punished for their honesty—then they’ll be honest about it. People make honest posts about their substance use all the time right here on r/addiction. 

So what’s the deal with ‘denial’? The concept of ‘denial’ in addiction all about **delegitimizing a person’s self-assessment of their drug use**: If you assess their use as ‘problematic’ and they disagree with your assessment, we call that ‘denial’ even though it’s really a difference of opinion. 

A wife tells her husband he’s an ‘addict’ because he drinks and smokes weed every day. The husband doesn’t deny that he drinks and smokes weed; he just disagrees with his wife about how problematic it is. Maybe we’re inclined to side with his wife, because maybe (we think) she has very good reasons for saying it’s a problem. But agreeing with the wife doesn’t turn her opinion into a transcendental truth that *everyone* must agree with, otherwise they are ‘in denial.’ It doesn’t negate her husband’s right to view his drug use differently. 

I understand the impulse to slap the ‘denial’ label on a person who lost their job for showing up drunk, who says “I’m not an alcoholic” or “it’s not a problem.” It’s hard to build a bridge of understanding across such a great chasm of value differences. The idea that “keeping your job is more important than getting drunk” is so deeply ingrained in most of us that we treat it like an absolute truth. So, we assume that anybody who doesn’t share this value is out-of-touch with reality…’in denial.”

But here’s what works better than accusing them of ‘denial’: 

* Providing them with a safe space to be honest about their drug use. 
* Making a genuine effort to understand how *they* define problematic use. 
* Encouraging them to reflect on *their* values and priorities surrounding substance use. 

If we do all of the above, maybe they still won’t self-identify as an ‘alcoholic/addict’ or go to treatment. Maybe they’ll keep drinking the same as before, if they truly think it’s worth losing jobs over…and we have to accept that, because they have the right to live in accordance with their own values. We can only choose to distance ourselves from them if we can’t tolerate their lifestyle. 

Or, maybe they will decide for themselves (after some reflection) that the pleasure of intoxication wasn’t worth the pain of losing their job, and they’ll make different choices from now on. 

Regardless of the outcome, accusing the person of denial doesn’t help. It doesn’t make the ‘good’ outcome more likely. It doesn’t make the ‘bad’ outcome less likely. It’s really just a form of gaslighting. It’s arrogant. It’s dishonouring their perspective. It destroys rapport. That’s why the word ‘denial’ should stay out of our vocabulary when we’re talking about addiction. ",1753302445.0,5,3,addiction,addiction

1m7uofo,Unpleasant feeling after tying.,"I was addicted to amphetamine for a while, fortunately I quit (due to the fact that I was almost killed once), and have been sober for 3 years. (I smoke tobacco, but very rarely, alcohol - I don't like it at all and don't drink it).

Recently, a friend of mine used amphetamine to boost his performance, I talked him out of it, it didn't work (we've even had a little fight now and don't communicate much, but that's another story) so then I tried it again, you could say I broke down - and the backlash after the effect itself was terrible - I was completely depressed for a week, no less. I realized, that's it, phew, I DON'T WANT THIS ANYMORE. And I lost the desire to take it. I don't want to be depressed again after a couple of hours of dopamine elevation, it's stupid.

But I had a strange thing - a friend took it - and everything was fine with him and he quit - when the period of high loads fell - and I thought ""what the hell can someone use it so easily and get rid of it, and I had such problems with it."" And I realized a strange thing - I often want not to use such substances, but simply ""to have the opportunity to have them.""

1m743xh,I decided I am going to stop using cocaine... ever again,"I am 21F in NYC and in the last 2-3 month I started using cocaine first 1 in a blue moon and then 1-2 x a week now . I am a college student and have an internship this summer/have been fully functional but I am truly terriified about th*e WAY* I think about cocaine.

I worry about addiction but simultaneously compulsively think about it all week and when I go out even on a Tuesday to have a drink with girlfriends, I get so excited in the hours before to go out and snort coke seccretly in the bathroom without telling anyone.

I really want to stop. I am currently writing this in a come down at 5am on a Wed morning and I am seriously struggling. I have just told 2 friends I trust in excruciating detail about how scared I feel to become an addict... I am going to HATE that in the morning... I hate the comedown so so much it makes me regret everything and I feel so truly ashamed the next day until 2-3 days later I am craving it at my summer internship again.

I AM OTHERWISE SUCH A QUAINT UNSUSPECTING GIRL! I just somehow convince myself everybody does it and no one feels guilt about it and no one lets it get out of control / everyone else in Finance does it and is functioning perfectly...

I think I have a multitude of underlying depression/anxiety/ADHD problems that have caused me to become so ""obsessive"" so quickly. This has convinced me that I have deep issues. I hate the person I have become with this. I do not want to be perceived as a ""coke whore"" I want to be NOT that girl so so bad... so I have hid it to every extent possible but I feel so much shame the following day for acting so crazy the night before. I fear some people suspect it anyway.

Just tonight I went out with a group of girlfriends for a casual Tuesday drink and was secretly snorting coke in the bathroom. I LOVED IT :(

I also have a fresh Rhinoplasty 6 months out. I am such a moron??

I just threw my bag out of the window. I hate NYC so much sometimes because it is ALL around me.

I don't know if this qualifies for enough for addiction yet but I know the *WAY* i think about it and worry about it means I am certainly susceptible for this becoming out of control if I do not stop.

I am not the kind of person that can casually do anything I have realized.

PLEASE: PLEASE only leave encouraging comments that will affirm that I should not be doing cocaine and that it is not good for me and that I am able to stop (despite horror stories of years of addiction which almsot confirm that I will never be able to stop?). I haven't been a disciplined person and am super soft genuinely so I could never quit if I was so so addicted I fear. Cocaine may not be a big deal to some people but it is to me and this has become clear tonight for that reason. Please give me tips on how to stop this...

1m7n56v,Recent Psych Diagnosis during recovery,"Hey all, I am about 2 weeks sober now (relapse with alcohol/weed 2 weeks ago, longer sobriety with meth and opiates). 

After that relapse of drinking, I felt bad of course for resetting my date but then I started feeling good about the program. I was feeling optimistic and felt hopeful. All of a sudden, last Tuesday, depression hit me like I ran full speed into a brick wall. It was so bad I was really contemplating suicide but I was able to call my sponsor and message other friends. Prior to this I had made a psych appointment to go over medication options if needed. I was just depressed, angry, irritated and tired. I went over my history and recent events with her. She used the word bipolar but diagnosed me with a working diagnosis of unspecified mood disorder. I have ADHD as well. She gave me gabapentin and Lamotrigine. The lamotrigine really started to work immediately. I was somewhat lifted from that depressive pit and have been feeling great up until today. It's only 25mg for now until 2 weeks I switch to 50mg for 2 weeks and then follow up with her granted there's no major side effects before going to 100mg.

I guess I am just wondering about you guys' experience with co-morbidities (mental disorders) and addiction recovery. It's kind of like chicken or egg imo. Was this mood thing always there but being masked or made worse in a way by drugs/sexually acting out? Or did these behaviors bring it out/cause it? I have always struggled with depression, impulsivity (which is part of ADHD as well), feelings/periods of high energy but also anger, rage, irritability, etc. I know trauma that I have gone through in the last 5 years or so can also play a big role in mental disorders and addiction.

1m7e2il,How to quit tobacco?,"My father id 68 and has been a tobacco addict for as long as i remember. He had tried quitting once very strongly, for almost a year, and then once we went travelling and he saw tobacco he took it once and then he never quit it again, this was around 2 years ago

He was low key about it for very long, but he could find some traces in his pocket sometimes. My mother has scremed and shouted and tried to make a scene every other day, he says he'll quit but he never does 

Until a few months back he kept convincing me that there's no point in quitting anyway. His life will be sad and mkserable without tobacco and tobacco is what gives him hope to get through everyday. We're middle class, not super rich but can afford day to day living so its not like he's really having to do anything through the day. He just stays home all day, goes to the market, watches tiktok youtube all day and thats pretty much it

I was fine even when i knew he was having it when he went out but thought he'll quit. The thing is he doesnt see the reaoan to quit. He says generations before us used to have tobacco alright, it was never this big of a problem 

And even suppose say itll cause cancer he feels he'll go through it with more rsilience if he has tobacco. I dont know what to say or do. Say anything and he begins throwing a tantrum, throwing plates and screaming, and saying he'll kill himself, saying stupid rubbish things about people, about us. He says he has more experience and knows how to live his life. What do i even do? ",1753288484.0,1,2,addiction,addiction

At first I didn't like it much, I was scared of the feeling when i smoked too much but now I am used to it and it is amazing, when sober, i constantly feel ""shaky"" and like I am about to explode, also whatever happens, i cry, for things that no one would cry for, but when i smoke it's impossible for me to cry, same thing for cutting myself, i could never do that while i am high and i stopped doing that when i started smoking more.
It also made me loose a lot of memory. Some time ago a guy was rejecting me while we were smoking, i felt like crying but afer smoking some more it went away completely.

1m77owy,ExMethUserWithFamilyStillIntoIt,"Hey everybody....so i have been sober for 14 months now. I was a very heavy meth smoker for a decade.   I got in trouble with the law for the third time and decided to actually try being good so my kids didnt get taken and I didnt have to get all suicidal and stuff...anyways, im doing good...but some members of my family are not.  My older sister, her daughter, and my brother are all still heavily involved in using.  I try not to be judgemental about it, because well... I fear that they will detach from me.  I dont hang out with my niece, I occasionally see my brother, and my sister and I were very close....she gets her stuff from her daughter, and yes im aware that is disturbing.   I had hoped by hanging out with her and doing things together, she would use less and maybe try to get off of it.  Recently her husband, who is sober and has not dealt with addiction in people, found a bag in her possession.  She initially said she didnt know where it had came from (this the third time this has happened though. So he knows what's up) and then she tried to blame me!!--because she had been over cleaning my house while I was doing my 28 days jail for my drug charge from 2024.   Now I will admit that she could have found some empty baggies, lighters, and maybe even a pipe or two that had evaded my search a year ago...but she most definitely didnt find a baggy with anything more than a crumb in it, if that.  When I got caught, I was actually trying to get drugs, so why would I get drugs if I HAD drugs?   No doubt, it was merely an excuse since she knew her husband was aware that she had been cleaning at my place AND she wanted to cover for her daughter.  This happened a few weeks ago.  Im.....sad, hurt, and angry.  Her husband now talks to me, which she has told me to ""go f$%k him then"" which is a completely unhinged thing to say.  We both want her to get some help, but she refuses.  He is not perfect by any means, and he and I have butted heads plenty, but at the same time, he has given her a very nice lifestyle (brand new vehicles, she doesn't have to work a job, she has access to money, she can go get hair and nails and stuff done, they live in a mansion)...yet she isn't happy.  He makes comments to her sometimes about when she comes down and sleeps for days, and when he suspects she has been using.  Then they fight... she lies to him about it all the time.  It sucks to see because they WERE happy together before she started using with her daughter habitually.
I know that some of you will tell me to detach...that's so very hard though.  I dont want to abandon her.  I dont want to see her blow her life up over drugs.  He has said that if he divorces her, there will be no coming back (I believe him, when he cant fix something, he gets rid of it and this is the second marraige for both of them...HER daughter isn't ""his"" daughter)....
This is such an ironic position to be in.  Im a recovering addict, and now im a person who has to witness addiction from the outside, with someone im close to and whose life is becoming unmanageable...I never intended to be one of those ""goody two shoes"" people who people in active addiction refuse to be around...and who hold onto their sobriety like its a lifeline...but wow.

1m75k39,Is it me or is it the addiction?,"I'll keep it short. Something has been bothering me for a long time.

I've been addicted to benzodiazepines for years and went to rehab a few months ago. In the meantime I've been taking Escitalopram as an anti-depressant and 5-htp on the side as a serotonin booster. 

Lately I've been keeping my use as low as possible. I still take benzodiazepines daily but at the bare minimum. With that I also started taking only half of the anti-depressant as I felt it didn't do anything. 

Thing is, I feel like absolute sh*'t. No motivation to do anything at all. I take care of my cats and do what's most necessary but my anxiety keeps my from enjoying anything in life. I'm just surviving. And it's been months now, without change. 

My question to you and to myself is, what's causing this state of apathy/depression without any signs of change. Was I stupid to decrease my anti-depressant dose? Am I not 'healing' because I still take benzodiazepines (at 5% of what I took earlier)? Is it my inactivity that keeps me this low? Is it the 5-htp that I stopped? 

I am starting a new therapy in a bit but I need to get off benzodiazepines before that. My inability to take care of myself or my cats/family just stops me from going to absolute zero with the benzodiazepines. 

I don't expect an answer that will solve everything but I'm just at a loss. Relatively, I am doing great (drug wise) but I feel lower than ever. 

Any tips or answers are more than welcome. 

All the best. ",1753266261.0,1,3,addiction,addiction

1m7152t,IS MASTURBATING WITHOUT WATCHING PORN STILL A BAD THING?,"This is the question I was asked by someone in the unlust app community.These were his exact words : “Hey bro, Quick Question.I am not a porn addict, but I still end up masturbating 2-3 times a day by imagination.Would you still consider it an addiction??” 

Let’s be real:Masturbation is a natural part of human behavior. And when it’s done without porn, it removes a big part of what makes the habit problematic in the first place.

So… does that make it “good”?

Not necessarily.

It depends on why and how you’re doing it.

 1. If it’s for stress relief or boredom… Even without porn, it can still become a coping mechanism. If you’re constantly doing it to avoid emotions — like anxiety, loneliness, frustration, or boredom — then you’re not fixing the root problem.

You’re just *numbing it* in a “cleaner” way.

 2. If it’s for stress relief or boredom…Whether or not porn is involved, if you feel:

* Guilty afterward
* Drained of energy or motivation,
* Like you *have to do it* every day

Then it’s a sign you’ve lost control over it.

And anything that controls you more than you control it is worth questioning.

 3. But if it’s occasional, mindful, and not a crutch…Then no — it’s not “bad.”

In fact, some studies show that masturbation without porn and in moderation can:   

\-Improve sleep    

\- Relieve tension    

\- Help you learn about your bodySo the issue isn’t the act 

\- It’s the intention behind it.

Once you know your intention you will know whether it is good or bad…Talk Soon…",1753249311.0,0,6,addiction,addiction

1m6fc3e,How Do You Deal With Boredom in Soberity?,"Almost 3 years sober here. I used to smoke weed everyday, and sniff coke once a month or so. All in a 5 year period. I decided to stop and work on my physical health. I just stopped on my own. Cocaine wasn't a problem stopping but weed was a big crutch and I had a bit of trouble. But managed to stop as well.

I have been spending the entire time of my soberity finding ways to make my mundane daily tasks more fulfilling but it hasn't been working.

I have been eating the best I ever had in the last couple years. Lots of variety and nutrients in my diet. I am in the best shape I ever been. Taking suppliments, protein, etc. But eating just feels like a chore. Cooking, eating and cleaning up feels exhuasting.

I go to the gym multiple times a week, but I hate it. Its not fun and I legit tried every gym in my town because a lot of the people who go to these gyms irritate me. Headphones don't even help. I tried alternative modes of exercise like mountain biking, hiking in nature, jogging, anything independent that doesn't envolve team sports, which I could never enjoy since I was a child.

I have a very tight and regular sleeping schedule, I sleep around 7 hours a night. I go to bed the same time, very occasionally going to sleep earlier or later depending on what I have going on that day (weddings, family get togethers, vacations, etc) It doesn't give me any drive or motivation.

I do not have motivation to do anything recreational. Video games, various artistic outlits like painting, drawing, writing, music, photography, and even graphic design are just a short list of things I tried to have fun but failed after months of forcing myself to do those things. I just get bored and give up after a few weeks to months of trying.

I have no friends. I cut out a lot of people because they were all triggers and used drugs very regularly. The sober people around my town are either extremely religious, ignorant, egotistical or very materialistic. I don't care to sit in a coffee shop talking smack about addicts or politics all evening.

I had many different jobs in a variety of fields but even the paycheck can not make me motivated to be dedicated and optimistic about my employment. I just go to pay the bills, like everyone, but I am to the point where un aliving sounds much better then being miserable 50 hours a week every year. I cannot go back to school where I owe student loans for a course I did years ago and currently persuing. That does not pay enough to pay off the loan anytime soon.

In my active addiction, I still had these problems but being stoned everyday and going out to sniff coke once a month or so helped me deal with it better. I got tired of it and got clean. Forcing myself to do these things sober is burning me out and as a result I am exhuasted and very irritable.

How do you guys deal with boredom while you are sober?

Psa: I am currently going to therapy and being medicated. Actually giving it my all because I am very determined to find joy in life. I have ""severe"" ADHD and CPTSD. Which I am apparently handling and coping with very well. Just tired of having to force myself to do things. Starting to not see the point.

I have never wanted to get the job any less than I do right now. Im terrified. I also feel like because its only been a few months theres no point in 'quitting', having an addiction for only half a year just seems stupid to me I guess, like do I deserve the resources or no? Ive used off and on a lot but I've never gone more than a year without stopping again, I think this is honestly the most hooked ive been ever though. 

I dont know, part of me really just wants to let it get a lot worse before I actually try to fix it since right now it doesnt seem horrible.

I'm stuck. When I first started again, I stole a disposable n some cigarettes from my mom. That's not a very reliable way to get it though since I always have to make sure she wont suspect me. Since then ive ran out of cigarettes and the vapes starting to run low, I dont know if I should just let it happen and run out or if I should just text one of my old friends from back then and see if she knows any places or people I can talk to who would sell to me. I'm not involved in those groups anymore, I can barley tell any of my friends about it either since their concern would likely show in disdain. 

Ive also considered just upping my weed usage to deal with it but I dont want to get a lot more addicted to that either. My access to weed is a lot better than nicotine, I know thats also not good and im hoping in the future I won't be hooked on that either but in my head it feels a bit less harmful (esp since the signs are so obvious, could only smoke at night)

I'm an immediate family member of someone in my household who was in detox for about a week. The first night, we got a 15-minute phone call from him and the tech (including the front desk and operations) stating that we are allowed said phone calls once a day. As a worried family member, I waited and waited and waited for a phone call because he'd said he'd call (this is unusual, and he is a man of his word always, even in crisis.). Phone calls were either cut short or we didn't receive a phone call at all. We had to call the front desk for updates after being promised updates if he did not choose to call. After about a week, I finally got a call on my personal phone from the family member who is transferring to PHP at a different facility (he was allowed on his phone during the ride, surprisingly). He said he tried getting in contact with us several times, but there was either no tech in sight or they just shut down the phone call operation entirely. He had stated there was inconsistent communication between staff, and it was so chaotic that operations such as a simple phone call couldn't even be followed through. He said he missed us and really wanted those 15 minutes, as did we. It makes me wonder what other things were happening in there. We probably got like, 4 calls out of those 10 days, 2 of them only being 5 minutes. We literally heard people banging on the door and he was like ""okay, okay I gotta go there's a line"" like its a prison. I tried clarifying with one of the techs on the phone at the front desk and they assured me that they take them into a room one-by-one and that did not happen, however we literally heard people shouting and banging on the door to get on the phone.

Recently he told me he resents me and that I'm free to leave if I want to and he'll ""figure it out somehow"". He's always finding something to say negative to me - even if I've done nothing to upset him. It can be as small as your breath stinks but a day doesn't go by where he won't find something. He never thanks me for taking on more. He has apologized for his actions but is otherwise defensive and has accused me of throwing his addiction in his face. We barely kiss unless I ask. 

Is this normal behavior to your partner if they are the ones holding you accountable for your addiction? Do addicts ever appreciate the person who stuck by them or is this over?  Do couples honestly recover from addition and betrayal? I do not want to be a single mom but is this environment healthy for kids? Assuming he sticks to recovery is there a point where an addict actually makes amends? How do you hold someone accountable who is defensive and resents you?

For context: I don't resent him, I'm really disappointed in his actions. I have fallen out of love with him and his continued actions are starting to make me lose respect. I'm giving birth in two weeks and we are locked in a lease until next year so it's unrealistic to break it. We live in a HCOL state, so going on my own would be hard but not impossible. I've cut him off from access to our joint bank account and limited his spending on the cc. He's promised to pay everything back in the fall when he gets stocks options. He makes over six figures and if he wasn't gambling all his money away would contribute more. ",1753182243.0,3,2,addiction,addiction

1m6gakf,Is this the end of the road for my drinking?,"I’m a 29 year old man from the UK.

I started drinking regularly at 18 like most people in the UK. 

To begin with I was purely a weekend drinker. Drinking on a Friday or Saturday. Then it progressed to drinking Friday and Saturday with the odd Sunday thrown in.

Once Covid came, although I was drinking less as I wasn’t going out on my usual Weekend benders, I started to drink during the weekdays. 

This trend followed me after Covid was finished and the last 2 years I have been drinking most days of the week. I would drink around 3-5 pints of beer most days and then would have a big drink on a Friday and Saturday, drinking till blackout most of the time. I might have one or two days off drinking a week, but this is usually after my weekend bender when I am too ill from the effects of alcohol to continue, and spend these days in recovery mode.

A lot of my drinking is still social as I will go out to pubs and bars at the weekend with friends and sometimes during the weekdays. But sometimes I am going to the pub on my own during the weekdays to drink and in the hope to meet other people.  I do occasionally drink at home on my own when feeling low or depressed.

My biggest problem is once I have drank a certain amount, I have no off button, I keep drinking till it’s home time or I’m black out.

Drinking has brought about many good times for me and is a key component in my social life and how I socialise, but I feel it’s taking a grip on me and I’m not in control anymore. It’s has also caused me to do many things I regret doing and caused harm to myself.

I have injured myself many times whilst drinking and I’m lucky to be alive to be honest, after one time fracturing my skull, as well as numerous other smaller injuries on separate occasions. I have also engaged in drug taking and sexually promiscuous behaviour.

I’m currently not working since my skull injury which was just over a year ago. I have no complications now from the injury and can go back to work if I choose to. 

However in the lead up to my injury I wasn’t enjoying the job I was doing and was very depressed. But I am also thinking my lack of purpose from not working might be enabling my drinking to the extent it’s at.

My parents have expressed concern numerous times for my drinking.

I am writing this after another weekend bender, I drank Thursday through to Sunday last week, blacking out Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 

I spent all day yesterday sick in bed and I’m sick in bed again today.

I had been told 3/4 years ago I had signs of fatty liver, whenever I’ve had a big drinking session now I feel so ill for days and I’m constantly vomiting and can’t eat, and getting dull pains where my liver is. 

How do I know if I am having withdrawals? as after any big drinking session I have now, I am sick for days, can’t sleep, having panic attacks, vomiting etc

I feel at the end of my tether with it all and don’t know where to turn. 

Do I need to stop drinking all together? 
Is moderation an option?
I’ve tried periods of sobriety before for 90 days, is another period of sobriety to get me back to some normality a good idea?

Sorry for the long post. I’m just looking for help and I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this

1m6lvcq,“Most people grow out of addiction without any treatment” — Yeah right!,"The claim that “most people grow out of addiction without treatment” doesn’t apply to *real* addicts. 

Sure, it’s supported by huge studies involving large, nationally-representative datasets. But here’s the problem…The researchers defined ‘addict’ according to DSM-IV criteria for Substance Use Disorder, and meeting DSM-IV criteria for SUD doesn’t make you a *real* addict:

Experiencing tolerance, withdrawal, using more than intended, unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use, spending a lot of time obtaining, using, or recovering from the substance, giving up activities because of use, continued use despite physical or psychological problems caused or worsened by the substance…

Does this sound like *real* addiction to you?

Here’s the truth: Being a *real* addict is all about how you recover. If you go to rehab and Twelve Step meetings and spend the rest of your life “working your recovery,” then you’re a real addict. That’s *real* addiction. 

If you only drank excessively, repeatedly blew all your money on crack, got hospitalized for overdoses, went to detox, developed drug-induced psychosis and went to the psych ward before growing out of your addiction *without* going to rehab or Twelve Step meetings…I’m sorry, you’ve never experienced *real* addiction.

1m6fj15,Caught Between Heartbreak and Hope,"I \[F27\] have been in a relationship with my partner \[M38\] for the past two and a half years. We moved in together eight months ago. Three months back, I discovered that he is a recovering porn addict and had gone to rehab for it a few years ago. I also found out that this was the main reason behind his divorce five years ago, something he never disclosed to me.

I'm living alone in a foreign country, and the thought of making him my only emotional anchor now deeply worries me. After learning the truth, my friends have withdrawn their support for the relationship because of his lies and how deceitful he has been.

I’ve tried breaking up with him multiple times. I’ve even moved out, but I keep going back. Every time I try to end things, I spiral. I can’t sleep, I cry constantly, and I'm overwhelmed with anxiety. The thought of never seeing him again feels unbearable.

I come from a difficult background. I had an abusive father, and my first boyfriend, with whom I was for five years until I was 18, left me. Since then, I dated casually but never entered a serious relationship. This relationship has been my first true one as an adult, and I gave it everything.

I know he’s betrayed me. I know he has serious mental health struggles. But despite that, I still love him. Sometimes I feel intense anger toward him, but more often, I’m consumed by sadness over losing the person I loved so deeply.

I feel stuck. I love him, but I’m scared of what our future together might hold. And yet, I can't seem to leave him, not truly. I think I might be addicted to him, because for the first time in my life, someone made me feel safe, seen, and loved.

It’s not about fearing I’ll never find someone else. I do get attention, and know I could be with someone else. It’s that we were so good together, or at least it felt that way to me.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to do what’s right for myself and for everyone involved. But I just don’t want to let go of him. Forgetting him feels impossible, like letting go of a beautiful dream. And truthfully, that kind of loss feels more unbearable to me than death.",1753194400.0,1,2,addiction,addiction
1m6edi0,am I addicted or just bad at making choices,"I, 19F, am worried I’m an addict, but can’t tell if I’m overreacting bc older sister is an addict and I’m scared of ending up like her. 

At the beginning of high school I was prescribed a low dose of medication for my ADHD. I will be honest and say I don’t think I’ve ever taken it as prescribed. I mostly take it to study, but instead of taking it once in the morning every single day, I usually take it anywhere between two and three times a day during academically difficult times. I’ll use it to keep me up until 5-6 am and will then sleep til 10am and get back up and start all over. This normally goes on for between two and eight days, with higher doses towards the end due to the exhaustion. During finals season in both the fall and spring it got to the point where I thought I had overdosed due to the miserable heart palpitations and blurry vision that the dehydration and not eating bc of the med had caused. I couldn’t remember how much I had taken, but in hindsight I’m sure it was half of the amount needed to OD. During midterms I had to go to the hospital bc I thought I was having a heart attack. When I told my friend all of this he said it sounds like I have a problem. But I’m not sure. 

I’m always able to stop. Like when the exams or assignments are over I am always able to close the bottle and go to bed. I don’t actually like taking the med, when I’m on it I usually feel great. But I always remember it as really unpleasant. It makes me a horrible person during withdrawals or come downs or whatever. I’ve threatened more loved ones and done more violence than I can count honestly. Because of what my friend says, I tried some online quizzes and they all say I may be an addict. I read the whole is an addict by narcotics anonymous and they said an addict was anyone whose use negatively impacts their life. And while my use definitely has destroyed some relationships before, also my mental health for a couple periods, and isn’t great for my body, it has infinitely improved my school work. I’m a straight A student at an Ivy League school. There have been a couple of times where I’ve stolen more from family members when I needed more and personally I’m willing to take any stimulant. I’m on adderall but vyvanse and Ritalin are great too if it’s what’s available. I am always able to stop when I don’t need the pills anymore, I just also cannot imagine my life without them. I could stop if I wanted to but I need it for school. My friend said addiction is when you continue despite the negative consequences, and while that’s true, maybe I just value the upside of the pills over the downside. That doesn’t have to be addiction, it could just be warped priorities and a penchant for substance abuse and misuse. It’s more of a bad habit I’ve created than it is anything else right? Ive never done any of that stuff where I buy it off another person (if I’m honest I’d buy it from a classmate if I needed and knew how but it seems embarrassing so I haven’t ever.) My life does not revolve around acquiring it. 

I do suppose I would prefer if I didn’t have to take it. But wouldn’t that go for any necessary medication? Someone with cancer would prefer not to do chemo, but they do it anyway even though it’s literal poison for their bodies because to them the benefit of living outweighs the misery of the side effects. But you wouldn’t say they’re addicted. 

Should I be worried about my use? Should I “go to a meeting” or see someone about it? Or am I just paranoid because I don’t want to end up like my addict sister (who is clean now but not after destroying her body and entire life).",1753191585.0,0,3,addiction,addiction
1m6cyva,One last dance or not?🤔,"I have for the past years used speed while producing music, gaming with friends, being little more social and overall interested in doing different type of things. I have now been clean since March this year.

Just to be clear: I have produced music many years before trying any substances. I’ve got a bachelor’s in production and have for a long time been having a pretty huge potential. But to keep the story short:

I started with these substances first and foremost for self medicate as I always struggled hard in school, remembering things and doing different errands and even keeping track in conversations with others. I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and depression. I got prescribed Ritalin and cipralex (SSRI). Great! I could start working out more, could clean house efficiently but.. my interest for making music is completely gone, my desire to play video games gone as well.

Is this a result of me either scared to not being able to perform as well as when I was on speed, or have I killed my interest with overstimulation those years. «It cant be as exiting anymore as when speeded».

My last theory is that my brain is still recovering my overstimulated dopamine levels from speed. And it’s a shame because I don’t crave the speed necessarily, I miss that passion of my life hobby. I miss experiencing the sense of «wow damn this is good producing» and «how did I just make that?» That accomplishment and pride.

With that said, I will be taking a urine test to be able to continue with prescription of Ritalin. This will begin in 24 days. And here comes the little devil on my shoulder playing with the thought of doing a last dance with this, doing a session with music production and speed, just a minimal amount as a farewell before committing towards a healthy new life (where I also will quit nicotine)

I am moving outside the city to a place with so much nature I am planning to start building this healthier life. I know it’s best for me to avoid this last speed day, but is it a chance that this is not the worst thing to do? I know that I can abstain from this if I truly want to. I am simply curious how much damage this could do..

I hope this text was somewhat understandable, and would love to get any sort of tips or insights :) Thanks",1753187902.0,1,6,addiction,addiction

I’m only a teen so I guess you could say I’ve got a lot of time ahead but I didn’t even expect to make it this far (thought I’d have successfully committed by now fr). I even convinced a family member to buy me pens so it’ll take a good minute before I’m out. I told her it helps with my depression and at the time I really thought it was helping- it made everything seem to bright and worth it. That was months ago. Since like June something or end of May I started smoking all the time after another failed attempt so I wouldn’t feel that shitty dissociation that the attempt left me feeling. For two weeks straight I was most high (only exceptions being a night of drinking and a night with a bunch of cough syrup/DXM). I tried to stop but lasting just 24hrs exactly before giving up. The longest since that was just a few days and only bc I physically couldn’t (was out of state and the pen I had stopped working). At this point if I don’t get high my suicidal thoughts come back and they always hit harder than the last since I avoid it like this. I don’t even like the feeling anymore- it’s just the only thing that keeps me from wanting to end it sometimes. I hate it. I used to rant to my friends nightly; all incoherent nonsense cause I’d been smoking. They won’t really respond anymore if I text too late and with too many spelling errors. Plus I’m in my schools band playing baritone so I need to have good lungs but like today on my first day of camp the breathing exercises had me coughing (and not anyone else). I know I can’t rely on it like I do but idk what else to do cause it’s so easy to find ways to die. Plus it keeps me from going back to s/h. What can I even do?

1m63u95,my friend didn't stay sober for me,"About 10 months ago, my friend Evie (19f) was getting mad at me for skipping school. At the time, I was 16 and in my junior year. I was planning to drop out because so many people were making fun of me for having autism. I was also skipping church to go sell my urine.

Evie struggles with addiction—back then, at 18, she had a really bad crack addiction. I’d been begging her to get sober for years, since I was 14. Eventually, we made a deal: she would get sober, and I would stop selling my urine and stay in school.

She’s been sober for 10 months now, and I kept my end of the deal too. So, we went out to a restaurant about a week ago to celebrate how far we had both come.

While we were hanging out, I could tell something was off with her. Her nose looked weird, and when I asked about it, she brushed it off. But I had a gut feeling—it looked like she’d been snorting something.

Later, we were cuddling on the couch, and I had her phone because I was scrolling through TikTok. I know I shouldn’t have, but I ended up snooping. That’s when I found out she had bought cocaine. It wasn’t like she was pressured at a party—she had actually reached out to the dealer herself.

I started crying and confronted her. She apologized and said she couldn’t help it, that she just really needed to do it again. It hurt because it felt like she broke her promise. I left and went home.

Three days later, I got a call that she had overdosed on coke. I’ve been crying ever since. We had a deal. I thought she was staying sober for me. And now I keep thinking—am I wrong for crying about this? Could I have done something to help her stay sober?",1753155737.0,2,11,addiction,addiction
1m5gnlh,"23F – Full-blown addicted to coke, had a seizure, and used in the ER bathroom. Where do I go from here?","Hi everyone. I’ve never posted something like this before, but I’m hoping someone out there will understand and maybe give me some advice or perspective.



I’m a 23-year-old woman and I’ve been in a full-on cocaine addiction spiral for the last few months. I started using occasionally, socially, at shows and parties, but it escalated faster than I ever thought possible. Over the past 2–3 months, I’ve been doing around 2 grams a day—sometimes more, sometimes less. I’m 105 lbs, barely eating, barely sleeping. Just coke, over and over.



About a week ago, I had a tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure that lasted over 5 minutes. I foamed at the mouth. Lost consciousness. It scared the hell out of my girlfriend and my mom. I still didn’t stop.



I went to the ER. And I did a bump in the bathroom. That’s how bad it got. I didn’t even know if I was dying, and I still couldn’t not use.



I’ve also:



* Had daily nosebleeds for the last few days—nonstop. My nasal passages are so inflamed I can’t breathe or smell.
* Gotten to the point where I literally sucked part of a tissue into my nasal cavity because I forgot it was shoved up there.
* Lost weight. My skin is breaking out. My head constantly hurts. I’m twitchy and can barely focus.
* Started having weird “zoned out” episodes—not quite seizures but like I go still and can’t move for 10–15 seconds, while being half-aware.
* Hid everything from my parents, but they’re starting to notice. My mom is so good and I live with her. I feel sick with shame.





I finally went to the ER last night again and told them everything. They were kind. They flushed my nose, gave me meds for inflammation, and talked about outpatient detox. I want to stop. I’m scared if I don’t, I’ll seize again. Or die. Or just lose everything.



I have a fake wedding in 2 weeks with my girlfriend—a fun, magical, silly event we’ve planned with our friends before she moves to Germany for school. I want to be clear, healthy, glowing for it. I want to show her that I’m capable of being someone she can trust, love, and come back to.



But I’ve relapsed before. Told myself “just one more weekend.” Lied to myself over and over. I’ve tried to taper. It never works. Coke takes the wheel and I lose myself.





So here’s what I’m asking:



* Has anyone here gotten out of a coke addiction *this bad*? How?
* How do you stop when it’s part of your identity, your nightlife, your escape, your highs?
* What helped you get through that first week? Did you do outpatient? NA? Detox? Cold turkey?
* What do you do when you feel like you’ve lost your community to this addiction, and have to rebuild from nothing?





Any experience, encouragement, even brutal honesty is welcome. I want to live. I want to heal. I want to love my life again.

I will start off by saying that I don’t condemn anyone who uses weed as I myself am a casual user of it but it’s definitely not a daily thing for me or anyone else in the household, however my sister in law is a daily heavy smoker. She is currently a stay at home mom to a two year old and has been since the baby is born, however she has a lot of help and people who are actively checking in. My parents regularly ask if she needs any help or if they can baby sit, I do as well and do often spend time watching the baby so she can have some time for herself to shower or run an errand. She also has a therapist and is taking some type of anti depression medication but it doesn’t seem like she’s really using therapy to its full extent. All that being said she smokes throughout the day starting anywhere from 7-9 am with several bong rips while she is home alone with the baby (never in front of the baby, she steps outside) and doesn’t stop taking an hourly smoke break until she goes to bed. She takes a 3-4 hour nap everyday and is incredibly irritable when she has to leave the house for a period of time. When asked about it she always has some excuse as to why she was smoking so much that day like “oh I’ve had a headache” “it’s been a hard and long day” “oh I’m having tummy problems” or “I might be getting sick and this is helping me eat.” It’s super clear to me that this isn’t normal and not healthy for her long term but I’m not sure if I’m out of line in thinking this is too much use or if it’s even my place to talk to her about it on a serious level, I really do care about her and want to see her get back to the person she was before the baby.

To cut a long story short, I’m addicted to codeine which I’m legitimately prescribed for pain reasons. I realised that it was taking so much from me about five years ago, and I have been fighting it since.

I’m currently day five, my body physically hurts, I’m achy all over and just feel like I’ve been beaten up. Mentally is the part I can’t seem to move on from. I’ll go three, six and even eight months clean but I always relapse. What can I do? It’s taking so much from me and giving me something that I can’t obtain without getting high. It numbs so much trauma and stress, and I feel like it’s the only thing that gives me that brief release from all that but for such a big sacrifice.

Any advice for a lonely addict who’s in a crappy place right now, I’m trying my best but it’s so hard.",1753116421.0,3,2,addiction,addiction
1m5alby,One year sober.,"I’m now over one year sober. I hit my one year this last Friday. I was really bad on Coke and other stimulants since I was around 18. I’m now 29. It’s possible for anyone who doubts it. The way I made it to a year might not be for everyone else. Some people need meetings daily, or some only need it weekly, and some not at all. I had to find that balance that works for me and felt right. I’m not saying all your dreams will come true with being sober, but I will tell you my life has improved drastically. I still face everyday struggles, but I’m doing it with a sober and clear mind. I’ve finally held this job down for almost a year now as well. Got this job a week after I left rehab. Things can get better if you truly work at it and want to change. It takes a lot of work, but all that work is worth it. My relationships with the ones closest to me have gotten a whole lot better. 
My journey to sobriety was a rough one, multiple relapses, lying like I didn’t have a problem, and so many other things. Take it one day at a time, sometimes an even a minute at a time. Change is possible. Thanks for reading my friends. ",1753075940.0,16,10,addiction,addiction

1m4uy1j,12 Steps = damaging for young people. Focus on life-building instead.,"I’ve heard AA described as a ‘last resort’ for people who’ve tried everything else…In reality, AA is the most culturally-popular ‘solution’ to addiction. It’s free and simple to recommend. It doesn’t require any special knowledge about addiction to say “go to a Meeting.” Look at any Reddit post where someone asks for help with an addiction, and see how far you have to scroll in the comments before you find “go to a Meeting.” 

You could be a 19-year-old who went a little overboard in your partying phase, got yourself into some trouble, and at the *first* sign of drug/alcohol-related problems in your life, you’ll be advised—by your family, your friends, your doctor, a stranger on Reddit—to “go to a Meeting.” 

When you go to the Meeting, nobody warns you that most people your age simply mature out of heavy drinking. You’ll be encouraged to adopt a lifelong “alcoholic” identity and to “keep coming back” forever. They’ll pat you on the back for starting so young. (This was my personal experience.)

Now you’re part of a group where *belonging is conditional on accepting disempowering beliefs about yourself.* If you say “I’m not powerless” or “I can overcome this and move on my life,” you face ostracism. You’ll be viewed as arrogant, in denial, and doomed to relapse…When in reality, you just have a sense of hope and self-efficacy. That’s not such a bad thing. 

Here’s my advice: If you’re a young person struggling with addiction, don’t go to Twelve Step meetings right away. You need to spend *less* time around ‘addicts’ and ‘alcoholics,’ *less* time ruminating about addiction & recovery, *more* time nurturing your other interests, passions, and goals.

* Develop relationships with non-addicts.
* Find something more productive to do with your time than talk about drugs, alcohol and powerlessness with 50-year-olds who fucked their lives up. 
* Don’t view yourself through the lens of your addiction. 
* Aspire to be something more than an “addict in recovery.” 

You can overcome your addiction…Not by focusing on your addiction, but by focusing on something more meaningful. If that fails—and statistically, it probably won’t; the overwhelming majority of young people grow out of addiction—then go join AA when you’re 50. It should be a last resort.

1m5lkgk,Levels of WD,"I’ve spent far too much time reading Reddit. Every addiction and treatment forum. So many varying thoughts on PWS, how much med to start on for those using meds to help with WD, how long after the last dose of your DOC before you can dose. Then WD symptoms. I must have different WD symptoms than some of you. I see people talking about being in WD 2 weeks or 2 months after coming off their DOC. There is no way if you still feel like Day 1 WD on day 10, I could make it. My first 24 hours cold turkey are miserable. the next 24-48 it slowly gets better. But the first 24 make you insane. Sweats, RLS, body locking up, craps, hot, cold, can’t sleep, sweaty, miserable and your skin is moving, time literally goes backwards. Those of you who say you have WD symptoms 2 weeks later, are you just talking about moody, tired and not 100%, no way you feel as bad on day 14 as day 1 do you. 

just not feeling 100% but getting much better is how I hope many of you mean. How long and what kind of severity are some of you in weeks later. Cold turkey, when I made it a week, I was good.",1753110816.0,2,1,addiction,addiction

1m5owtk,The stories we tell ourselves about addiction shape our experience of recovery.,"Here’s my boring “how I became an addict” story:

I started smoking marijuana in junior high. At 16, I spent some time living in youth shelters, where I was introduced to pills. I started taking stimulants, benzos, opiates. At 19, I ended up in jail for a crime I committed while intoxicated. In my jail cell, I started thinking: “I must be an addict.”

After six months, I was released from jail into a residential treatment program for men with substance abuse issues. I spent 9 or 10 months in this program. Upon exiting the program, I began attending AA. I put my trust in AA. I accepted their dogma. I accepted the fact that I was an addict, and I always would be. I ‘surrendered’ because I felt like shit about myself and had zero confidence in my own judgment. 

So, here’s what I came to believe: As an addict, I cannot simply choose to quit or cut back. Other people may be able to do that, but I’m not like other people; I have the disease of addiction, which physically alters my brain. Because I have this disease, taking drugs is my default, and *not* taking drugs requires tremendous effort. God help me, literally. I have to take it one day at a time, because for addicts like me, staying sober for 24 hours is an arduous task.

I spent so much time socializing with ‘addicts’ in Meetings, rehab & jail that smoking crack and meth became normalized to me. My attitude towards these drugs went from “I would never touch that shit” to “all my friends are doing it” and “this is part of the disease we share.” 

Around my mid-twenties, after 2 more stints in rehab, 1 trip to detox, 1 stay in the psych ward after a meth-related mental breakdown, I started questioning my beliefs about addiction.  I started thinking critically about the addiction narrative I had accepted & how that narrative was impacting my life. I saw how my beliefs about addiction were shaping my reality.

1m5ndpt,I think my boyfriend has an inappropriate addiction to AI and need guidance please,"I need advice:
I(F 37) have been with my boyfriend(M 40) for 4.5 years, have known each other for 10. He initiated the relationship & it was really great as far as similar interests/hobbies, sex, future goals, until May when he suddenly became distant by constantly being on his phone & hiding himself away from me like in the bathroom for several hours, pretending he’s still working when he wasn’t(he would sit at gas stations), up all hours of the night on his phone. He didn’t talk much to me, & when he did, he seemed just annoyed toward me & suddenly called me ""a lot"", nagging, smothering(which he’s never said that) when I’d just simply ask if everything was okay or tell him how I’ve been feeling, he didn’t touch me, he showed no interest in having sex. It was really concerning, & and when I expressed how I feel, he blew up & said he needs space from me. 

I didn’t understand this sudden need, but I gave him space, then he seemed even more distant, so out of desperation, I took his phone while he was on it, & found he not only had a bunch of very sexual AI chats, but bought a year subscription to the AI chat app. I saw the context of the fetish he was doing, & even though I was hurt by him lying & what he was doing with the AI, I researched to try to understand AI chats(I have 0 knowledge) & the fetish he seems to be partaking in with the AI. I thought well, let me offer to role play the fetish with him, then he won’t need the AI anymore. I explained to him how it made me feel & that his emotional connection to the AI was inappropriate(with just hearing the AI’s name he chatted with, he could remember what the chat was without looking at the content), he agreed & said he never used an AI chat before but deleted the app & won’t use it again, & agreed we need to communicate more & work on fixing us, then tried out the role play and had mind blowing sex. That was 6/17.

Since then, I’ve caught him 2 more times trying to hide himself using the AI chat app, once sexting it while next to me in bed after he could finish with sex(separate than before), & once when he was sitting in the bathroom for a long time, which his excuse was ""this time it’s not sexual"". I knew something was wrong again cause each time he went back to being distant again, so not only was he still lying to me, but wasn’t even trying to help fix the relationship.

Just this last weekend, I gave him space to figure out what he wanted as far as relationship with me & how he felt about me cause I was pretty exhausted emotionally from all this deceit. Saturday he decided to stay out all day & night, which was fine, but I got worried once midnight came cause he didn’t like check in with me once just to say he was safe & I honestly was worried something could have happened to him cause where we live nothing but bars are open & he doesn’t even drink. I called him & he said he was sitting in a parking lot thinking about us. He eventually came home & actually came to calmly talk to me, he said he didn’t get far in his feelings & what he wants, but then initiated sex with me & we ended up doing it. I guess I just wanted to be close to him.

Yesterday I caught him hiding in our bedroom for a 4th time on the AI chat, he tried to swipe up to minimize it & I took his phone & pulled it up. He immediately looked guilty & I asked if he was honestly doing this while out Saturday when he was supposed to be trying to figure us out & what he wants, & he said yes. Where do I go from here? We’re supposed to go on this big 2 week vacation in 10 days half way across the country. I really fell in love with this man, but who he has been is not the same person. He said he doesn’t know why he likes the app, maybe the fantasy part, but I told him if that’s all it is then why be so deceitful & distant to our relationship when using it? He didn’t have an answer.",1753114890.0,0,11,addiction,addiction
1m5drf2,I seem to be addicted to gaming (World of Warcraft) and I don't know how to approach it,"I had played World of Warcraft as a child and for some reason decided to give it a go again 8 months ago. It has been a lot of fun, but there were signs that my new ""hobby"" has turned into an addiction:

* I have 69 days played time over the past 8 months. That's right, that is equal to almost 7 hours EVERY day on average.
* I think about the game all the time, even when I am not gaming.
* I compulsively check my characters multiple times a day, even when I am not supposed to. (e.g. at work).
* Most other activities seem dull and unexciting. I was very much into salsa and now I barely visit two weekly classes.
* I game a lot during work hours (I work at home) and my performance is very mediocre.
* I occasionally get some forearm, wrist and palm pain.

So when I draw the line, I came to the realisation that I am addicted, but I often rationalise it as not being too bad. One of the reason why I find it so hard to stop is because of the feeling of lost progression. I've invested so much into my characters, so it feels that time will be wasted and my progress will be lost.

The other thing is that I genuinely feel fun playing, even though not all playtime would classify as much fun. And another rationalisation is that I don't feel the consequences of my gaming are terrible. I still get along with my girlfriend, I still go out with friends and I still do okay at work.

So my question is whether I should try to find a way to minimise game time (say to 10-14 hours per week) or that is unrealistic for such games and the proper approach would be to quit cold turkey?

1m5e6z1,I need help but I’m lost.,"Hi everyone. I’m 18 years old and I graduated high school this year, starting uni in fall as a psych major. I have a pretty bad substance abuse problem, and if don’t have my favorites I’ll resort to OTC meds and basically anything that can get me fucked up. My family is counting on me to be something great and to do well in school, but I’m FRYING my braincells constantly. Even thinking about what to type for this post makes my thoughts become scrambled. My mom has called me a deadbeat but this is even with her thinking I’m done using anything besides weed. Which is insane because weed doesn’t even do enough for me anymore. The euphoria and disassociation isint strong enough. 

Now, I feel like a lot of drug users have trauma/difficult childhoods and actually seem somewhat justified for turning to drugs to begin with. But not me. I have a loving family and basically had the perfect childhood. No real struggles honestly besides my own mental space. I have no trauma, no history of abuse, literally nothing. Yet the only thing I wanna do in life is get high. If it were up to me, I wouldn’t work, would rarely eat, would really get out of bed and just do insane drug combos all day to experience some sense of freedom. I get so high I can’t piss and just stare at myself wide eyed in the mirror while I’m hunched over and can barely walk straight, almost forgetting I exist. 

But…I don’t wanna end up this way. I’m scared I’ll end up homeless or dead with this mentality. And it fills me with guilt knowing that nothing should really be “wrong” with me. I feel depressed now than ever. But what’s my reason for feeling depressed? I don’t even truly know, but deep down it just feels like I’m too lazy to wanna do anything in life. I wanna just get high everyday and when I can’t I just get more depressed. I say I’m tired but I never have enough energy despite sleeping for hours on end. 

Yes, the first drug I ever tried was weed. But then it wasn’t good enough. Now after I’ve abused a drug enough it gets old and I end up wanting something stronger. I’ve never done super hard stuff like crystal, fent, h, etc. I told myself I wouldn’t either (but I’m not to sure now),  I feel like if I don’t get myself under control my life and all that I’ve been given has been wasted. I probably have mental health issues I need medication for, but I still don’t get why. I’m still under my parents insurance and I can’t really get a psychiatrist to check me out or therapy without their knowledge. I really don’t want my mom to know I’m still using stuff besides weed, she already was broken because of it and I promised I’m clean.

Anyways. I just really need some advice on where I should go from here to prevent a downward spiral. And I feel embarrassed posting this but sometimes I just feel really alone in my addiction. Like the only thing that matters is my next high. I can’t imagine a life where I’m sober, and I think that’s the thing that scares me the most. I often think I’m just a lost cause at this point. The worst thing of all though as I feel like a lot of my friends and family are just gonna hate me for what I’ve become and I’ll end up alone 😞

1m500hs,My little brother is getting fucked up on Klonopin everyday and I'm worried.,"

A lot of this started yesterday when I (30m) got a call from my aunt regarding my youngest brother (23m) who currently living with my grandpa(72M). She told me she was worried about him because my Grandpa had called her saying that my brother's behavior had been extremely erratic over the past few weeks but that most recently he was passed out on the floor of the bathroom and unresponsive for a few moments before he got up. He says that my brother barely goes to his job anymore and that he's often stumbling around and slurring his speech and clearly being very intoxicated.

My little brother does have a history of anxiety and mental illness related to being homeless a few years ago, and I knew that he did have a prescription for Klonopin from his psychiatrist, but this behavior made me feel that he must be getting more than what he's getting from his doctors. I asked my brother about this when I had him stay over last night because I was worried for him and he was extremely evasive with his answers.

 I was eventually able to find out that he had gotten 30 additional 0.5mg pills from my uncle (42m) about a week ago. I've had words with my uncle about this and made sure he never does that again but I'm still worried about my little brother. I know he was going through my room looking for something after I left for work because I found a few Klonopins on my floor that he must dropped though he  denied ever being in my room. 

I'm kinda freaking out about it to tell the truth. I feel like he's making awful decisions with a very addictive drug but if I confront him about this too much then he'll start avoiding me and the problem could get worse. ",1753045317.0,8,4,addiction,addiction

1m4h53u,Seeking advice:  Accidentally smoked meth 2 months ago and still can’t stop thinking about it am I overreacting?,"I’m 19 and about 2 months ago I hung out with this guy I was semi-friends with online (he’s mid-20s). It was our first time meeting in person, and he asked if I wanted to smoke hookah. I’ve done hookah a few times before, so I said sure. I don’t really do drugs (besides weed occasionally), so when he pulled out what looked like a normal bong I didn’t even question it.

We sat in his car smoking and talking. After just a few hits I noticed I was feeling really, really good, like stupidly happy, super talkative, and honestly kind of euphoric. He told me it was “hookah from his country” and said it just makes you feel nice. I didn’t know any better and just believed him. I kept hitting it while we talked, probably around 20 deep hits in total, and then out of nowhere he said he had to go do something and left me sitting in his car. It was like 3AM. Even in that state I thought it was weird, but I was feeling so good I didn’t really care.

For the next 12 hours I was insanely happy and also insanely horny. I ended up meeting some random guy on Grindr to hook up, which is already sorta weird for me because it had been over a year since I had done that. When I told him what happened, he was like, “yeah… that wasn’t hookah, that was Tina.” And he told me I should probably go home. I had no idea what Tina meant until I Googled it, and when I saw it meant meth, I weirdly wasn’t even that bothered because I still felt amazing at that point.

Then the comedown hit. I felt sick, sweaty, my heart was racing out of control, and I couldn’t eat or sleep. I literally didn’t sleep for 3 days. Every time I blew my nose it smelled like burnt plastic. I went to urgent care and got tested, and well you can guess the guy was right about what it was x

It’s been 2 months now and I can’t stop thinking about it. I crave that feeling every single day and have dreams about it at least every other night. I haven’t told my friends because it feels dumb I only did it once. People have real addictions and here I am obsessing over a one-time thing. But I don’t know how to get it out of my head.

I never talked to that guy again. Part of me feels like he was trying to get me hooked so he could sell to me or something. I also think it’s insane that he let me take so much without saying anything because apparently according to my limited research that many hits in a short time period is a big dose.

Is this normal after one use? Or am I just being dramatic. I wanted to report what he did to the police so he doesn’t do the same to others but I’ve been worried that I’d get in trouble even though I had no idea what he was giving me.",1752989861.0,70,56,addiction,addiction
1m4vyd1,My story !,"For obvious reasons, this post may be triggering to some please be cautious while reading. Don’t do anything I have done in the past, this is my story on how I recovered. It’s something I wrote a few nights ago.

People always say addicts can’t recover for other people - they have to do it for themselves. I believed this to be true while I was deep in my addiction, I believed because of that I’d never get sober. But it’s not. It’s not true in the slightest. I used daily for five years, I started at a very young age to cope with trauma I’d been going through. SA, grooming, abuse, name it and thats why I started. It was nothing crazy at first, just some of my older brother’s mushrooms - but I loved every moment I was on them. Later I’d steal his needles and heroin too. I eventually made friends with people who influenced me horribly. I began widening my horizons, trying new drugs left and right. It didn’t matter what it was, as long as it took away the pain. I took whatever was handed to me, no questions about what it was. A pill, a needle, a pipe - anything. Eventually I found my favourites. Coke, meth, molly, heroin, acid, ket and others I don’t actually remember the names of. I think they were fixes of a few things. We’d call them ‘Mutt pills’ (I’m unaware if anyone else has tried these?). I got into a serious longterm relationship a few months after I started. He didn’t do drugs, barely drank alcohol or smoked weed. We dated for a year. A year of me risking my life. Travelling to new cities with older men (most of them were actually nice and respectful), going out every night and every day, lying to my parents constantly. They believed it. To this day they don’t know. He dealt with my bullshit constantly. One night he brought up that he wanted to try heroin (i had a months long binge on it previously). I told him no, that I don’t want him starting anything I’ve done. “You’re only allowed to smoke weed and drink my love.” The exact words I had told him. Somehow, he got my dealers contact info. I asked his cousin (the only family member of either of ours that knew we were dating) if he knew. He didn’t. I told my boyfriend to stop, to throw it out or give it to me. He agreed but didn’t. A few days later he had fought with his parents, it was horrible. He was beaten and bruised. He told me he loved me, I told him I love and miss him. That was our last conversation. He purposely took too much. He wanted to pass like that. To feel how I felt for once, and for the last time. He did it while we were all asleep, asked his cousin to send me a paragraph. Neither of us woke up, when we had he was already gone. I got the message from his cousin, the paragraph and his condolences. He blocked me. He even blocked me on my boyfriend’s accounts. To some people this would be a wake up call to get sober, but it wasn’t for me. I was in the fifth grade (Canada) and grieving without being able to share my pain. No one had known we were together, or that I was using. I fell deeper into the hole and used for another 4 and a half years. Over 1700 days. I got into new relationships, continued going to school, graduated elementary, I did all of that without the first guy I’d ever loved. Eventually, I broke down after yet another overdose in grade 9. I told my friends about everything, told them why I used, why I couldn’t stop. It didn’t seem fair. I was the reason he had started, why would I stop now? He would never have gotten the chance. They helped me, they cleaned me up from my vomit and we all went to the next class we had. My mom obviously found out, I told her I smoked too much weed (I was on prescription pills I was ABSOLUTELY not allowed to smoke on). She was mad, but happy I was okay. Later that year I suffered from a purposeful overdose. Four bottles worth of prescription pills, most weren’t mine but a few were. I barely survived. I wouldn’t have if my friend didn’t call the ambulance. I went to the psych ward, fighting my withdrawals at 14 years old. They took it as something to do with the medication I took. I drank myself half to death the following summer, caused myself another purposeful overdose. I continued to drink everyday from the time I woke up to the time I passed out. Again, I continued to use for another year. My breaking point to get sober? I fist fought with my cousin. He called his mom and both her and my dad came to get me. I told him I was high on mushrooms, though that wasn’t the case. I had taken one and a half tabs of acid and smoked some meth. I came home, my little sister saw me. My at the time SIX year old sister saw me high on drugs at the age of 15. That wasn’t fair to her. I still remember her face when she saw me, it’s the only thing I remember after I got home. She looked so unbelievably worried. I sobered up for a while, but six months later was an exam day. I didn’t even think about it. I just did it. No repercussions, but she had tried to call me later that day while I was still high off my ass. I ignored it. I sent her a voice message, something along the lines of “Hii pipsqueak, I can’t call tonight, but we can call tomorrow! i love you!” and that. That was what broke me. I couldn’t even call my little sister because I was too high. I was just like my brother. I haven’t used since that day. I haven’t even smoked weed in 11 months. I can’t. I can’t do that to her again. She’s 8 years old now, and she will never see that again. This upcoming fall I’ll be going to college a year early to finish high school since I get 90s-100s in college classes yet 50s-60s in highschool ones. When I graduate, I’ll be sober. Hopefully by then, my arms will be clear as well. Baby steps. I still smoke cigarettes, I still vape, and I still do harmful behaviours. But none of it with ever have to do with drugs again. I’ve cut off all addict family members and friends. This is my life, and I will not go down that path. 

“I wasted so many years being miserable because I assumed— that was the only way to be. I don’t wanna do that anymore.” Bojack horseman.

So while people may tell you that it’s impossible to get sober for someone else, it isnt. Sometimes when you’re so deep into it, it’s actually the only option. Sometimes I miss it, sometimes it’s all I think about. But those other times? I get to sleep. I get to go out without worrying about cops. I get to do so much. Even though I ruined my body and entirely fucked up the mobility in my legs, I wouldn’t be alive if I hadn’t gotten sober. Find interests you love, find something to distract you. Personal mine was writing. Novels, poems, anything. I hope this helps anyone who wants to get sober. It’s not impossible, it just feels like it. Rinse and repeat my love.",1753035439.0,3,2,addiction,addiction

Some people die with a bang.
Others rot quietly in the woods while the people who love them light candles a hundred feet away.

Brandon Laxton was 26.
He was my cousin. He had a job, a future, and a big smile. He used to clown me for popping pills. Called me stupid. Said I’d end up dead. Maybe I should’ve. But I didn’t. He did.

He met a girl on perks. It started slow — it always does.
Then came the needle.

Brandon fell hard. Got arrested. Made the paper. Even the police posted about him.


She left him. He spiraled deeper. But then… he fought back.
Checked into rehab. Started looking good again. Clear skin. More weight. Smiles.

In July 2018, he got a furlough from rehab. Came home for a few days.
We laughed. Ate. Took pictures. He said he was heading back Sunday night. We hugged him. Told him we were proud.

But he never made it back.

Brandon decided he could handle one last shot before going back.
So he copped. Walked 100 feet into the woods behind his mom’s house.
And that’s where he died.

No one knew. We thought he was back in rehab. We called — privacy laws, no answers.

Meanwhile, his mom — my aunt — kept saying something smelled awful.
She didn’t have A/C. Windows stayed open. She lit candles. Sprayed air freshener. Complained about it every day.

She didn’t know the smell was her son’s body decomposing outside.
Nine days passed.

Two boys, 9 and 10, followed the smell into the woods.
They found him.

Swollen. Black. Unrecognizable.
They had to use dental records to ID him.


That smell his mother couldn’t escape —
was her son.

She never recovered.
She died less than a year later.

But this isn’t where it started.

Because long before Brandon’s death…
my little brother Nicholas Gorman was already disappearing.


---

Nicholas was born March 20, 1988.
He was quiet — not shy, just sad. He covered it up with jokes and chaos.
He was funny, wild, and loyal.

We were all separated as kids. Foster care scattered us.
Matt and Cody went together. Nick went alone. I ended up with an uncle in Cumberland.
I thought about them all the time. Missed them every day.

When Nick was 17, I was 21. I invited him to come live with me.
When I saw him again after all those years, he looked amazing. Clean. Strong. Stylish. He wasn’t using anything.

And me?
I was high on everything. Pills, coke, crack, alcohol — anything I could get.

Nick never asked to try it. He looked up to me.

Then came New Year’s 2005.
I had pills and coke and said, “Do some with me.”
He said no.

I pushed him.
He gave in.

And just like that, I lit the fuse.

It wasn’t long before he was using like me.
Then more than me.
It hurts because I know why.

He just wanted to be like me.

Eventually, he moved in with our mom. She was deep in her own addictions.
Nick got worse. Fast.

We ended up homeless — all three of us.
After our mom stole from her boyfriend, he kicked us out.
Nick and I found a tent in the woods behind her house.

Middle of winter.
No food. No heat.

I stole from ShopRite just to feed us.
Nick saved my life once — yanked me back from stepping into traffic.

I started robbing stores. Got caught.
Sat in jail for five months.

While I was inside, Nick got deeper into heroin.
I came home and went looking for him in Camden.
Sometimes I found him. One time, he hid his arms. I already knew.

Our mom — Kimberly A. Gorman — got hit by a car walking down Marne Highway.
High on fentanyl.
She was flown to Cooper.
She survived, but with brain trauma. Hospice care.

She was awake… but not the same.

I couldn’t handle seeing her like that.
She cried every time I left.
I stopped going.

But sometimes I forced myself. I’d bring her pictures. She’d smile through tears.
God, that hurt.

Then came the last night I ever saw Nicholas.
I won’t talk about what happened.
It’s mine.

Two days later, he was in Camden.
Clean for a few days. Thought he could handle a bag.
Went into a porta potty.

And never came out alive.

My sister called with the news. I was with Matt and Cody.
I didn’t believe it. I called the morgue. Asked if my brother was there.

The woman said she couldn’t confirm.
But the way she said it?

I knew.

He left behind a 5-year-old daughter.

When we told our mom… it destroyed her.
She cried for days.
Then she started ripping out her oxygen tubes and feeding tubes. Trying to end it.

They put her on antidepressants. It helped for a little while.

Then, not even three months after Nicholas died —
she pulled the tubes again.
This time, they didn’t find her in time.

She died of a heart attack.

She was 55.


---

When it came time to say goodbye to her…
I didn’t go.

My brothers and sisters all showed up to the hospice. I couldn’t do it.
Instead, I took my daughter to Chuck E. Cheese.

Because I still hadn’t recovered from seeing Nicholas in that casket.

That’s my final memory of him.
Cold. Still. Gone.
Because of me.

Because I pressured him.

I never recovered.

I used for ten years straight after that.
Still use sometimes. I try to get clean — I do.
But then I start remembering things I don’t want to remember.
And the only way to forget… is to numb it.


---

Brandon.
Nicholas.
My mother.

They didn’t make it. I’m still here.

If you made it this far, thank you.

Don’t do what I did.
Don’t hand your brother the thing that kills him.
Don’t wait to visit your mom until she’s a ghost with a corkboard full of photos and no more time.

Don’t wait until your final memory is a casket.

Some people don’t get Narcan.
Some people don’t get a second chance.

1m4nvet,How I overcame weed addiction after years of suffering!,"Hey everyone,
I used to think weed was harmless. But over time, it took over my life. I couldn’t focus, lost motivation, and felt numb all the time. I kept telling myself I could stop anytime… but I didn’t. And deep down, I knew I was stuck.

So I just want to tell you some pieces of advice that I used to release from that addiction and things that really helped me .

What helped me break free was learning why I was addicted. I started reading real stuff — about how it affects the brain, emotions, and habits. Understanding it gave me power. Slowly, I found my way out.

If you’re in the same boat, you’re not alone. I’ve been there. So just keep fighting life is way more precious to waste it on something like that that will harm your physical and mental health 

If anyone wants the books and resources that helped me quit, just DM me or comment “interested.” I’ll gladly share — no judgment.

1m4sksg,7-Oh,"Currently going through the worst withdrawal of my life.  I need advice. I am going through day 2 of withdrawal. Chills .. sweats .. agitation… and depression. I started taking 7-oh about a month ago with mg variations. Some days I’d take up to 80 mg others less, but I would take mangda kratom pills inbetween to keep my energy up. I started noticing the withdrawals when I skipped a few doses - I didn’t want to build a tolerance.  I realized this stuff is no joke and this can get real ugly real fast. First few symptoms were agitation, paranoia, depression and mood swings. Then the restlessness. I tried to quit cold turkey - and got my ass kicked. Im on day 2 of no 7-oh. Last night was hell. I sweat my ass off all night while curling into a ball as the chills set in. I took some vitamin c and kratom just to subside the pain. I never got insomnia- and I’m incredibly grateful as I see others going through withdrawals experiencing this. I have slept at least 20 hours straight. Sleep has never been an issue, the chills and agitation are. I couldn’t recognize myself for a min and that is when i decided this sh it is the devil on earth. The vitamin c seems to be helping a bit - I’m also taking black seed and that seems to help as well. How long will this last? This has scared me so straight I vow to never touch it again and stick to my regular Kratom. I would NOT RECOMMEND taking this. Is there anything else I should take to subside the symptoms ? I don’t feel sick enough to enter a rehab, so far I’ve been detoxing pretty good on my own I think.

1m4o8mn,gaslighting myself (again) can you be addicted to some drugs and completely normal with others?,"i’m in that mood where i’ve been sober for long enough i don’t feel like i’m a true addict and i’m just being some attention whore. now i have to stay sober for my job so no matter what i need to abstain from drugs. also i have used pills to intentionally and unintentionally harm myself before so prescription or not, “addictive” or not, i should not ever be around them or any other kind of drug. 

In college, I abused the shit out of alcohol. almost died a couple times- it was just bad. I usually mixed it with weed or something and drank a TON for my body weight. In highschool i abused weed, lsd, and a bunch of other shit and college basically just expanded on that. In highschool I was 100% addicted to weed going on and off again for at most 1-2 months before starting again. 

Fast forward now- finishing my last semester of college, working a great job (federal, so i need to stay sober), and I can for some reason take alcohol. I never abused alcohol in highschool because truthfully it’s fucking gross. tastes horrible. In college somehow i just jumped in with everyone and was able to do shots and chug and whatever but if I even try that now, i will throw up automatically. 

That means that even as an addict, and someone who has almost died from alcohol in the past, I can still have just one drink now. I’ve done it many times, and it’s never shots, always wine or seltzer. 

Can anyone relate to this? maybe not my story exactly but are there addicts out there that can have a sip of alcohol and move on, but if you have me any sort of pill or inhalant i would probably go until death? I mean I have had near death experiences with pills before, like I’ve said, intentional and unintentional. I want to stay sober and I have cravings, I’ve been so addiction therapy, but it’s the alcohol thing that sets me off. I’ve never met another addict who operates like me and it makes me feel like a fraud. Most people don’t need to go to NA meetings just to abstain from drugs for their job, or just to feel some sort of motivation (that’s the depression getting weaved in it’s very confusing). I don’t know I would just like some validation and to know someone out there is the same. Pills are so much easier to abuse than alcohol. ",1753016135.0,1,3,addiction,addiction

2) There’s alcohol and weed present in my home and they are under 21. I did not supply it and they got it from places that don’t ID but that looks bad on me.

3) His girlfriend, who is also my roommate and was prior to him moving in, might defend him to the police and try to weaponize it against me. This I doubt but she also had her family bail out an ex who was an addict before, I don’t really trust her not to do something similar.",1752979965.0,0,3,addiction,addiction
1m496fu,Trying to stay sober while living with my mom who keeps buying alcohol,"

Hey everyone,
I’m in early recovery and just started therapy for my alcohol use. My therapist encouraged me to stay sober for a few days at a time and build up from there, which I’m trying hard to do. The problem is: I currently live with my mom, and she keeps bringing alcohol into the house.

She knows about my situation and that I’m actively trying to stop drinking. I’ve explained how hard it is for me when there’s wine sitting in the fridge or when she drinks in front of me. But her response was basically: “Well, just because you have a problem doesn’t mean I have to stop drinking.”
I even suggested that she could hide it or just not drink around me — anything to help make it a bit easier until I move out. But she refused.

I’m planning to move out in a few months, but I’m stuck here for now. I was considering staying with my boyfriend for the time being, but I also have a dog who I can’t bring to my boyfriend’s place, and my mom refuses to take care of my dog on her own so I can’t just stay there. I feel trapped — like I’m trying to stay afloat in a house that keeps pulling me under.

I know I’ll be out eventually, and I’m committed to getting better. But right now I could really use advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation… How do you stay sober when your home environment is full of triggers? What helped you cope emotionally or practically while waiting to leave a bad situation? If anyone has strategies for building discipline in a chaotic or unsupportive home, I’d love to hear them.
Or just any encouragement honestly. I feel like I’m fighting so hard, but with one hand tied behind my back.

Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this.

1m4dmlo,How do I bring up quitting to my dad?,"My dad has been using kratom for around 2 years now, and his dependence has gotten much worse. He's a ""recovered"" alcoholic and hasn't drank for around 3 years, and shortly after he quit he was shown kratom by one of his friends. He used to only use kratom powder, but around a year ago started drinking the strava feel free little drinks. He drinks around 6 a day, and goes to the gas station or smoke shop at least once a day. he has begun having an extremely hard time staying awake throughout the day, and has became dependent on the drinks to function normally he's extremely irritable without it, and has fallen asleep while driving my family and I around a few times which is very scary for me and my siblings. i try to talk to my mom about it but she hates confrontation and would rather act like nothing is happening. I don't want to be disrespectful but I feel like as the oldest child soon to leave for college within the next year I need to talk to him about trying to quit. what route would you take?

1m3y595,Who’s actually “constitutionally incapable of being honest”: you or your sponsor?,"First of all, this post isn’t directed at the good people in AA/NA (etc.) who operate with honesty and integrity, offering a path out of addiction that has helped millions of people. I’m not here to shit on the 12 Steps. If you’re struggling with an addiction and you think the 12 Step approach might help you, I’d encourage you to give it a try…If you find it helpful, I’d encourage you to “keep coming back.” 

At the same time, “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” That’s another idea they promote in AA. But for some reason, some sponsors never think to apply that principle to the program itself. I’m talking about sponsors working through moral inventory #4 with their sponsees who keep relapsing. If the first 3 moral inventories didn’t work, maybe try a different approach? 

Good sponsors have an honest perspective on AA. They can admit that it’s not necessarily the be-all, end-all of recovery:

* Most people with addictions aren’t interested in going to Meetings in the first place. 
* Out of the minority that attend, most will drop out. 
* Only a tiny fraction will “thoroughly follow our path” and “keep coming back” and achieve long-term abstinence. 

If you think I’m full of shit, feel free to fact-check me. 

This doesn’t mean AA is worthless. It doesn’t have to be the solution for *most people with addictions* in order to have value, just like playing guitar is still valuable even if most people quit after a few guitar lessons; only a tiny minority of them stick with it long-term, practice hard, and make the guitar a big part of their identity & life. 

This does have implications for how we treat addiction, though. Making the Twelve Steps a mandatory part of addiction treatment is a bad idea, because it doesn’t work for most people. The really unfortunate thing is when people in recovery aren’t *allowed* to do anything other than Meetings. Taking guitar lessons once a week might help them stay sober more than going to AA, but the rehab won’t allow that. That’s terrible, and that’s part of the reason why success rates are so low. 

Good sponsors acknowledge this. They are honest and open-minded enough to admit that Meetings don’t work for everybody—they might actually be counterproductive for some folks—and they’ll encourage you to attack your addiction from multiple angles to figure out what works best for you, as an individual. They’re content to work with the people who find this particular approach helpful, even if those people aren’t the majority. 

Bad sponsors will insist that you “keep coming back” no matter how many times you relapse. They’ll encourage you to stay trapped in an endless cycle of relapse, talking about your relapse, working the Steps, relapsing again, and repeat that process forever. They’ll be offended by this post because they want to believe they have the final solution to addiction that works for everybody. It’s fair to say these sponsors are “constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.” 

There’s no oversight or accountability in AA so it’s up to you to distinguish the good sponsors from the bad sponsors. Good luck. ",1752936768.0,9,19,addiction,addiction
1m4cxff,"My ex relapsed, I tried to help, and now I’m questioning myself","Last month, my ex had a drug-induced psychotic episode after mixing high amounts of street ketamine and cocaine consistently for about a month. He was placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold following erratic behavior, including leaving his dog with a homeless stranger, thinking he could walk on water, and a bizarre state of god-like grandiosity. After detoxing at the hospital, he was able to talk his way out of things. He seemed to have the right mindset on what was needed in his recovery, was super remorseful, and was supposed to start an IOP program the following Monday. After 48 hours, his mindset completely 180ed and apparently he was demanding that the IOP cater to his version of “recovered” which included using drugs in a harm reduction capacity. I stepped out of the equation because he was getting mean and erratic. 2 weeks later and I found out he was back in detox. This time around, following detox, he was planning on entering a residential rehab program that was mental health focused because doctors now suspect he’s bi-polar and not on the right psych meds. Again, he was saying all the right things, how he needed to surrender and do whatever it takes to get better, that he needs more help than he thought and wanted to try his best this time. I offered to take care of the dog during his treatment, thinking he would stay in the program.

But he left rehab against medical advice after just a few days, claiming the program was a waste of money and that he didn’t need the kind of high-level structure they were providing. Shortly after leaving, he began demanding I return the dog. I refused, not because I don’t care, but because I believe he’s still unstable and hasn’t demonstrated any real or sustained commitment to recovery.

Since then, I’ve been caught in this brutal in-between:

- I’m not the dog’s legal owner, but I’ve taken full responsibility to keep him safe.

- My ex has claimed he’s now doing IOP, but I haven’t heard from him in days (because I had to block him when he started sending me threatening and cruel texts).

- His dad agrees that returning the dog right now would be unsafe.

There’s a part of me that feels like I’m doing the right thing. I saw the chaos up close: the delusions, the grandiosity, the impulsivity, the repeated refusal of help. And yet, I’m struggling with overwhelming guilt. I feel like I’m betraying someone I care about deeply by not giving him what he wants… even though giving in might put the dog in danger again and, I sort of feel like I’d be enabling him. 

I’m also worried sick about my ex in general. I don’t want him to die. I want to help him. But I’m trying to learn from Al-anon principles and detach with love. He’s drowning but if I try to fix it for him then I’ll drown too.

Any thoughts, guidance, perspective on this would be greatly appreciated.

For more context: 

- this is a dog we raised together when we were a couple, getting him when he was a few months old. 

- I told my ex to call the cops if he has to. He won’t because they now have a record of the various wellness checks called in on him within the past month and the warrant they were able to obtain to break into his apartment and take him to the hospital just a month ago because that’s how bad he had gotten. 

- he wasn’t in a state of active addiction when we were in a relationship and this is his first time struggling with drug addiction. In the past, he struggled with alcohol specifically.

With the help of my mother, psychiatrist and therapist, I was out of debt of 30k+ usd, I was clean for almost 3 months. But then I got the strongest urge and I felt like 1 line would be enough and save my life. At that moment, I was back in deep again, for 1.5 months I started doing 2 bags daily again. Now I came to our summer house where I can’t buy cocaine, its basically like rehab, I swim, go walking, lie on the sun etc and I am fucking clean again!!!! I feel so peaceful, with tue help of my medication. I just dont ever want to go back to loop when I go back to the city. How can I prevent this from happening again? I am truly trying, I dont want to put my mother into the same situation again. She was veru supportive both mentally and financially.

1m4aum4,Drugs dreams for the last 9 years STRAIGHT!!,"I’m a recovering addict. I’m on maintenance and have been for the last 8 yrs. 9 almost 10 yrs ago I got locked up for the last time.  That’s when the drug dreams started. I was locked up for 6 months, rehab for 3.5 months, and a half way house for 4 months before I got kicked out for getting pregnant by a guy who also lived there. We’ve been together since. I’ve relapsed a few times since then for a few weeks/months but had  4 yrs clean, 3yrs clean, and a yr and a half clean. The relapsed happened in between that time. Anyway. I’ve been clean way longer than I relapsed and I’ve been clean again almost 2 yrs. Except for the time I was using—I’ve had drug dreams every single frickin night. Sometimes multiple times in a night. The last almost 2 yrs has been the same and hasn’t let up AT FKIN ALL! If I didn’t dream every single night about using, having drugs on me, looking for them or stuff to use them, or being locked up—-I wouldn’t think about using during the day! I don’t always think about it while I’m awake and it’s not obsessively but I still think about it A LOT AND I HATE IT! The only reason I haven’t relapsed again is cuz I’m too afraid. These drugs are absolutely scary and absolutely shit compared to what they were the first time I got clean 9-10 yrs ago. Not worth it to me. 

But I need to know WHY IM STILL DREAMING SO MUCH ABOUT IT? They feel so real sometimes. They feel like scenarios I could have absolutely been in in the past. I want it to stop. I was in therapy and my therapist said “it’s part of recovery” —-that’s what a lot of people tell me but they also admit they don’t dream about it nearly as much as I do for someone who’s had significant time (at much as a 4 yrs) and even almost 2 yrs like I do now. I feel like people think I’m exaggerating when I tell them how often. But I’m not. In the slightest.

Fast forward 2 months, her life is starting. She’s losing everything. She admits that she had been using and wasn’t honest about being sober in the beginning. I sat with it for a minute then I told her I understood I asked if she was sober, she said yes.

We met at work during difficult times in both of our lives, and very quickly decided to move in together. What followed was years of extreme lows and countless challenges. From partying heavily together, to me getting clean, to him becoming entangled in meth. The past six years of my life have been dominated by his meth addiction. 

I made the decision to stay, because I wanted to see it through and help him get better. He would swing back and forth between using and sobriety, holding down jobs for a while and then losing them after a binge. I finally convinced him to go to rehab after years of refusing.

He has been going back and forth between rehab stays and relapses for the past four years. Every time he gets out, it’s always the same routine of him not applying himself and backsliding back into drug usage. At this point having me in his life to support him enables this behavior, and my health constantly takes a back seat to his addiction problem. 

He plans to go back into rehab tomorrow, and seems to think that routine will continue and he can move back in with me when he gets out. I know that I am done, but am afraid of hurting him while he’s already so low.

I have struggled with recurrent insomnia for the past 4 years or so, I'd say. A few months ago, I had a bad bout, then for about a month it got better, I was sleeping surprisingly well, and now the insomnia seems to be returning.

This is obviously not helped by the fact that I am currently trying to cut back on my Xanax consumption. If it's been more than a few hours since I last took Xanax I can't sleep. Sometimes even with Xanax I still can't sleep.

I am prescribed 2 types of sleeping pills, only one of which works. However, I can't take it every night for numerous reasons but mainly because if I take it too often (eg. every night or even every other night) it starts to lose its efficacy. 

The one thing that works like a fucking charm though and puts me to sleep almost instantaneously, instead of leaving me miserably tossing and turning in bed for god knows how long, is **alcohol**. Specifically, **alcohol + Xanax**. 

I've never been addicted to alcohol, mainly because I've never had the desire to drink regularly because it used to just make my depressive thoughts worse most of the time and although it helped me fall asleep really quickly, I would always wake up in the middle of the night & not be able to go back to sleep.

But when I combine it with Xanax, not only does it usually not cause or worsen my depressive thoughts (rather, it just numbs me / makes me have no toughts, which is quite nice at least for me), but I also am miraculously able to sleep through the night. Seriously, like I am able to fall asleep instantaneously AND I get a solid 8-9 hours of sleep. 

I'm just so sick of this fucking insomnia, sometimes I drink solely because I know it'll allow me to go to sleep without any issues that night.

***TL;DR - alcohol + xanax is the only thing that erases my insomnia & I'm a bit worried about developing issues with alcohol because of this.***",1752888992.0,1,6,addiction,addiction

1m33933,I’m Matt and I’m an addict,"Notes from a recovering addict:

Hello everyone! as most of you know my names Matt, I’m in recovery and I just wanna talk a little bit about my experiences in the world as an”addict”. Anything I  say is to help the next person or family from going down the path I’ve been down. My first note is you should never openly tell somebody about your past or addiction, it only makes them judge or treat you like trash. I’ve learned that it just isn’t smart to be honest these days. You’re trying to do something positive for your life and really people don’t get how hard it is to even say but to judge you instead of sharing empathy is nudge back to addiction so therefore not saying anything is the safer choice for your addiction. Let me just say by the way, I don’t really care what people say, think or even make of this. I understand it and hopefully the next person who feels these things will too. Coming from the opposite side it might be hard to grasps these concepts as most say addiction is choice or they did it to themselves. I totally agree with those things, what I don’t agree with is if someone made that mistake and is man enough to try to fix it than let them, when they are trying they deserve the most grace and patience. Let’s them have self respect, they need it to stay off the shit. Hating yourself or being judged, Especially family will only throw you back. I had seven years completely clean, I went back. If the people around you don’t understand than remove yourself. Staying around it will only make your mental health worse. I went back when I realized my “support group” cared about themselves more than they care about the kids I brought into this world under false pretenses. I completely had it messed up. I never thought the people supposed to be cheering me on wer secretly rooting for my downfall and HEAVILY contribute to it. I’m not allowed to stand up for me, my kids or my wife. I critically think out any problem and present them with facts and evidence, I still get gas lit so some people really just will be toxic hoping you fall. Either stick to self or people that prove they have your best interest at heart. I’ve done so much good for people just to have my name trashed the moment I walk away. I’ve fought for almost 10 years for everyone to get along and understand the needed dynamic for the highest success chance possible for legit everyone involved. I started a company knowing that’s my only way out. I tried to take care of those close to me just to get slandered and put down every chance they get. When an addict is actually trying, you don’t do that. Maybe do that if they are actively messing up but when someone is trying their hardest be careful with them, listen to them, try to understand their view on the world as most addicts are dark for good reason. I’m to the point where it’s too late for me. My heart is black my blood is cold. I’d love to get back to normal for my kids but I just don’t know how anymore. My hearts been broken by family, by friends and everyone inbetween, all because of my past. People are fr evil, I could sit here and type individual things that would ruin peoples lives for being dirtbag humans but I’m not gunna go there right this second. Maybe in a book who knows. When I say I fought addiction the absolute hardest someone can I mean it. I’ve thought, analyzed, acted to see outcomes and did everything by the book. So I started with the typical meetings, did that for a year everyday, I quit because it’s bullcrap. I get the point you get out what you want and I did that. It’s the principals and people that make it unreal. Basic step is get a sponsor, which I did. It took my sponsor airing out all of my problems, all the things I told him in confidence for me to quit aa. If people are fake in that situation than a lot more addicts are doomed. So then I just strong willed it for 6 years, dealing with problem after problem. I met a girl. We fell madly in love. We had babies. The whole time my family didn’t understand her and for whatever reason she didn’t get the time of day. Look I get nobody’s perfect but again she was trying and that’s enough for me. I saw the potential where nobody else could. I somewhat can think out the future which I’m sure most do, I’m just scary accurate with it and I seen this women blossoming into a strong respected mother and women. I invested in her, poured my soul, my spirit, my philosophy morals and values into her. Being in the middle of all of that was hard on my fight for sobriety. We still have made zero progress in that regard all these years later. Once those fights got to a point after the first kid I lost it. I snapped. I died but got brought back. Things in this world a genuine person with integrity can’t handle. I tried so hard to get everyone to get along and it just isn’t possible. Some people (narcissist) will never see the error in their ways, they will never change, they only care about self. You can’t fight that no matter how hard you try trust me. I had to admit my wrongs, apologize and deal with the consequences. At what point do I earn self respect back? So anyways I do what I said above and removed us. We got our first house. No congrats, no visits, no gifts. Just more judgment because the house was on the west side and was “ghetto”. Ok great from prison to first house in a couple years and that’s what we get. Bet ok next. Now I’m trying to run a company for financial freedom that’s the next step in making a life right? Wrong. The same people I was gunna take care of are the same people dragging me. That’s why I sold the company I just didn’t give a fuck to take care of ungreatful people. I even looked past a lot with zero remorse in the first place. These things will break not only someone in recovery but a man in general. I felt so fucking stupud for loving anyone and that’s how I got here. Now it’s hard to love it’s hard to trust and I legit hate everyone. People are fake, they use you, people are grimey and just flat out rude these days. They will take advantage of any chance you give them. Especially a recovering addict because people will not respect you not matter what. I got this way by having integrity. I know what I’m talking about on a textbook level and I can’t just change my mindset after my life and experiences. I had a good heart, loved cared and wanted to take care of everyone. Because of people close to me that’s gone. I feel so bad for my kids. I will never say I regret them but I just know how hard I’m gunna have to go to protect them in this fucked up world and fucked up situation. If we all had just worked together these kids would be set but no I’m not allowed to be the one to give it to them. How can addict Matt being doing better than me. That’s what I got. And put down in response every time. It bothered people. I got so much hate I think I’ll hate for 20 years. I also feel bad for the dad I’m gunna be now. I had a spark, was bubbly, had hope man and now I just don’t. I’ve tried to befriend so many people and just get used or shitted on everytime. It’s my best friends that did me the dirtiest and that’s hard to cope with. Same with my girls friends they are the legit the fakest people on the planet. And everyone in between. Where do I go now? I have no idea. I’ve exhausted all my options and I’m fucking tired at this point. I’m spending a lot of time with my baby and that does a lot of good for my soul. Still feel guilty I’m not the happy energetic kid I used to be when I planned this family but oh well I grew up I guess. I see things differently and it’s weird man. The same things I used to ride for are now the things I see the evil in. Maybe I’ll get lost in Mexico or Vegas, maybe I’ll go rogue lol. Maybe I’ll rebound and find a middle ground with self to be able to face this life again. I’m over speaking, I’m over trying to get people to see the light so now I’ll be the dark. This is random I know but if anyone can understand the points I’m trying to make and it hopefully with help someone. Also going to Reddit as they are a lot more responsive for feedback. Hopefully some happy kid fighting for his life can get a little grace because of this one day. That’s all we need. A little grace. A little empathy. We know we fucked up. We admit that by quitting. We know it’s wrong, we are sorry for the things we did. It isn’t us. It’s the addiction. Give the person not in addiction some grace because they really didn’t do those hurtful things on purpose. It becomes so bad you don’t have a choice but to hurt the people you love. You make it right by starting a company and promising financial freedom. If that isn’t good enough than nothing will be. Don’t waste time and energy unless people deserve it. Don’t ever fold on moral and values that make you you. Even if it means losing everyone. I can sleep a lot better at night knowing I tried. I told everyone what it was and reacted to their actions. I never start shit but I will engage in it once it’s started. People slander me about my past but when I bring up theirs I’m a piece of shit. Go figure. Like I said earlier it’s too late for me. Don’t try to talk me out of it. I have a little bit of love left that I give to my gf and kids. I don’t know if a situation exists to help change my perspective. I’ve learned loyalty is an illusion and that’s where it stems from. I don’t want attention as I literally don’t give a fuck. I just needed to get this out and hope it can help the next poor soul getting gaslit into hell. Thank you all and I hope everyone figures their life out. Think it out. Make sure and if something’s off go with your gut. How i am today, I quit cigs but soke a vape, I smoke a little weed and I’ll drink only on very special occasions. I’ve learned self control through it all and only go back out when I really need to think. I think personally that’s why I used, it helps me figure shit out. I won’t do it again unless it’s gunna be the last time if you know what I mean. I won’t let my kids go though the hell that is addiction. Not anymore. I’m figuring it out day by day. I’m learning how to live with the pain and changing accordingly. Idk what I’m capable of anymore and that kind of scares me. I used to pray to god but the answers all always ass backwards so I stopped. I lost the people I loved the most to god. The cult that is as used god to hurt me. It’s hard to have a good like mindset about it. Please the next person take this serious. You can change lives by just being genuine. People need people in reality and I just had to learn how to need nothing by putting my faith in substances. They seem to be the only thing that understands me. I know this might sound crazy but it isn’t. I can explain anything anyone misunderstands or answer any questions asked. I’m Matt I’m an addict and if I can’t help myself than hopefully I helped you.

1m3b507,A few days ago I figured out I’m an addict,I have had a lot of hard realizations about my life recently. I’m very self destructive and have been for years it’s eaten a lot my life up. I think it’s been half a decade since I was last actually happy. I thought I was doing ok for years but I was still isolating and making things worse for myself. I started smoking weed and doing edibles 2 years ago and it was a healthy relationship with the drug for a very long time. But it has become an addiction I have been slowly caving in more and more. And the fact that haven’t been happy and I was denying it made it into a dependency. I started to realize that I get high too much and I have been trying to stop but I always end up using it. It gotten pretty bad this week I have gotten high almost every night. I have these mental battles where I stay I won’t get high but I have been losing them.

1m3acfw,addiction or just prescription abuse??,"Hi. In 2020 I was prescribed klonopin for extreme anxiety. I knew a kid in high school who would abuse klonopin with alcohol, and thus pass out all the time, and did not want to be like him. My doctor told me it was completely safe and to take as needed. I was prescribed 1mg up to 3 times a day. I was also on prozac for depression. I started taking it just as needed, then it developed into once a day. 3 years later I was taking it at least 3 times and up to 6 times a day. During this time I was regularly drinking, smoking weed, doing coke and ket and obviously blacking out and falling asleep everywhere. I knew I was taking too much klonopin but didn't care and didn't stop. It was also an appetite suppressant and as someone with anorexia, that was a very very very enticing reason for me to keep taking it. Eventually my doctor started to disappear. It would be a week in between ending and getting a new prescription in which i would unknowingly start to go through withdrawls. Eventually, he disappeared all together. I started to go through withdrawals cold turkey. I was extremely unwell. I thought I was dying. I went to urgent care thinking it was a terrible flu or maybe covid and they immediately knew it was withdrawals. They  thought I was going to have a seizure and tried to get an IV into me because I was so dehydrated but my veins in both arms, hands, and legs were too weak. They gave it to me in the form of a pill instead and also prescribed me a 30 day refill of klonopin so I could stop the cold turkey withdrawals and contact a new doctor to safely oversee weaning me off of it. Over the next 6-8 months, under the care of this new doctor, I safely weaned off of klonopin. These were the most difficult 6-8 months of my life, as I was working full time in person. I flushed my remaining pills when I was finally fully weaned. I have been about 2 years clean from klonopin. I still get cravings and the other night thought about reaching out to people in my hometown to try to get some pills but ended up sitting through my emotions instead. I am proud of this. 

I write this post to ask your opinion on if this is an addiction or if it was just abuse of the prescription. My family and ex have always said I am not an addict and was not addicted since it was prescribed. However, I do not think that those two things are necessarily mutually exclusive. I do not think that I am an addict in the stereotypical meaning of the word. I am not a ""junkie"" looking on the street to get my ""fix"". However, I was abusing it, and knew I was abusing it. I still get cravings and have to fight like hell to not give into them. If that's not addiction, then what is it?",1752863977.0,1,4,addiction,addiction

I’ve never had a particular issue with any of these things by themselves, but I always need to have one to be addicted to/ focus on.

That being said, how do you deal with the boredom? The boredom is what leads me to addictive behaviours. The boredom control controls my life. I cannot engage with anything unless it’s an addictive behaviour and I feel bored from literally everything, if I’m not engaging in addiction or thinking about the future where I will be engaging in an addiction I am terribly bored and I can’t enjoy anything.

1m2s431,In need of advice.,"This is my first time expressing myself outside of my friend group, so excuse me if I sound rude or condescending.  
  
I am a young adult. I've been addicted to pornography since I was 12. I've only decided recently that this is a serious issue and an unhealthy habit. I've been trying for only two weeks, however struggle deeply with extreme boredom if I'm not consistently being entertained.  
  
 I'm well aware of my triggers at this point and have minimized or removed them completely from my life. The boredom is consistent, and leaves my mind to wander for things to do and frequently lands on pornography or masturbation, and subsequently I relapse. I feel like this is impossible to do, since I lack social skills and majority of my interactions are online. I know I need to change since I feel miserable all the time, regardless of what I'm doing... especially knowing I've struggled with depression and severe anxiety in the past and this does not help.   
  
The small friend group I have are supportive of me, but I still feel ridiculously ashamed to vent or express my feelings to them, as I don't want to become a burden. My parents and other relatives are unaware that I struggle with this addiction, and I stress over telling them out of fear of their response knowing that my dad is very conservative.

1m2n2iw,Random Advice/ Addiction and Relationship,"I know I’m risking being attacked with a lot of judgment but I feel the need to ask for advice.

My boyfriend and I are both in recovery.  We are alcoholics and I have been sober 3.5 years and he’s been sober 2.  I have a lot of trust issues from past relationships.  I was in a very abusive relationship before, and I know addicts dating addicts isn’t always the best way but I don’t know how to date someone sober.

Anyways… we’ve been together for over a year now and my trust issues are getting the best of me.  We’ve known each other for 5 years.  For context to the story I became addicted to a kratom drink called Feel Free about a year ago.  My boyfriend and I both drank it but he didn’t get the addiction that I did.  I stopped doing kratom and he stopped doing it in front of me but I knew he took the shots sometimes.

I was worried about the new 7oh product and I told him to be careful since he still did kratom.  I felt like he was hiding how much he was doing from me and was worried.  

Also he just got dental implants and I used my finances to help him.  He promised me to quit smoking and I believed him because of how bad is teeth were and he knew he would lose all of them one day.

Well after doing this he wouldn’t use the nicotine patches I bought him and said they didn’t work.  That made me suspicious because he’s smoked for years.  It shouldn’t be that easy.  Well one day I was picking him up and I saw a vape in his fanny pack.  I told him something was falling out of his bag but didn’t call him out on what it was.

I could take it anymore not knowing if he was lying to me.  Especially after what I was doing for him financially.  It got the best of me and I started going through his bag.  I found cigarettes and 7oh tabs.  I haven’t said anything because I knew what I did was wrong.  But occasionally I’ll check and see if he’s at least decreasing his use.  I’m worried his implant will fail and we will lose all that money.  He does seem to be using in moderation.

Well this ended up getting bigger when I checked today.  I found two alcoholic beverages.  They are drinks he would actively buy so he may have found them on the beach or someone gave them to him.  He didn’t take them out of his bag and put them in the fridge like he does everything else in his bag.  So why is he hiding it.  If he’s drinking I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to stay with him.  I feel like I have to know but I know I’m in the wrong for looking.

I know I’ve gotten myself in a mess, but I really could use some advice.  Thank you ",1752795718.0,3,1,addiction,addiction

She’s not the same person I knew and I don’t know if I can even help her we’ve dealt with other problems unrelated to drugs but it seems every help everyone has given her over the years hasn’t helped at all. We don’t really talk anymore or see each other. All of her other friends do more hardcore drugs. How can I help if her even If I can I don’t want her to go down this path I’ve seen it in others I don’t want that for her.",1752804651.0,1,7,addiction,addiction
1m2hfcx,Emptiness hitting me again. Ranting about how I feel again because I don’t have people to talk too," I’m getting tired of feeling this emptiness. Hiding everything to everyone. To the point it’s muscle memory, I do it to literally everyone. No one knows anything about me. I’m just an entity that’s just there. Mom thinks everything’s ok. Whole time I’ve been at the lowest point of my life going back to zero every week since the March-April. Saving is impossible for me and I literally have no bills other than my monthly student loans and some credit cards. I’m just still focused on the wrong things, there’s no excuse I’m 21. Life should’ve never been this way. 

Keep giving my hard earned money to a prostitute. I did it yet again yesterday. I’m realizing I just want to replicate the feeling of freedom I felt back then. Spending so much, and not having to worry, my only focus was this girl and how she made me feel. When this addiction had just started I had spent 5 figures within that same month, I checked my bank statements. It kills me inside. Nowadays I’m lucky if I can save $500 before blowing it. This shit is fucked up. I’ve been broke for so long. Dropped my credit score 200 points. Facing debt collectors possibly. 

Things aren’t getting better. I take a step foward and immediately 2 steps back. Deleting any progress to how life once was. 20, with 50k 
of my own earned money saved. I think about it everyday. 

I’m so fucking miserable bro. I’m literally jealous over the fact that this prostitute can just move on from me any day now. I shouldn’t care but a piece of me will always want her, even after ruining everything I’ve worked for. Anytime she tells me about another guy I automatically assume she’s fucked him and it kills me. Anytime I don’t have enough money for atleast 3 rounds I act like an asshole by not engaging in conversation with her making her feel like shit is what she says. I’m just a burden to everyone ,even to the girl I can’t let go of. I’ll act cool to her then after the service it’s back to being a shitty person, it’s toxic as fuck, I know, sometimes I wonder how she deals with me, I mean it’s not like I’m giving her what I once gave her, there’s not much incentive. Which is why I feel she somewhat cares and it makes me feel like shit when I think about it, I’m treating her like shit just because I’m depressed over the fact I gave her my all and there’s always another guy texting her. She used to hide that stuff from me. Knowing there all doing better than me messes me up so bad. 

I’m so unhealthily obsessed over someone that doesn’t even care me , I don’t even care about myself anymore man. Feeling so behind in life. Financially. And Mentally. Wishing I was “normal” there’s no stop to this madness. 

Going to an SAA meeting today. In 30 minutes. It’s been months since I’ve last gone. How will I ever change if I’m not even fully committed though is what I think afterwards. Things won’t ever change if I don’t block her. I always find myself thinking of her. There was one time she seen I had 3 social media accounts all basically stalking her page. I’m so weird guys. I see why I have no girlfriend or friends. I can’t even express how I feel and it leads me to situations I don’t want to get into because I just go with the flow with her, she damn near controls my life, but I do it to myself man. I truly caught feelings over a prostitute, I never wanting to admit it but it’s the truth. I didn’t really believe it until she’s no longer in my life as often as before. 

Keep failing. Feeling like a failure. I’m honestly no better than someone who’s addicted to the hardest drugs u can think of. I’ll work all week just to spend it all on her and stress all week trying to make it back as fast as possible just repeating the same process. Excessively. It’s insanity. You would think I would get tired of feeling this way. Going back to zero. It’s not like it’s fun afterwards. Going back to my miserable reality. Don’t even feel human most days man. Wishing things were different. The only times I cry are when I overthink my life situation. Everyone says 21 is young and it’s not young enough to still be living off mom rent free, while simultaneously being a prostitute addict. I feel like I’m going to hell. Genuinely. I’m not even religious but I feel like I won’t make it. I’m not a good person. I guess that’s why I isolate. Even when I don’t want to. Is this all I’ll ever amounts to. Feeling like the biggest piece of shit. I can’t be real to anyone.

I've also had Awful anxiety and through my Hugh school years so I just gave up on an education and friends... I would have 2 or 3 severe panick Attacks daily which would last hours. I also suffer from severe insomnia ever since I could remember, I on average get 15 hours of sleep per week for the past 25 years. This all leads tk bad depression and isolation, and I would find comfort in being by my lone and I now haven't seen anybody in ky family in 15 years, no Christmas dinners, no Easter, birthdays, nothing..because I have yet to overcome the fear of being in a public space and bejng social.

Then, about 7 years ago I developed chronic disease, which is a mixture of Neuropathy,  Fibro yalgia, tendinitis, arthritis, and ither symptoms that have turned me from walking perfectly normal to having a lot of trouble walking to my kitchen or bathroom, showering is very hard, I spend 23 1/2 hours of all my days in bed because its to painful to walk..abd that's with my pain meds and anxiety meds.

Im at a point nkw when my doctors will not up my dosage of opiates or benzos. And I understand they're point kf view...but they left me completely helpless and I feel abandoned rite now.
I understand that I can keep upping my dosages for another 5 years, but in the 7 years ive only increased my dosage by 50%...which is pretty amazing after building a tolerance in 2 weeks.

So now im at a point where I dont knkw how to manage my days, my pain, my emotions, my stress, my overall mental clarity, and im always scared because im always short a few days and it always leaves me in a live threatening situation.

I am prescribed Dilaudid fkr short term pain help, and Hydromorph Contin which is the extended release form of Dilaudid sonics constantly in my system...( they say they last 1w hours but they last 6 or 7 at best) so half of everyday im sick..

Im also lerscribed Clonazapam for my anxiety...and ive been on the same dose fkr 15 years...4 .5s a day...and it does nothing anymore...

So im not stuck on 2 extremely addictive and awful withdrawing drugs...and j am faced to be sick every month because I dont get prescribed enough, ive tried everything i could think kf tonhelp my situation..weed, ketamine, shrooms, also alot of natural remedies but notjing works..they all make me wierd and i dknt like the feeling of them. Ive done all the lyrjcas and gabopentins and they made my pain worse.


Sorry fkrbthe long rant...my point is, jf im nkt gojng to ever get an jncrease...abdnim already nkt feeling the amoubt their giving me...what the hell dk i do...would take me 5 years tk detox kf this frkm the lenght and amountnimmon..and nothjng else works...indont want tk buy off the street...and im on disability so I couldn't afford that either way.

1m1x6au,Insider secrets about addiction treatment,"I work in the homelessness sector, so I deal with a lot of ‘addicts’—But we don’t use that term. We’re not on a mission to persuade anybody to self-identify as an ‘addict,’ to go to a doctor to get diagnosed with a Substance Use Disorder, to get addiction treatment, or anything like that. We aren’t trained or encouraged to use those tactics, and we don’t. 

It’s not that we aren’t interested in helping people overcome addiction; it’s that the prevailing popular idea about how to go about it—“admit you’re a powerless addict, get treatment, go to Twelve Step Meetings”—simply doesn’t work for the vast majority of people struggling with addiction. That’s why we focus on Motivational Interviewing and harm reduction instead. 

Motivational Interviewing (MI) is founded on the belief that people with addictions have the capacity for volitional choice and personal agency:

>MI relies on clients' own personal strengths, efforts, and resources. It is the client, not the counselor who produces change...**The counselor in general respects and honors the client as a person of worth, with the capability for growth and change as well as volitional choice about whether to do so** (Motivational Interviewing, 3rd Edition, p. 33)

So I don’t view any of the people I work with as ‘powerless’ over their substance use, and I would never accuse them of ‘denial’…
 
>Denial in addiction treatment is often not so much a client problem as a counselor skill issue (p. 9)

MI emphasizes collaboration and draws out the client’s own reasons for change, rather than directing or confronting: 
 
>A simple principle…was to have the client, not the counselor, voice the reasons for change (p. 9)

Once clients worked through their ambivalence, most reduced their substance use substantially without needing further treatment: 
 
>We found early on (to our initial surprise) that once people had been through the evoking and planning processes of MI they were often content to proceed with change on their own and did so. The hump for them was really *deciding* to make the change, and having done so they often felt no need for additional help. **In two early studies we anticipated that MI would trigger help seeking for alcohol problems, and we provided a menu of local treatment resources. Almost no one sought treatment, but most made substantial and lasting reductions in their drinking** (Miller, Benefield, & Tonigan, 1993; Miller, Sovereign, & Krege, 1988) (p. 30). 

Motivational Interviewing’s success shows that people change when treated as capable and autonomous, not when they’re told they’re powerless. ",1752723246.0,23,17,addiction,addiction
1m2gq5w,ER for klonopin withdrawal?,"Hi, so I am torn on this. I’ve been taking klonopin that wasn’t prescribed to me for the past few years on a regular, daily basis to help with anxiety. I was taking two 1mgs a day, then moved down to just 1mg. For the past four months or so, I’ve been taking .5mg in the morning. 

The thing is, I tried breaking the .5 in half two months ago, thinking I was good to start with .25mg since I’m desperately trying to come off of these, and I had to leave work early. I felt delirious, nauseous, I was having cold sweats, and I felt like I was about to pass out. It’s like I could feel every single sound scraping against my skin. Everything was too much. Ended up taking a half (.5mg) and felt better after. 

I need to start ADSAP to get my licenses back. I want to be free of this medication, and to learn to cope with my anxiety in a healthier manner— one that doesn’t rely on pills. I am actually 95 days free from alcohol, and go to AA meetings when I can. This and nicotine are the only habits I have left to kick. 

But I don’t have health insurance. I can’t afford to be in a rehab/detox center for a whole week for various reasons. Even outpatient care would be too costly for me at this moment— financially at least. Someone in my family suggested I get a pill cutter and slowly wean myself off of them that way, but I’m honestly super afraid of seizures since my mom had one trying to do it at home herself years back. She said she finally went to the ER, got put on Ativan for a week to take at home, and got off of them just fine. I can’t always trust what she says though since she’s a bit of compulsive liar— or just tends to stretch the truth. I DO know she had a seizure though since my brothers and stepfather were there to witness it. 

I just don’t want to get forcibly admitted and unable to see my loved ones or anything. (I have a history of being admitted into the psych ward— this would be my first time going to ask for help for withdrawal.) 

I’m considering going to the ER and just being upfront with them. I’m so tired of this, and I’m afraid to do this by myself. But if I’m not in active withdrawal, would they even help me? I don’t want to get there, and start going through hell in the waiting room. If anything, I’d be like, “hey, yeah I took a .5mg this morning like I usually do since I didn’t want to be possibly flipping out in the waiting room.” 

I don’t know what the best course of action would be here all things considered. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you so much. Sorry for the length.

Ever since I've had the recovery from that as motivation to stay the course, and the need not to interfere with some meds as extra motivation. Trust me though that my resolve goes much deeper. One day at a time, IWNDWYTD.

Everything in my life is a stressful triggering mess, so each day I make it through feels like a victory. I don't have a stable job, and it's been a year since I last did. I live in NYC and I'm on a friend's couch. I'm scraping together cash through odd jobs and generosity of friends and family, which is pretty shitty for one's self-esteem in your mid 30s. I've had to deal with more rock bottoms and regrets than I can count on my way down, from firings and other drug overdoses to arrests and homeless shelters. The only direction is up, and when I can I intend to leave NYC after 13 years for a fresh start in Chicago.

But if I can stay sober against all these headwinds, then I have to keep up the hope that things will turn around in time and that I have the resolve and strength to see it through to the life I'm trying to manifest.

I drank all the time. The shame ended those few minutes I drank. The bliss set in. Nothing else mattered. 


I tried on my own but I couldn’t do it. I went to my psychiatrist and was put in an alcoholism program. I was assigned a new physiatrist, psychologist and a caseworker. 


I went on leave from my job, and after 6 days, I relapsed. But I started over and I’m at 24 days sober now. 


The first time I came in, I was drunk. I told my caseworker that I couldn’t quit because my detox symptoms were bad. She tried calling a ton of rehab centers. None had a spot for me. So she promptly sent me to the ER.


I spent 30 minutes there, got blood work and detox pills and was sent on my way. Well about a few weeks later, the bills start pouring in. I had no health insurance, it was hard enough to afford my bills on my income. I got three separate companies hounding me for money. 


And bankrupting is becoming a reality. I never thought it’d be. The weight of that is too much. I took my bills to my caseworker, told her I almost relapsed. She took the bills, stared into my eyes.

I honestly don't know if she ever caught on but she never brought it up to me. We've been separated since last year and she never brought up alcohol during our fights. 

Ever since the separation last year I've really gone overboard. I drink an average of 500 ml of 40% vodka a day plus at least 4 beers that have 6-8% alcohol content.

Despite this, my career as a teacher hasn't been affected. I've never taken a sip before coming home from work and I reserve binge drinking for the weekends. In fact, my career is the one thing in my life showing improvement.

I've spent years with a very aggressive alcohol addiction. I've been drinking about a liter of vodka for many years. 

The last couple months I noticedy body breaking down on me. I just can't function. And it's not because I'm drunk. It's a physical think I felt my liver hard and swollen, I have been fatigued, I'm a little bit jaundice. 

So I got some blood work and ultrasounds done and it seems I have some wear and tear and possibly cirrhosis. The doctors said I can't quit cold turkey because it might kill me, even with medical supervision. I even had a doctor tell me that I might have a year left.

I have been in hostpitals all week and been discharged after 24 hrs ever time. I feel like the system is failing me. 

I need to taper but if I am that that damaged, that could kill me too. I'm going to through all the avenues and trying to fix it, but I think I might be too late. 

Please, if anyone is in a similar situation or has been, please reach out to me. I have just started this regimen, but I don't know if it's going to be enough. 

I know this is all my fault, I don't blame anyone or anything other than myself. But as a guy living in Ontario, I feel like as an addict I get treated as a typical junkie.

I have a good job, I am good at what I do, and this is just me getting stuck in a loop.

The hardest part is having a bad day and just wanting that to be what eases my mind, lets me have a meal… but they threw it back in my face the other night after getting angry at me. Telling me, “damn, just go have another fucking drink” and it seemed to hurt me more than anything. 

I woke up, a little hungover and head pounding from crying the entire night. I don’t want this to be my life. I don’t want to have to be dependent on it. I poured everything down the drain, but I’m alone and I have every avenue to continue with no one knowing.

1mq2qnm,Why do I keep relapsing,"I'm (M34) currently on my 4th outpatient medical detox this year ... 

My drinking over a year ago used to be a bender for a few days, then I'd stop for a week or so and do it again, but this past year things have gotten way worse.

I've been sober for periods of 3 months a few times and got to six months this past year and I've never been sober for those long periods of time in the past only like a week or so.

However, this time round, when I've drank after a long period of sobriety, the benders last two months and this is drinking extreme amounts every day.

The withdrawals get so bad that I have to go to the hospital because it feels like I'm going to have a seizure or something.

I've tried so many programs, I've done AA, even paid for programs myself and I've been on all the anti-craving medications like Naltrexone for TSM and to be honest Baclofen has been the best.

I like how I feel physically sober, but my brain feels like there's no dopamine in there and when I drink even if it's just beers it just fires me up and energises me.

I've never liked cocaine because alcohol makes me feel like I've been on it.

I've been on all different antidepressants and I'm currently waiting to get assessed for ADHD.

I've had many rock bottoms, been homeless, and relationships ending ..

On my last bender, which lasted a month I destroyed everything I was working hard to build back up ..

I am still a ""functioning alcoholic"", in the sense that I only drink on the evening, have a well-paid career that I love  never miss work and my performance (while not as stellar as it used to be, I must say) is still good (like my performance reviews are good) and I have not  caused any trouble to my personal relationships, nor found myself in financial trouble (in the sense that I have ́never been in financial difficulties due to alcohol, although of course I could have done many other things with the money I spend on booze).

But I know that ""functioning alcoholic"" is just a phase. I have seen my alcohol consumption increase gradually and I know it is just a matter of time until my evening drinking is too much to be able to go to work, until it transforms into day drinking to try to feel better, etc. 

So, especially if you found yourself in a similar situation to mine, what was the moment that made you say ""enough"" ? I feel like I need some insight into what could be next for me if I don't stop to help me take the decision to do it.

1mpzqay,Question regarding alcohol consumption and brain damage.,"Hello guys, I tried finding the answer to m'y question online but I didn't find the exact thing I was looking for.

My question is, if we only regard long term effects on the brain and cognitive capacities, would it be worse to drink 5 beers once a week or 1 beer on 5 different days ? I thought it was 5 beers once a week, because then your brain has 6 days to recover, whereas if you drink on 5 different days your brain never has the time to recover. This is my reasoning but I would like to know if it is completely false or not.

1mpqs7z,Alcoholism and Lying,"If this isn’t the right space for this I apologize. I’m just not sure where to turn. My husband has been an active alcoholic for several years now and it’s something we are really struggling through. He’s always had an issue with my parents. I’m an only child and have always had a close bond with them and he’s always had a very strained and toxic relationship with his, having gone over a year fairly recently not even talking to them. I try very hard to make sure he knows that I always have his back when it comes to them but it seems no matter what I do, it’s never enough and he finds ways to bring them up in probably 75% of the fights we have even when they have nothing to do with what we’re arguing about. 

The reason for my post is this, they absolutely have flaws and make mistakes. But my husband lies to people about what they do that pisses him off. I’ve seen texts he’s sent his friends and heard from his sister and mom about things he’s told them and they are 100% fabrications. He will make up conversations and insults he claims to have experienced with them when I know for a fact that none of it has happened. Almost every time something like that happens, he’s drunk so I don’t know if it’s an overactive imagination trying to justify his anger or if he has just been lying to me and everyone else about his drinking for so long it’s bleeding into all aspects of his life? Does he try to make himself the victim to excuse what is the root cause of all of our marital issues which is his alcoholism? We’re going to couples therapy for the first time in a few weeks and maybe I’ll bring this up at some point in a session but I was just curious if anyone had any thoughts on this.

hi! in may i admitted to an inpatient facility for my mental health and alcohol withdrawals. while i was there i went through serious withdrawals, put on the CIWA protocol, and was supposed to be dosed Ativan for the withdrawals according to scores. all I remember was hallucinating, being in and out of consciousness, moments of severe tremors (i might even call it convulsing). I was being given a pill that I was told was Ativan for the withdrawals and to prevent seizures- but apparently after 18 hours of being unresponsive and in and out of delusions- the inpatient center called EMS and i was transferred to the local ICU for alcohol withdrawal syndrome with DT. When I arrived to the ICU they tested my blood and urine for the Ativan I was supposed to be given and found none in both after multiple repeat tests. The ICU doctors said they’re pretty sure i was actually not being given the Ativan and that’s why the withdrawals became so severe. I woke up in the ICU 2 days later so confused, unable to remember pretty much anything from my stay, unable to feel/move anything below my waist, and unable to control my bowel, bladder, or blood pressure. My head CT didn’t show anything acute, but it’s obvious some sort of neurological injury occurred from the withdrawals with no preventative Ativan and I’m still suffering from all of the above greatly today. It’s been a horrifying 3 months and my whole life has been greatly changed as I now need a 24/7 caregiver and simply just can’t walk or use my legs and core. I have appointments set up with a neurologist and do PT/OT multiple times a week. Has anyone experienced anything like this before? Has anyone had a neurological injury occur during withdrawals?

I also talked about how much of an overly assertive asshole my department manager is. He has to interject himself into every conversation and be the “right” one. I didn’t share this, but he’s also a bleeding maga supporter, which completely discredits him as a person to me. People share about personal shit all the time, like divorces. I don’t cross talk unless it’s positive. I’ve had people cross talk negatively directly to me or indirectly at me. Our group allows a small degree of cross talk as long as it’s brief. For instance, there’s a homeless guy in our group that talked about how lonely he was feeling and I shared directly at him, acknowledging how he’s feeling and encouraging him to take steps to surround himself with quality people until he clicks with others and to try to be someone that he’d want to be around. I wanted to share with him that he should pursue resources available in the city to get him off the street, but I didn’t. I just felt uncomfortable going that far for whatever reason. I’m beginning to realize it’s the same people that dislike me and they just make me feel bad about myself. There are plenty of others that treat me well and I’m quick to not pay attention to that. There are also others that are indifferent towards me. I think I need to try and focus on the nicer people in these meetings. Hell, the mean ones basically never stay for the full meeting. They just share and leave. Of course, some stay though. They just glare at me as I share.",1755085382.0,1,8,alcoholism,addiction

1mokcz5,Wanting to get sober but don’t know where to start..,"Hi everyone, 
I’m a 25 yr old female, and my relationship with alcohol has gotten pretty concerning. It all started with college. I’ve drank before attending college, but it felt like I was suddenly just engulfed in a life full of partying and drinking. I used to black out almost every weekend, which is terrifying, but to me I loved it. It allowed me to talk to anyone and feel so social. Then the pandemic came, and that’s when the problems started. I started drinking out of boredom. On top of that, being alone a lot of the time during Covid didn’t help. Now, I have a full time job, went back to school full time (I graduate this fall), but I still drink every single day for the most part. The longest I can go without is maybe 2 days. I’m pretty unhappy in my job (I’ve had my position for 5 years now), and I have a lot of anxiety that I’ve struggled with for a few years now. I probably drink 3-5 beers after work daily, or finish off a whole bottle of wine to myself. It’s getting embarassing, concerning, and I’m starting to feel the shakes and the consequences of alcohol abuse. I really want to quit, but I don’t know where to start. I’m honestly really embarrassed to even try to get help, as I’m finally just now admitting to myself that I am a drunk.

All of this started about a month ago. I got drunk once and thought it was so fun, so I got drunk again, and again, and again. A couple of days ago, I got so drunk and woke up feeling extremely depressed and anxious. To get rid of that feeling, I thought it would be a good idea to drink again. After I got off work, I drank and felt happy for a while, but then my anxiety came back. I'm scared that I'll always feel this bad if I don't drink, and I'm craving the euphoria I feel when I get drunk. My family is full of alcoholics and I'm scared I'm going to follow in their path, but part of me doesn't even want to stop because of the temporary reward of it.

I live out in the wilderness, basically. 

I spent the next two hours paranoid and eventually realized that if someone was going to break in, they would've done it already. It didn't help that I have cats that decided to run around and jump on things lol

I was already dealing with a buttload of hangxiety from binge drinking the previous week, but this fear paralyzed me. 

Anyway, ended up staying up all morning and saw the dude come down from the woods on an atv. 

There's a trail through the woods next to my house that shows up on maps for some reason. I guess he took it to avoid a ten minute detour. 

I know it's already kind of scary to hear a loud ass vehicle on your property with no cameras or anything at 2am, but the alcohol from the previous nights absolutely wrecked me.

1mo6pja,I am an alcoholic.,"Im in my early 20s, and ive been a pretty heavy drinker since my early teen years. I guess im what you'd call a functional alcoholic. I never miss work due to drinking, i never drive drunk, i can stay away from alcohol when i know i shouldnt drink. But i do drink almost every day. Maybe only a couple drinks after work, or i wake up after my nap from work and start drinking if i dont have plans. Ive never been an angry drunk, sometimes i get emotional, but i usually plan that as a sad b day. 

I guess i just dont see a problem with it. I have friends who smoke everyday, why is it so bad i drink every day? I dont hurt people when I'm drunk. I know alcoholism runs in my family. And i swore if i ever turned out like them, angry drunks, id never touch alcohol again. But im never an angry drunk. I'm happy, relaxed, my anxiety goes away, my depression disappears. And i rarely drink enough to wake up with a hangover, so the after affects of drinking dont make my depression or anxiety worse. Even as a teenager, who drank a bottle every two or three days, never went to school drunk. Even though my ma told me i should take some shots on my lunch hour 🙄 

I know the affects of alcoholism when it comes to family. Like the back of my hand. Which is why im never a mean drunk. So i dont understand why its so bad for me to drink, if it doesnt make me bad. I refuse to let it. 

I lost some friends recently, i told them i drink alot, they told me they smoke alot. I thought we would work out, but they didnt like me. Not because of the alcohol, just because of me. And thats fine. But they blamed part of it on that, saying im going to start getting alcohol withdrawal. Shakey hands, drunk driving, going to work drunk. Ive never done this. Ive been drinking for almost 10 years, and its stayed extremely consistant. I actually drink less that i did back then. They made me feel bad for things that i wasnt even doing. 

I know this sub is to support getting sober, and god, i am so proud of every single one of you that is trying to better themselves, because they know that alcohol is making their lives worse, despite the temporary happy it gives. 

But why does everyone make me feel so bad for it? Ive never hurt anyone. I take care of myself, and i go above and beyond to care for my friends and family. I just dont think, drunk or sober, im ever going to make them happy. 

I am diagnosed bpd and ptsd, so this is probably just disordered thinking.. i dont know. I just want to be supported no matter what choices i make (as long as im not hurting anyone). Why is that to much to ask? 

(And i have family i recently connected with, who says i really dont drink as much.. well, as much as my parents did. They say i do drink too often, but i dont go overboard with it when i do.) Just another perspective i guess. 

I told my spouse id work on getting sober, because he doesnt like how often i drink, and i am reaching out for help, just waiting on my referral to call me or whatever.. i just don't see a good reason to stop, when it helps me so much. 

Im sorry, i just needed to vent. Id be happy to answer any questions, and take advice if given. Thank you for reading, i know this was long :/ ",1754999893.0,9,8,alcoholism,addiction

1mnkajc,Wife's Secret Drinking,"My wife (30 y/o) has been a secret drinker for some time now. I used to think she just went through anxiety episodes that caused her to sleep all day on occasion until I discovered some empties in the house.

It is not often, at its worst it was once or twice a month that should would consume until she was asleep for a whole weekend. Waking only to irritate and sneak to the basement

It reached a breaking point last summer where I had to pick her up from a work function off a bathroom floor. After that we finally had a conversation acknowledging the problem.

Since then it has been touch and go. She still gets too drunk at events, but not as often to the point of passing out for a weekend. More so drinking too much at a dinner or a friends house. Or drinking at an event when she said she wouldn't.

I've kept a log of all the times and have gotten rid of most of the alcohol in the house, and kept an eye on the one box remaining to see if it has been touched.

Most recently we went to a a friend's birthday yesterday where we weren't going to drink, but she ended up having 3 glasses of wine in 1 hour or so. Then proceeded to sneak drinks in the basement until bed ""Left a light on downstairs...check on the laundry..."" Whatever excuse she could use to go downstairs

Today she can tell I am a bit down and asks me why, and I just don't have the heart to say the truth why. She must know that I know, but neither of us will say it. I used to enjoy a weekend drink with friends but now I can't even bring myself to get one in front of her, as I don't want to encourage it.

1mnz3b1,I'm at a loss,"I've been posting on multiple subs from multiple accounts for the past 8 years. This is just one of 4. I was a binge drinker for 5 years (4-6 times a week probably). Now I've been in a relationship with someone who requires me to be sober. We've been together for 5.5 years now. There were 2 years of overlap there. This has been an issue for 10+ years now (I'm 28). Everyone's over it. I'm over it. I don't even know how they would react if I told them I drank today. I didn't get that messed up, but I know I'm playing with fire. I knew from the minute I started drinking at 17 that this was gonna be a problem for me, so I'd take enough breaks of trying to be sober that I never got physically dependent. Honestly I don't think it ever gets better.  Since I declared myself sober maybe 4 years ago, I've relapsed every 6 months, whether it was a one off or a secretive few weeks. All in between I think about drinking. I drank today and it was fucking amazing. The only way I can stop is if I start smoking weed and distract myself. If not, I'll drive drunk to get 1 more over and over. I buy one at a time saying it's the last. At this point, I'm like - do I just die like this? Does it ever get easier? I can't stand it. I was training for a marathon for 6 months and that kept me distracted. Now I'm between jobs and I'm starting to feel like I'm just going to think about drinking every day for the rest of time.

We’ve been doing this for 9 years and it was all going okay until we had to put down my old man Rottweiler down last year.  Now I’m truly alone most of the time.  I miss him and his presence, so much.  He made this life tolerable.  He was my hiking companion, protector, my alarm clock, my get up and go.  I’ve been a stagnant hermit angry drunk since then.

This is the longest that I’ve stayed sober.

The worst of the withdrawals have been more mental than physical.  I’ve went from eating an embarrassing amount on day one and two to having very little appetite.  I’m now over the nausea.  My head hurts but not too much.  Still ugly crying and sobbing over the smallest of things.  I feel like I could go full blown ballistic “Karen” on someone for the slightest inconvenience and that I’m sitting and just waiting for that opportunity.  I am a very bitter person, right now.

The last year I´ve noticed it´s become more and more normal for him to start drinking when we´re gaming together. This happens on any day of the week and despite the fact that no one else is drinking. Although I've been quite busy so the two of us don't play very often together anymore, when we do he´s most likely gonna drink. 
  
It all made sense when he told me once he thought he might become an alcoholic. He does have a job and is doing fine in life. But I think he has a bit of anxiety and is very lonely, so gaming sessions become his moment to let himself loose and have some fun. He describes his desire of alcohol midway through gaming sessions in a way that makes me feel it´s unhealthy. It usually goes like: ""I could REALLY go for a couple of beers right now. But i shouldn´t... fuck it"". He might even leave to go to the store and then come back. 

Recently we met IRL and also then he brought beer and started drinking in the public during the morning. He crashed an e-bike, hurt himself and put a break to our vacation. I think alcohol was part of the reason he crashed, and thought he was lucky to not get tested for alcohol consumption. Now I can't handle it when he says he says he's just gonna get some beers, as I suspect that alcohol is becoming more of a daily thing for him that can ruin his life if it worsens (just like it did to my father...)

1mn7me6,How do I go about my brother’s addiction?,"Hi, sorry for a longer post but I need an advice on what to do about my brother’s addiction.
For the last couple of years, he would often come home in the middle of night, or morning, or tomorrow. Usually smelling of alcohol, but I often thought he used coke or something similar, too. I know he does on some occasions. But over the years I realized it happened more often, even at some smaller gatherings.

Not too long ago he moved out to live with his gf, we all love her so much, and they really are a great match. But now she has told me he was drunk often, came home late, or in the morning, etc. He promised her several times he would change, but he would always relapse after a couple of days. She probably couldn’t take it any longer, and they broke up.
This was a huge stress to us when he lived at home, and now it’s stressful for her and I completely understand her side.

When you see him, he is very outgoing and friendly, jokes all the time, but he’s also very empathetic, emotional and sensible. So I think this might have all started after the death of a loved one. Also, he’s in his early thirties and a bartender, so that probably goes hand in hand with drinking and using.

My question is, how do I start a conversation about this with him without sounding judgmental? I have also not gotten over this loss, but haven’t turned to addiction as a result. Or do I do something else, and what? If she hadn’t told me, I would never have guessed, nor anyone in our family, that he drinks that much. This is not something we are all aware of in a way, or that he admitted he had a problem, so I don’t want it to sound like I’m being nosy or we talk behind his back.

1mnask2,Drink Responsibly?!,"I may be in the minority here, but isn't the term ""drink responsibly"" a little oxymoronic? Isn't the ingesting of poison, in and of itself, irresponsible? It's a black and white way of looking at it—sure—but basically, this is what I think it comes down to: ""normal"" people simply *control* the level of irresponsibility they engage in whereas alcoholics know they're doing something that isn't responsible at all and so inherently realize *control* isn't part of the equation. Typically, the intention of the alcoholic when drinking alcohol is not to remain level-headed and under control...

YOU CAN BASICALLY STOP READING HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE I'VE MADE MY ONLY IMPORTANT POINT, but feel free to continue.

So I have a basic idea: alcoholics are ""normal"" drinkers in terms of drinking something that is meant to and known to inhibit motor function and impair judgment. ""Normal"" drinking is weird. What kind of drinking is going on when someone is only trying to dip a toe jnto the effects of alcohol—when they actually *want* to keep a foot in sobriety?! Who's acting like they aren't doing something destructive by drinking? Alcohol is pretty much *for* blacking out on...

We drink to party, do we not? Alcoholics start by being party animals and then all of a sudden get ostracized amidst other drinkers because we ""can't control ourselves""? This is so laughable to me, and I knew it even in those moments that I was getting obliterated. Why is anyone allowed to drink this stuff if the guy that ""goes in"" gets sandbagged for doing exactly what the societal programming entails? You're telling me these alcohol companies really want me to drink responsibly when they're *equating* alcohol with success, status, and sex?

I know it may be a pointless rant in the sense that it doesn't achieve much beyond pointing out a major fault in society, but...

This would not be a complete post if I did not point to a more important problem the alcoholic needs to address, and it actually starts with what I've already said.

When anyone drinks, they are doing something irresponsible. In fact, think of your first drink. You knew you were doing something that is taboo—one of the biggest ""hush, hush"" scenarios that everyone knows about—that is generally acceptable yet intrinsically ill-advised.

The alcoholic in his/her/their/there/they're recovery should find solace in knowing their problem started with irresponsibility and everyone that ever drank, knowing full well that it causes birth defects and is carcinogenic, did so irresponsibly. The recovering alcoholic is now choosing to be responsible by not drinking at all. Any desire the alcoholic has to drink ""normally"" is living in the fantasy that there is actually such a thing. The idea that we could engage in this activity that is inherently irresponsible and be as irresponsible as everyone else is actually childish, and when the alcoholic sees that, it only reinforces their decision to stay the course and increase their integrity on a daily basis.

I hope this provides motivation, promotes rationality, and inspires recovery. Thanks for reading.

1mn6f3t,Drinking again,"So I’ve never addressed to myself if I was an alcoholic but I recently moved to a new part of the country and decided I wasn’t going to drink for a while just to see how it impacts my health. I ended up going over a month without any alcohol. 

Friends came to visit and I had a few drinks the past three nights which is just the norm where I’m from (4 beers max each night which is an improvement itself). 

Apart from bad hangovers the first two mornings I’ve not thought about it much. This morning however I feel ashamed that I had been drinking and this feeling of anxiety about it won’t go away. 

I had no intention of quitting outright but now with this feeling I’m having I’m wondering if that’s my brain telling me to stop or what. It’s hard because it feels like drinking is the social norm here. You meet up and drink.

1mmencw,Scared for my future - Chronic Pancreatitis,"I’m 26 years old and just this past week Ive been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and fatty liver.

I started drinking heavily in my early twenties, and by 24, I was in the hospital with my first case of acute pancreatitis. Since then, I’ve lost count of the number of nights I’ve spent in a hospital bed…my body in agony…..because I chose alcohol over my health. I would get out, promise myself I’d change, and then end up back in the same place a few months later.

The only time I ever truly stopped was during my pregnancy. I didn’t touch a drop, but just two months after having my son, I had acute pancreatitis again. That was September 2024. I told myself I’d slow down. For a while, I did. But this past month, I fell back into old habits. I drank hard, knowing exactly what it would do to me.

This week, I was in the hospital again. My pancreas levels were over 3,000. The doctor looked me in the eyes and told me: If you don’t stop drinking and lose weight, you’ll need a liver transplant by 30. Even then, you might not live past 40. You’d be lucky to make it past 35.

That hit me like nothing else ever has. I pictured my son growing up without me. I pictured him graduating, getting married, starting a family and me not being there. I pictured my four little sisters burying their big sister while they’re still so young. I pictured my fiancé raising our son and stepsons alone.

I can’t let that be my story.

Today, I’m 5 days sober. Five days of choosing life. Five days of fighting for my future. I live right next to an AA building, and I want badly to walk through those doors, but I’m still working up the courage. Maybe a therapist is part of the answer? Idk  All I know is, I want to live. I want to grow old. I want to see my son become a man. 😭

To anyone who’s been here before… young, surrounded by alcohol, and desperate for change.. how do you take that first step?

I will be 2 yrs sober tomorrow.   Yay me!  I have been very open and transparent with friends and family regarding my experience.   Every now and then someone reaches out to me with more direct questions about my journey.  That's fine and I'm glad to share.

I have a close friend who reached out to me.  His Aunt N is an alcoholic.  Gets drunk most days, but apparently functional.  In fact, aunt M recently retired a few months.  With no work and no spouse or kids, aunt N has gone downhill with the alcohol.  Aunt N wants help and has recently moved in with my friend (short term) where she can feel comfortable.  She goes to outpatient rehab 4 or 5 days a week.  It's been 1 week.
Friend called me yesterday and said aunt N is doing great.  Mentioned that she hasn't had withdrawal symptoms AT ALL.    I found that odd.  No shakes.  No anxiety.  Nothing.  don't know aunt N well enough to form a solid opinion, but my gut tells me she's sneaking alcohol.  Maybe not a lot, but just enough to suppress the symptoms.  I just find it very difficult to believe she suddenly quit and didn't have some form of withdrawal.  I'm not even sure it's possible? Has anyone here heard of someone quitting, without experiencing withdrawals?
Thanks.

1mlwktt,I made a huge mistake. I’m mortified.,"Hello everyone!! I am a 22F working on being sober. 

Last night I messed up. Bad.

I was sober for three days, but I hadn’t told my family yet. We all went to eat and my father ordered shots. I gave in. And I ordered a large beer. and shot after shot.

We went home and I texted my ex immediately asking if I could come over. Eventually he said yes and to hurry. I drove over there. I drove. I cannot believe myself.

After I got there, he sat in the car with me and talked, I tried to touch him arm, he cussed me out to not touch him. I don’t remember ANYTHING I said. I’m sure I begged for him back. Anyways he told me to go home. I got out of the car, he told me to go the F home. I followed him to the porch. He told me he’ll call my mom, and to get the F away from him, get the F off his porch, and go the F home.

So I did, and I called him on the way home, begging and crying. I proceeded to call him 40 TIMES. He eventually was begging, yelling, SEETHING, is all I remember, for me to leave him alone. And I still couldn’t. He said he was going to block me so I stopped calling. I sent some sad paragraphs about finding God and being good to him. And that I’ve never seen him that mad before. 

And then Idk what I did after. I woke up. And oh my gosh. I cannot handle it. I am mortified. I called him once at 6 am. No answer. Once at 7 am. No answer. Finally 9 am, he answered, I apologized profusely, told him that wasn’t me, and I mixed alcohol with new meds and it made me act insane. And there was no excuse. He said he’s pissed (rightfully so) but he doesn’t hate me. He doesn’t want me back. I don’t WANT him back. Idk WHY I did it. 

I am full of shame, embarrassment, guilt, everything. It’s killing me. But I think I needed this. A huge slap in the face. To make me go sober. I was an absolute idiot. I could be in jail. Someone could have died. He could have called the cops. SO much worse could have happened. I am VERY lucky.

I think I’m making this for support? To rant? Mostly, if anyone has done anything similar to someone. Made a fool of yourself. Don’t remember doing it, too.

He constantly goes out of his way to surprise me, and he’s the kind of guy who gets along with everyone and will host and organize things just to make my friends feel special. I’ve always felt physically safe with him, and he’s been my biggest supporter through so much.

But when he drinks, it’s like he becomes a totally different person , more like a barely-legal 21-year-old partying with no sense of limits. Many times we’ve been in casual social situations where everyone is having a drink or 2, while he’s pounding down 5+ drinks. It’s not just the amount he drinks, but how it changes him. He gets careless, dismissive, annoying, selfish and no filter. Then the next day, he acts as if nothing happened.

I’ve brought it up countless times, and while he’ll acknowledge and act remorseful in the moment, there’s never any real change. We’re at a point where intimacy is almost nonexistent. Sex feels like a chore, and I find myself closing my eyes and imagining someone else just to get through it. Recently, I’ve even started developing crushes on a couple of his friends. Even though I’d never act upon it, I feel incredibly guilty and conflicted.

I love him, but I feel stuck between wanting to save this marriage and protecting my own mental health. I want kids someday, but I can’t picture bringing children into this dynamic.

i’ve always thought that was bs cause personally i feel like when i’m drunk i’m 100% the real me. the thing is tho, i like being drunk me way better than being sober me.
sober me is constantly keeping things bottled up, trying not to rock the boat, just trying to get through the day with no conflict.

drunk me is confident. i’ll say what i want and mean it. if i love someone/something i’ll shout it from the rooftops and if i hate someone/something i’ll read it to filth. sober me would never do that cause sober me literally just doesn’t want to be seen.

obviously drunk me has said things that were misunderstood cause i wasn’t able to articulate what i meant well, and that’s embarrassing, but the point is when i’m drunk that’s the only time i feel i can really speak my mind. i’m able to block out the voice in my head that says “no one cares what you think.”

i’m trying to cut down and eventually quit alcohol specifically for health related reasons (nothing serious has happened yet, just trying to get ahead of it) but i’m scared to let go of this confident version of myself. there’s literally no one in the entire world i feel i can be as loose with sober as i am while drunk. not my partner, none of my friends, literally no one. that’s not any of their fault, that’s just my problem. i can’t stand myself in general so when i’m sober i just think everyone can’t stand me, so i minimize myself.

however, another problem i’m starting to have is, i’m noticing when i’m drunk i can tell people are starting to get annoyed by me. even friends that i’ve known for years and we’re basically never sober around each other. so now i’m thinking, what if no one actually likes the real, unfiltered me? and even people i previously felt like i could get drunk around and let loose without judgement are starting to get sick of me? and if they can only tolerate me when i’m sober and suppressing my actual thoughts/feelings on things, then they really don’t actually like me at all.

1mlshun,Question for recovered alcoholics,"My sister was ostensibly an alcoholic unbeknownst to the rest of the family. She drank every day and always had a case of wine in the trunk of the car and once a couple years back the doctors told her her liver enzymes were off on her blood work so she stopped drinking for 30 days and they went back to normal so she went back to daily drinking. But - she didn’t slur or act drunk so we all thought there was no problem. Actually her husband drinks more than her. Anyway, rock bottom was hit with jaundice, ascites, the ER visit, resulting hospital stay, and cirrhosis diagnosis. The doctors said she now needs a liver transplant, could have died, and she can’t drink again. When I went to talk to her with a sympathetic ear about how hard it must have been to have this secret compulsion to drink, she quickly denied being an alcoholic. She said if she was an alcoholic she wouldn’t have been able to stop and now have no urge to drink. I pointed out that she was told she could have died (how lower of a rock bottom can you have)? but didn’t press it more bc she’s obviously in denial. My question is - does this matter? Like, since she’s not drinking, isn’t that all that matters? Or is there an argument that she should seek counseling, rehab to understand why she drank, etc?",1754754107.0,8,26,alcoholism,addiction
1mlvubl,ADHD/alcohol dependency,"My partner (33M) is has severe ADHD and has been using alcohol as a coping mechanism for stress and to calm his mind. But he drinks… a lot. Like, can down a six pack no problem. Drinks beer like it’s water. I honestly don’t even know how much he’s drinking, but it’s a lot. 
We’ve had numerous conversations about it and I’m reaching my tipping point. Alcohol dependency is very triggering for me and I refuse to build a life with someone who doesn’t want to change that habit. 
But also, curious if there’s anyone out there with severe adhd who’s also had issues with alcohol? He says he uses it to calm his mind. Exercise does the same thing, and he’s been doing that, but that drinking hasn’t realllyyy decreased. He hides it from me because he gets ashamed about it, but that only creates more problems. 
We just moved in together recently, and we’ve experienced an immense amount of stress in the past few months (whole separate thing) but has greatly contributed to his stress and anxiety, and thus the increase in drinking. 

Please help. It’s like, he knows what he needs to do, but the stress, depression, and negative self-talk really clouds the view. We know he needs to see a doctor and get on some sort of med to help with the stress and anxiety, but in the meantime… what do I do?

1mldz2i,"I’m Struggling, and I Don’t Want to Do This Alone","
This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to write.I find myself crying everyday not wanting to wake up.

I’ve been battling alcohol for a long time, and it’s worn me down in ways I never imagined. It’s taken away my health, my confidence, my relationships, and my sense of who I am. Most days I tell myself I’ll get it under control tomorrow — but tomorrow keeps slipping away.

Lately, the darkness has been getting heavier. Some days, I catch myself thinking the world might be better off without me. I know deep down I don’t really want that — I want to live, to heal, to feel something other than this constant ache. But when you’re this deep in it, it’s easy to start believing the lies that alcohol and depression tell you.

I’m sharing this because I don’t want to disappear quietly. I want to fight for my life, but I can’t do it alone.

If you’ve been through this and found a way through, I’d love to hear your story. If you have advice, resources, or even just a few words to let me know I’m not invisible, I need that right now more than I can explain.

And if you’re reading this and you’ve felt the way I do — please know we’re not alone in this, even if it feels that way.

I’m still here. I want to keep being here. I’m taking the first step by speaking up. 

If anyone has suggestions to help with home withdrawal management that would be helpful too I’m very sick at the moment.

1mltd4y,Do you guys ever drunk-text people you’ve never messaged before?,"I feel like I’ve done it a few times too many. It’s not like I send anything stupid or something I’d regret - it’s always something like, “Hey, how’s it going? We haven’t seen each other in ages, I just felt like reaching out.” And a few times it’s actually led to something good. Some people were even genuinely happy I reached out. But still, there’s always that morning-after shame. Especially when someone reads the message and doesn’t reply 😬 And yeah… that’s happened to me a few times too.

Good thing I don’t have a profile picture on Facebook - some people might not even know who they’re talking to. Like someone I worked with years ago. Maybe that’s actually the reason I’m braver about sending these kinds of messages? Or maybe I’m just too lonely, and it’s starting to hit me harder and show in little ways. I don’t know.

But what worries me is that I’ve even messaged people I don’t have on my friends list - more than once. Luckily, it’s just some older guys (also from work) who probably haven’t used Facebook in years, lol. Those are the ones I’m brave enough to message, and I don’t really care, because I don’t work there anymore and there’s a very small chance I’ll ever see them again. But still… I’m a bit embarrassed about it.

I'd like to thak you on first hand if you take the time to read me an my bad writing. Thank you!  
  
 I'm from Argentina, where self care is a sort of ""higth class problem"", and i'm on the ""blue collar worker"" level, sort of speak. I will try to give you some info of where i'm standin on:  
 I have a ""rock and roll"" style of living, kind of nihilistic personalty, (even being born in a low resource income but wonderfull parents); *Spanish:/ ""tuve padres muy buenos pero yo tengo una personalidad auodestructiva"")* and have been rounded all my teenager (starting on 14yo) life by addicts, motorbikes, under bars, rock and drugs. I got the ""bikes and alcohol and hevy metal"" bug.   
  
My parents wanted me to study an get a degree(engineer/doctor/arquitect even when they knowed they couldn pay it), and i tryed very hard. To study, i have to move out, i wasnt prepared to ""live on my own"" buy i tryed so hard.. I started on ""IT devs"" (was 2005, times of visual basic, the newborn intenet, nokia 1100 and ICQ chat on rented pc's on cybers; home internet conecction was a higth class peopple ""luxury"" thing here) and dropped after 3 years couse i liked it, but 'didnt fell like it was ""something i wanted to do for the rest of my life"" and a ""no exit career"" at that time (please, never listen to anybody, just do what yo want).   
I came back to my town , and started doing shit jobs a few years till i save the money to buy tools and invest in motorbikes, start to apply what i readed on my own and dedicate all my hope on mech and be absolute shure i can live for this hobbye/passion/misery. In the meantime of this story, i drinked a lot, but always on ""days i knowed hangover wouldnt be a problem"" I was still joung around  25, one more can of beer ""miraculous remedy"" and back to work, and years passed, shit passed, and i get used to ""drown all week stress in drikn till blackouts wend-sunday weekends""  
  
Now i have 37 (i got a lot, a really lot of storyes that i'm not proud, but kind of yes, i really enyoed each caos wrecked weekend) Untill ""check engine"" started to show from that lifestyle. Friend died, a cople on bike accidents (we road always whitout helmets and mostly drunks), one murdered, one died of cancer, another from an acv. Till then, i alway was aware of ""shit hapens"", untill i got to be the last only one broken soul, and cant stop the ""weekend wreckage"", even in my home, alone, if its friday it feels like a necessity to drinck till blackout. Someday i ahchieve it, some days i keep drinkind till saturday, and some like the last weekend was from friday to monday.  
  
I have a ""self acknoledge"" autodestructive personality, and a ""kind of rare"" alcohol problem. I went to 2 diferent psicologist, and both give me the same answer: ""as long as drinking alcohol doesn't affect your work and survival life, is not a thing we have to work out now"" (two terapyst, a lot of money i didnt have, and not a slice of even ""you know is wrong, got to start on thinking: why keep on the same loop?"" sort of message, nothing. So, i shared my story couse i think i really need help. Not shure if geting my frustration on starting an AA club or what (there's no AA where i live, closest is at 30kmts plain road an i still ride a small bike and dont want to go bak to drunkdrive) but i know i got to be off this road.

I tryed in the las couple years to stop, to ""change"", and got quite a very god progress, but still i'm stuck. I turned into a ""one day on the weekend very heavy drinker"".  
  
Short story:  
Since i was 16years old, i got used to waste myself on weekends. I was surrounded by same bad peopple as me, and i happen to have very bad luck in life too, so, most of my ""keep going, yo doing well"" was from myself to myselft while drinking knout-out from frydays-sundays, as my ""days of self"" to look in my care, introspection, self consolation, round up what i lived in week and have a plan for nex week.  
I loved the hangovers, couse i use to note everything on a notebook, even the bad feelings and read it sober monday or tuesday. 20 years worked for my that way to keep control on ""what i am""-  
But i don think this is a ""happy ending story"" and i'm trying to change that.

And last weekend, my motherfker childhodd ""always sober normal best friend"" who never was abord the ""20 years self desctructive road i was going full speed"" saw me when i was down and needed a hug, and the first thing he do, was search the mirror and a card. ""*I'm Ozzy you are Lemmy,*"" said.  


And there is my biggest mistake! tomorrow i will feel like the ""shit that is still on te way in Godzilas guts on covid"".

1mkvk74,Sobering lesson,"Hi everyone,
TLDR: 34F with cirrhosis of the liver. Always be your best advocate

Last week, Wednesday morning I posted I checked myself into the ER after nonstop violent vomiting from the day before and losing use of my legs.
I was seen pretty quickly. At this point I was exhausted. In a way I'd sort of known I was drinking to the point of death and a part of me didn't care, but I was also so tired, so tired of hiding it, no longer going out so I could drink. I felt fat, my face was puffy, and I'd called out of work too much and was getting near my first warning. So, I was honest with the doctors that I was drinking every day. I'd gone from drinking ~6 beers a day to 2-2 1/2 of those damn Beatbox things every day, and had been drinking every day for some years.

The hospital was in overflow mode. Looked like a damn warzone. ER ward was crammed with stretchers in the hallway. I spent a few hours on two IVs and was given an ultrasound on all the organs then they moved me into the hallway where I stayed in misery for about eight hours. SO loud, I couldn't sleep, I wanted to leave but I felt awful. I was checked on regularly and had started being put on a regimen of phenobarbital to prevent seizures. I was surrounded by nurses so I wasn’t alone. I needed to give work some proof I was addressing my chronic health issues causing me to call out (at the time I was still prioritizing work and keeping my job, paying rent over my own health).

I was finally moved to an overflow ward. It quiet, cool, and I had a cool TV on a jointed arm haha. I was basically under medically supervised detox at this point. Regular rounds of phenobarbital, zofran injections, lots of bloodwork. The nurses were SO sweet. I ever once felt judged. A few of them commented I appeared jaundiced. After a day in there a doctor came and saw me and said my bloodwork seemed okay, but I still didn't feel right. I couldn't eat, I felt it was too early, and I was already plotting to go back home and go straight to drinking. So the doctor said he'd keep me another day and do some more work-ups. Mind you, I was still on the phenobarbital regimen.
Next day he comes back and asks if I'm ready to go home, but I'd just thrown up that morning, so he seemed kind of like, ""Well, okay, we'll keep you."" IDK if this is because this doc was assigned to the overflow ward or what but THANK GOD I was honest with him. My father and his lady had visited the night before and they both commented my eyes and skin appeared yellow. My father is in the medical field and suggested I bring up the possibility of alcoholic hepatitis to the doctor so I brought that up as well. The doctor kinda shrugged and said fine, he'd run more tests. I started regretting it and wanted to go home and tried bargaining with the nurses and they said I would be leaving AMA which would impact coverage. I'd been to the hospital before for something unrelated and knew they did payment plans, but I really preferred any sort of coverage I could get.

The patient load in the hospital thinned out and I was moved upstairs, fully admitted. I was still on the phenobarbital and zofran injections. Turns out all my electrolytes were terrible so I was also hooked up to IV bags of like... all the electrolytes. I'd also been complaining a lot about a pain in my upper right side.

I wound up getting an abdominal xray and eventually an MRI. A doctor came to see me and told me I had really high bilirubin levels and something else was off, I forget what tbh. He said I needed to stop drinking and asked if I wanted to consult with GI specialists, I said no.
He left for the day but I changed my mind and told my nurse to let him know I was giving the green light to speak with the GI team. He came back the next morning really excited lol. I was getting my vitals and bloodwork drawn every morning (4-5AM usually -_-) and he said my levels weren't going down enough. My bilirubin level was 8, where the normal level is 1. At this point the pain in my side was becoming severe, so he prescribed me a very low dose of morphine. Very low. It helped take the edge off the pain in my side, but wasn't enough to, ""feel,"" anything, and not enough to take away the burning of some of the IVs. But still made them more tolerable. Instant hot packs also really helped.
A GI specialist came and said my liver was severely damaged and I was in danger of needing a transplant. I spent a good portion of the day crying but eventually wiped my tears. No where to go but forward right? I asked why it wasn't seen before and they said because the GI team hadn't reviewed it because I had refused at first.
After a couple of days, I was still checked in on regularly and weaned off the phenobarbital and switched to taking the Zofran orally along with some other vitamins. Monday was my last day receiving IV electrolytes.

My side hurt so badly and I couldn't eat, so they let me stay another day just for pain management. Eventually the doctor said there was no other medical reason to keep me unless I wanted to go into rehab (I didn't). So, I went home Wednesday and am on bedrest til Monday with a note excusing me from work so I am on medical leave.

My side still hurts a lot and I am struggling with eating, but that is because my liver is swollen, swollen liver tubes. I got a rubber hot water bottle and it works better than the morphine! Their specialized GI clinic is going to call me by Monday at the latest and I will be going in to work with them and have a treatment plan.

I can never drink again, I can never take NSAIDs again. I am fortunate that I haven't really had any physical cravings for booze. More mental cravings, just chilling and getting through the day and my boredom and ADHD and insomnia with booze. But I'm okay. The cirrhosis is irreversible. I never thought this could happen to me so young. It's a sobering lesson literally and figuratively.


I'm so glad I stayed though and found out and didn't listen to the doctor in the overflow ward, if I had I would've gone home and drank again and probably be on the floor right now.

Thank You to everyone again for all your kind messages when I first posted I'd checked in. It's a new day. Learning to value myself still needs work but I’m still here.",1754660542.0,56,21,alcoholism,addiction

Also who *doesn't* want help? 

Why does rehab exist if this is the most important criteria?

""If you were willing to truly help yourself, you wouldn't rely on a recovery program and just kick alcohol yourself"" is how it comes across. Like ""treatment is useless even if it puts you in a better place bc you're weak"" is my honest take away. 

Sorry if this is offensive, it just feels redundant and hypocritical. Ofc people need assistance, but approaching that and assuming they're helpless comes across kinda harsh and it probably isn't factually true. 

I'm sure people *have* made full recoveries despite not initially being willing. 

Just seems super redundant like telling a suicidal person they have to ""love themselves""

Luckily, she is not having the issues I’ve been experiencing. She has been off alcohol other than weekends (since we are college kids, no big deal) but I can’t seem to shake it. When I do research about alcoholism and withdrawal nobody seems to talk about the depression that comes with it.

1mlf4sv,I’m worried I’ll never be able to talk about this with those I care about in an appropriate way,"I have been in recovery for over a year but, due to a family situation that I rather not get into at the moment, I’ve hardly told anyone. My therapist and my fiancée are the only ones in my life who know outside of meetings. My therapist and I have been talking about telling one of my sisters who also struggles and I really do want to be able to tell my friends some day, especially by way of apology for some of my behavior. However, whenever I play through one of these conversations in my head, I can only see myself being extremely petulant, especially if it’s an unexpected conversation. If it came up with my sister or a trusted friend I know in my heart I’d want to be honest but I really think I’d be quite obnoxious as a reflex. Perhaps it’s out of shame. 
TL;DR: I want to openly discuss my issues with loved ones but fear I’ll behave like a caught teenager

I want to get away from it, mostly because I keep finding myself tempted at every corner. Spending 8 hours a day looking at bottles that I've told my partner I won't touch is rough. I came home with a free bottle that I was planning to give away as a gift, but in the back of my mind I want to keep it for myself. He's giving me the silent treatment, and I'm giving it right back because I feel like anything I say is going to be a lie.

I've been putting applications out left and right, but I can't seem to get a bite from anything outside of the alcohol industry. I can tell myself there's always time to make a change, but I feel like I'm stuck on a mountain I climbed with no plan on getting down.

1mk638s,Need advice on how to help my friend who is spiraling.,"So i have a good friend, we will call M.  

He has been through some shit.  He had a kid with his first wife, and she was a toxic abuser.  She fabricated domestic charges against him, got him removed from his home by the police, and then launched a full court press to get max alimony with him getting minimum rights and access to his child.  

It was horrible.  He lived with me for a while and i helped him through it as best i could. 

Fast forward 10 years:   He married this wonderful woman we will call A.  She is great and they now have two kids of their own.  He still has partial custody of his first daughter.  

Here is the problem:   His exwife recently launched another legal battle against him to again reduce his rights and maximize her child support.  He has really struggled with this.  

He started drinking just about all the time.  He is headed into full alcoholism.  Hes at the point where if he comes over, he brings his own beer and drinks the whole time.  Usually his wife will do the driving when this happens.  

He is spiraling.  And his wife is now telling my wife that she is maybe going to leave him if he can’t pull up on the stick and stop this steep descent into full blown addiction.  

What makes this worse:  She is saying that when he gets really drunk, he is disrespectful and rude to her.  Not abusive yet, but just a drunk asshole basically.  

Im an addict in recovery myself.   Im doing well, and have NO problems being around people who use drugs or drink.  

Heres where i need help:  These days he only talks to his drinking buddies.  He doesnt really open up to me anymore even though ive reminded him that im there for him.  

I need advice on what to do to help him. 

I cant really tell him that is wife is gonna leave, cause that was confidential between her and my wife.  

But i feel like he fucking needs someone to wake him the fuck up.  Before she leaves.  If that happens i am certain he will spiral into full blown alcoholism even worse than the current state.  

From one dad to another, i need to reach him.  

Has anyone done this for someone?  What did you do?  Did it work?

I legit dont know how to have this conversation with him, and id love some help.  

I fucking love you guys by the way.  If you got this far, thank you for showing up.  

Any advice is welcome.

1mkbrcw,"Worried about my husbands drinking, need advice","Hi everyone, 

I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this recent issue I’ve encountered with my husband.

As a background, alcohol has been a contention in our relationship for the last few years. His mother is an alcoholic and can be abusive when she drinks. I find that my husband is similar - he can be very mean when he’s drunk. He does not get drunk often. 
My husband struggles more with drinking daily or every few days - around 3-4 tall boy beers, sometimes higher alcohol content. Our issues in the past have been with me encouraging him to limit it (just to weekends or less) and over time it always becomes a problem again (for example, buying 4 beers to drink on the weekend slowly turned into buying 16 beers for the weekend over the span of 6 months). Things only change when I address it and nag him. 
Over the last year, he had multiple instances where he drank over the legal limit and then drove (when going to DnD games with his friends). He would come home “tipsy” (blood shot eyes, slight word slurring/stronger accent, smelling like alcohol). I told him it was unacceptable but he insisted he was okay to drive. The last time he did it (March 31st) he picked up our son from my mom’s home and drove him home while under the influence. This was the breaking point for me and I told him I can’t trust him around the kids and if he doesn’t admit he has an issue and try to work on it, I can’t stay with him without severe anger and resentment. I myself have a lot of trauma around addiction as my father was a drug addict, which my husband knows. 
He went to see a doctor who said he was “fine” but when I asked him about what was asked and how he answered, his answers didn’t line up with the truth of the situation (like alcohol impacting his relationships, or taking risks when drinking - like driving). 

Since then he’s told me he can never not drink again but he will rely on drinking non alcoholic beers and only regular alcohol on occasion. He’s been doing great, although I find he drinks lots of non alcoholic beers (like 3-4 a day) he hasn’t been drinking much regular beer. 

However, today he was working for home. I went out with the kids at 11:30. We have a doorbell that records video and I noticed he left the house at 12 with a reusable bag and returned only 5 min later. Only thing that close is our convenience store. When I got home he smelled like beer. I asked him multiple times about his lunch time “how was lunch” “what did you eat/drink” “what did you do during your lunch hour”. Never mentioned leaving the house or buying anything. No beer in the fridge, no empties in recycling. Snuck to the basement where his work/gaming area is and found a beer in the bag. I’m assuming he bought two tall boys, but he’s hiding it from me purposely. 

At this point I’m not sure what to do. I’ve confronted him so many times over the last year about him keeping things from me and lying and I feel like talking never works. And I honestly cannot trust him to be honest about his drinking habits with me, as today has proven. He can’t see that this is a problem. And it’s hard because he’s not getting drunk often or hurting us or doing anything dangerous lately, so it’s seen as “no big deal” to him. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

1mj8enw,518 Days Sober,"518 days ago, I looked in the mirror and thought, “Oh no. We can’t keep doing this.” I was puffy, tired, and emotionally fried…basically a raccoon in a bathrobe pretending to be a functioning adult.

So I stopped drinking. Cold turkey. I had failed repeatedly at my moderation fantasyland. It was just me, white knuckling through cravings, awkward social events, and the crushing realization that I had no hobbies besides vodka cran, wine and crying.

It wasn’t easy. It still isn’t always easy. Sobriety didn’t turn me into a zen goddess or fix all my problems. But it gave me me back, with clearer skin, actual sleep, the ability to cry for normal reasons (like pet videos, not shame), and most importantly the feeling that I wasn’t constantly disappointing my family. 

So, raise an herbal tea (my new addiction) to emotional growth, and remembering what you said last night. One weird, wonderful sober day at a time ",1754495574.0,474,14,alcoholism,addiction

1mk5huj,Helping A Parent When You Live Abroad? (sorry if this is in the wrong sub!),"Growing up my mother (f60) would have a glass of wine/beer once or twice a week with a meal, but was never really into it further. I (31f) moved abroad around a decade ago, and regrettably only see my family twice a year if I can afford to travel home to visit - they don't visit me. 

I recently came home, and while I was aware that my mam didn't have a healthy relationship with alcohol and had been using it as an an emotional crutch for a while, things have escalated in the last 1-2 years. 

When I first tried to discuss it with her, I made sure to bring up her mental health, assuring her how loved she is and how much I will always care for her before mentioning drinking directly. I was very cautious not to imply she should stop drinking, or imply that her drinking was the cause of her pain, I just kind of wanted my mum to know that she is valued as a person, I see her struggling, I see how much is on her plate and I want to help. And if I can't help, I want her to know there's people who care. 

She seemed to appreciate it but brushed it off, assured me that she was okay and that I had nothing to worry about, that she was just stressed with care giving for sick family members as well as working. 

Well, it's now gotten to the point that her memory is significantly impaired, she used to be the most lovely woman who taught me empathy, patience, understanding and kindness, and now she has earned an honourary PhD in obliterating my self esteem and self worth. There's a reason I don't come home often. 

She was once my best friend, and is now another voice in my head who tells me I'm not good enough. 

I tried to be direct with her, address that her words are incredibly hurtful, but she is so defensive and instead of listening, mocks me as if I'm the mother and she's the child. 

I told her that her drinking impacts not only her own health, but that it makes it very difficult to be around her because I worry for her safety, and selfishly, she is so cruel to me it makes me happy that I don't have to be around her any more than I currently do. 

My father is still around, but so apathetic and quite frankly uninterested in helping her, as sober or not, she is particularly passive aggressive towards him over the last decade. I think her being so emotionally checked out/drunk means that he no longer feels a target on his back.

My brother has had this conversation with her tentimes over. 

There's only so much that I can do to help someone who doesn't want to be helped. I love her, I want her to be happy and healthy, but I also know I can't force her to do anything she doesn't want to. 

I feel so powerless and I feel like I'm losing her. If she continues to drink, I don't think I can continue to be around her, and all I fucking want is her. 

I know I can't wave a magic wand to provide clarity, support or sobriety, but are there any things that I can do (especially when living so far away) that can encourage her to feel loved, supported or build her self esteem? What would you have wished your family did for you? Are there things that your family did that helped you to be more comfortable or trusting of them?

I’ve been drinking every day for the past two weeks, which is the longest stretch so far. But now it’s starting to really affect me especially my mental health. I’m on antidepressants, and lately, I’ve felt super low and sad unless I’m taking my Vyvanse. I don’t even enjoy working out anymore, which used to be my thing.

It’s also starting to affect my relationship. My partner has told me I need to stop, but I’ve still been sneaking shots after work just to numb the stress I’m feeling mostly from work and financial stuff.

Yesterday, I told myself enough is enough. I’m starting 30 days sober today. I know it’s not going to be easy, but I just want to feel happy again to know I can enjoy life without needing alcohol all the time.

My other cousin struggles with hard drugs on top of alcohol. My sponsor and I are talking about alcoholic death vs spiritual life. She had me look at the pros and cons of both. All this has made me come to see that I can totally enjoy life without the presence of drugs or alcohol. I've gotten so much mental clarity just from being sober. I've been learning new things and enjoying things I used to enjoy before drinking and using. Ever since I've become sober, I've enjoyed life more, surprisingly. I never thought I'd ever be in an AA or NA room because I, for the longest time, REFUSED to quit drinking and using. I still definitely have those tough moments, but knowing if I take that first drink/drug, I lose all the sobriety I've gained this past month. This disease is a bad allergy and I'll  break out in bad decisions and have to deal with all the consequences from drinking or using. I have no common sense when I drink or use so with that, there is no easier/softer way, therefore, I must not use or drink. I must stay sober to be present for my spiritual life.

So I went to my psychiatrist to lay out the truth. And they enrolled me in an alcoholism program. I was assigned a caseworker, a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I was also forced(not a great word really but can’t think of another way to put it) to go to the extremely expensive ER to detox. Which financially killed me. My caseworker could not find a rehab facility that had a bed for me. On a side note, this cracked my mom and I up waiting 7 hours at the ER. My ex texted “are you going to rehab,” I told my mom. She said tell him “there’s no beds”. 


Let me start by saying, I do not like therapy. I recognize it’s helpful to people but I genuinely have not stopped dreading it everyday. The desire to drink is the worst on these days. Recently, my caseworker told me let’s meet twice every two weeks instead of every week. I was ecstatic. 


Then yesterday, she came to my house. I missed her call so I called and she let me have it for that. I had no idea she was coming but she claimed she was seeing me the 4th and the 7th as well as today. What?

I've tried off and on for years, but this is now the longest I've been truthfully, 100 percent, sober. After nearly 20 years of abusing my body with alcohol, I feel like I finally have hope that I can do this.

I've fooled myself before by thinking ""I just have to quit, and I'll never have to worry about it again."" I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a daily choice that never leaves me. Relapse is always right around the corner if I don't watch my step. 

I had to accept that I simply can not drink ""normally."" I can't just ""dabble."" It's a slippery slope every single time. If I give it the chance, the alcohol always wins in the end.

1mh2zlz,40 days sober — starting to feel mentally strange. Has anyone else experienced this?,"I used to drink heavily for about two years. Now I’ve been sober for almost 40 days. I exercise every day, and physically I’m feeling better and stronger.

But lately, I’ve started to experience some strange mental shifts. I keep thinking deeply about “why am I me?” — and sometimes I get the unsettling feeling that everything around me might be fake, like I’m the only real person and the rest of the world isn’t real.

Whenever I get into that mindset, I feel a little anxious and scared.

1mh507h,"My younger brother is drinking heavily these days and he’s starting to slip again, how can I help?","My little brother is only 18 years old and I am 22, lately he’s been secretly drinking downstairs in his room almost every night. He has lived an extremely hard life as our mother died in 2021 due to alcohol poisoning and his father died, when he was incarcerated for things he had did to me when I was a child, due to drinking hand sanitizer. Our older sister has been “missing” for a couple of days too because she refused to come back home and chose to live the street life in a city unknown to us. We are still under child protective services but moved into the adult section where we receive financial support and services, I attend university in a city four hours away and he is still in the care of my very strict grandmother who had threatened to kick him out if he had ever gotten drunk again. 

Last year was especially hard because he had fallen into deep psychosis after his weed was laced and got into coke, where he was put into a psyche ward for about three months and would hardly make contact or progress without the use of drugs and a counsellor. Before he was admitted, he was heavily abused alcohol and would get extremely violent and threatened to kill all of us in our sleep - even our baby brother who was only 8 years old at the time. I would assume he has been clean for sometime but there is just no way to know for sure. These past few weeks I found out he’s been getting his bottles from a restaurant that does not ID him because he looks wayyyy order then he looks. 

I am so scared for him. He recently created a new facebook and has been posting public posts saying he misses our mom and his dad, how our family cat who has moved home from home with him is the only person that understands him and how he wishes that the fake profile scammer who would take advantage of his sickness last year would reach out again. 

What am I supposed to do? He suffers from depression and anxiety, I fell like he would hate my guts if I tell someone like his worker to help him more. I was only visiting for the summer and he had been okay since he came out of psychosis since last year. I’m really scared because what if my grandma really does kick him out? What if he cuts off all contact with us like my big sister did? Will he even be okay? We had been talking about life plans and him possibly starting post secondary education. Do I just wait until tomorrow to speak to him when he is sober? 

My brother is so sweet and kind and funny when he is sober. He likes taking walks with me and talking about making our own constellations and the big what ifs. Anytime he spots a street cat he just has to take a picture of it and show it to the rest of our siblings. He loves having a cup of coffee in the morning with this god awful vanilla creamer and he has a thing for the black bag of doritos because it was also moms favorite too. He loves video games and playing his piano. He is a movie and tv show nerd and absolutely loves reading his manga and telling me about new songs that I should totally add to my playlist.

My concern is the underage kids and the parents/adult buddies providing alcohol or inviting these minors out to party. And again,,, no one does anything but complain as if that’s going to work. I’m getting so fed up with it that I really am willing to rat out my town and esp the major alcoholics that I known to have bought alcohol for or partied with an underage person/s. And there is, truly over a 100 names to name 

What’s even worse is that these adults KNOW and are AWARE of how old these kids are and still choose to provide for them. And the only excuse that’s ever used when said adult is questioned why they drink with minors, is that generational trauma stuff. Over and over again I’ve heard these topics, generational trauma & grief, being used as an excuse to why they drink the way they do or act the way they do.. 

And let’s NOT forget the amount of parents around here that are alcoholics and addicts, either selling or buying in front of their kids. The main thing these alcoholic parents / adults around here do is, drink with kids in the house. It happens EVERY WEEKEND 💔

1mh71wo,How can I best support my sons father?,"I (29F) I am looking for advice on how to help my son’s father (32M). When we first met about 4 years ago I didn’t know he was an alcoholic, and since then he’s gotten multiple DUI’s, been hospitalized numerous times and most recently this February suffered a seizure and other medical complications which doctors where not sure if he was going to make it. By the grace of god he was able to make it out and it seemed like he was on the right track to recovery. He was going to meetings, going to the gym, working, etc. 

For some context, him and I are not together and our son is 3 years old. Our relationship was always rocky but I’ve always done my best to support him with his sobriety, every time he got a DUI, I was there. Anytime he was in the hospital I was there, I’ve always tried to be there for him and hear him out. He’s a vet and was over seas, he doesn’t talk much about it but I believe it affects him greatly. 

Most recently he broke his sobriety, and I am at a loss. I really thought he had hit his rock bottom earlier this year and I truly believed his medical emergency had scared him straight. Now that he’s been drinking he’s been saying things that are worrisome and I don’t want him to hit rock bottom again. Is there anything I can do to support him or make him realize that drinking is not the answer? 

I want him to be healthy and sober not only for our son but most importantly for himself. ",1754292787.0,1,7,alcoholism,addiction

I got accused, abused and harassed last night by a boy I saw a couple times because he was so sure I was transgender. I am not transgender and I showed him baby pics, birth control pills, nothing would convince him that I was a woman. We even took a bath together weeks prior and so although we never hooked up, he had every shred of proof that I was born a female. 

He wouldn't believe me and I don't know if it was the alcohol making him paranoid but he flipped out and took my ID and refused to give it back for about 10 minutes, yelled slurs at me and then told me he was going to block me and never speak to me again. 

Throughout this, I continued to show him kindness because I really loved this boy. Will he realize once he sobers up that he wasnt thinking clearly when he was drunk or is he going to forever remember me as someone who he believes lied about their gender?

I have no desire to drink, but I also have no desire to attend meetings or put any more time into AA right now. I kind of feel like the only reason I've been continuing to do so is to appease other people, people being my sponsor and my mother. They both try to encourage me to attend meetings, and obviously my sponsor wants to meet regularly as well. I know the point is to give back what I've been freely given, but honestly I was a very high bottom drinker, no hospital/detox/rehab/sober living/relapse etc., and managed to stop before it got to that point.

1mglbnl,Solved my alcohol problem,"If you’ve ever heard a bad job can take years off your life, more than anything else, this is why. I worked in the car business, at a dealership. Not all dealerships are bad but this particular one was. I never drank before this job. Never. Never reached for bottle every night after any job I’ve ever had in the business. After 5 years, it went from a drink at lunch, to lunch and dinner, to the extreme. I would keep shooters in my car, a 6 pack of beers, bottles of vodka, etc. I drank and drank and blacked out and threw up multiple times. I would drink a fifth almost every day of the week and finish with a 6 pack at the house. I drank while shopping, before I slept, when I woke up, at 8am, it didn’t matter. I kept it a secret from my family. I almost destroyed my dream car. The toll of this and the conditions I worked in made me bite constantly at the inside of my mouth, to the point it hurt to talk or smile or eat. I finally got out of the job once I didn’t recognize myself anymore. Immediately, the urge to drink stopped. I didn’t drink for 3 months. I stopped biting the inside of my mouth. I ate regularly, I didn’t feel the need to drink much if at all. I had curfews/times for drinking and never strayed from it. Maybe on the weekend I would get a lil tipsy but never more than 2 drinks. I am here to say it’s possible to stop, but you have to want to change. I have my dream job now, my family is better, they love that the old me is back, and I feel so much better. That bad job is taking years off your life more than you think. It is worth it to quit, take evening walks with the ones you love, and have slow weekends.

1mgs40k,Shortness of breath leading to pounding heart. Anyone have experience with this?,"hey everyone, just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced anything similar to this throughout their time drinking. 

for the past 3 weeks or so, i randomly started having pretty bad shortness of breath. i feel like my lungs are only working at 30% capacity and i have to work super hard to get a full breath in, and i'm out of breath even getting out of bed. one night i woke up after taking a nap and had a few drinks, and soon after that had serious trouble catching my breath and my heart started pounding. i wasn't sure what it was so i went to the ER and they ran a bunch of tests including an EKG, chest x rays. and blood work, which all came back fine.

  
i went back home and stopped drinking for a few days and still struggled with it although it wasn't as bad. i finally started feeling better so i figured i'd be okay to have some drinks again, but later that night the same thing happened again and i started freaking out so i headed back to the ER. they ran another EKG, along with some different bloodwork this time which came back fine once again. 



i mentioned to the doctor on my first visit that i did drink a lot, and now on the visit that i just came back from yesterday, they are theorizing i have GERD which is causing my stomach acid to come up from my stomach, burn my esophagus causing it to swell, making me unable to breathe properly. they prescribed me some type of antacid which i'll be picking up today to see if this gets any better.

  
has anyone else struggled with this? if you have. once you've taken the prescribed antacid were things alright? could you drink again?  i'm weird and exclusively drink hard liquor / spirits because i don't like drinking in large quantities and i'm sure this has had a much worse effect on my stomach rather than if i was drinking beer, wine, mixed drinks, etc. i'm wondering if i were to cut out the spirits and move to something else while taking the antacids, maybe i'd still be able to drink.

  
just curious about this and i have a lot of questions. any help is appreciated. thanks

1mgrlqz,I'm angry with my mom,"I have been sober for about 18 months and my brother is an addict as well and likes anything that makes him feel good. She knows we both have issues, though she is a major enabler. She's been in a really dark place since her uncle died, they were really close and a year after he passed, her dog, who was suffering from a heart condition, needed to be euthanized. So, understandably, she's been in a bad place.

Anyway, enough back story, I went to visit my family since we all live within walking distance, and she pulled a pint of Captain out of her purse and poured some into her cup. She then asked if I wanted the rest. I almost said yes but decided against it because I knew if I did, I'd walk to the party store across the street to get more so I said ""no thanks. It's not like it'll help my situation right now anyway"" since I'm currently dealing with some other personal issues that she's aware of. 
She doesn't hold her liquor well and she started talking about how she just wants to stay in her bed all day drunk. She then looks at my brother and offers him the rest and at first he said ""no I'm good"" and then she shook it at him and said ""aw come on. You sure?"" So he took it and drank it. 

I cannot express to you how bad he is with alcohol. My mother knows this. She supports his habits. She sells him her medication be ""she needs the money"" but it's not helping anything with him. He literally almost died when he was 19 because he was drinking isopropyl alcohol and passed out in a snow bank. He had so much built up in his system that he needed dialysis to clear it from his system and it permanently damaged his kidneys so they don't function as well as they should anymore. But she is an enabler and they're codependent on one another. 

So yes, I'm angry with her because wtf is she doing? She's enabling her own child to continue a downward spiral because she's miserable. She's destroyed his sobriety so many times and I will not let her do that to me too. 

I just needed to get that off of my chest. I did talk to my sister in law, my brother's wife, about it because wtf was she thinking offering alcohol to a recovering alcoholic and an addict??",1754248101.0,1,0,alcoholism,addiction

I want to be better especially for the person I love. I find myself lying to them out of embarrassment. They know about previous difficulties with alcohol that I’ve had. It ruined friendships and made me feel horrible, but I keep thinking that I want to find a healthy relationship with alcohol. I know that’s probably a bad mindset to have and I should commit to just quitting, but I’m stuck in a house that constantly has alcohol in it. Idk when I was really bad I white knuckled it and drank seltzers to ease the sensation. I’m just so scared that even though I’m happy I’ll find myself sliding back into old unhealthy habits. I just need to know if there is a way to keep alcohol in your life in a healthy happy way or is it all or nothing. Am I just gonna have to bite the bullet and completely quit. Not to ramble but I have found a pretty balanced relationship with alcohol; however, I keep finding myself taking these times by myself to get drunker than I should. It’s a lonely thing even though I have people. It’s hard to completely release these feelings that dominated my life for so long. I wanna be better and I am better but there is this nagging thought in my head that keeps me going back to drinking by myself. ",1754206659.0,3,1,alcoholism,addiction

1mg3c2l,How I Stayed Sober for 6 Months After a DUI: What Actually Helped Me,"I’ve been sober for 8 months. It took a DUI to force me, but I want to share exactly what helped in case it helps you or someone you care about.

You can’t just try harder. If alcohol is the only thing helping you cope, quitting on your own is almost impossible. You need structure and a full reset. Here's what worked for me:

1. Look into an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) through your health insurance.
Choose one with daily breathalyzer check-ins and an accountability app. That structure gave me the momentum I couldn't create alone.

2. Medication helped a lot.
I took Naltrexone. It made the cravings so much easier to manage. Even if you don’t want full treatment, this can give you the space to think clearly.

3. Go to AA meetings just to listen.
You don’t have to talk or believe everything you hear. Just being in the room and hearing real stories helped me stay grounded and reminded me where this path leads.


The hardest part is your mindset.
I wrote a short book about that. It’s honest, simple, and helped me stay focused:

1mg8v4y,How do you deal with in laws who abuse alcohol?,"My mother struggled with alcohol as long as ai can remember, it caused us to have a very strained relationship. 

Once I became an adult her alcoholism became extreme and she was in and out of rehab. I thought she was doing good, and she decided to drive to visit me in college out of state. (This was very odd as normally she would only see me a time or two a year when I’d come home) during this visit she was drinking the whole time and tried to lie about it. She also had an interlock device which is how I found out she had gotten another DUI. She also was unable to even fill up her gas tank due to not having enough money. This all was a shock to me considering I thought she was sober. 

I was so upset and angry at her for putting me in this situation and not being able to not drink for the few days she was with me. however I just acted nice and didn’t confront her. I just didn’t want to go through the heartache that would come with that conversation. I decided then and there that I needed to set a boundary and not speak to her so I could focus on finishing college. Fast forward 6 months, I am 1 week from college graduation and get a call that she had passed away due to her addiction. That visit would be the last time I’d spoken or saw her.

1 year later:

My husband and I got married just a month ago! I’m so happy we’ve been together all throughout college. His father also struggles with extreme alcoholism and has been sort of absent in his life. This is something we were able to bond over. Despite losing my mom I pushed through finals, graduated, and my husband and I both had a really successful first years as working professionals. 

His dad has been in a facility for a while now because he messed up his brain a while ago due to abusing alcohol. He attended our wedding and seemed to be doing much much better! 

He asked to visit our house on his way from the facility to his sisters (my husbands aunts). He had been staying with us for a couple days and I have caught him sneaking drinks around the house. I am so triggered and upset by this, and I am also so nervous to tell my husband. I don’t know how he will react. Should I tell my husband when he gets home from work so he has the opportunity to have the conversation that I never did with my mom? Should I wait until his dad leaves in the morning so I can make sure he doesn’t blow up? Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

1mfhu5g,"1 year sober today. I replaced drinking with reading and lifting and now I feel smarter, sharper, and more alive than ever.","Last summer I had a weirdly vivid panic attack after two margaritas at a friend’s BBQ. Heart pounding. Chest tight. I laughed it off. But deep down I knew, alcohol wasn’t working for me anymore. I used to think I was high-functioning: crushing deadlines, hitting bonus targets, showing up for people. But once I quit drinking and started reading daily instead? I realized I was operating at 50% the whole time.

I thought I was escaping stress with alcohol. Turns out I was numbing the exact signals trying to wake me up.

Once I got sober, I didn’t just feel clearer. I felt *smarter*. My creativity came back. I started making better decisions, especially with money and relationships. My skin cleared. My sleep was unreal. I started reading daily to fill the space drinking left behind, at first just 15 mins before bed. But it became the anchor of my entire self-growth journey.

If you’re feeling stuck but “functional,” here’s what helped me actually *level up*:

* Put a glass of water in your hand when the craving hits. It tricks your nervous system.
* Track how you feel each morning. Energy. Clarity. Confidence. Watch the curve rise.
* Replace “I need a drink” with “what am I avoiding right now?”
* Set a book timer. 10 minutes a day. No phone. Just read. Let your brain breathe.
* Take photos of your face every 2 weeks. No joke. Watch it change.
* Don’t tell people you’re quitting forever. Say “I’m experimenting with clarity.”
* Get weirdly obsessed with learning. It makes you high in the best way.  

After 10 months alcohol-free, I’m not “missing out.” I’m locked in. I started feeling emotions more fully, but also processing them faster. I feel like my brain restructured itself — it’s faster, more precise, more playful. And daily reading played a huge part in that. It’s the one habit that completely rewired my thoughts. Here’s what helped:

*“Quit Like a Woman”* by Holly Whitaker NYT bestseller. Raw, fierce, and sharp, Holly dismantles the whole “wine mom” culture and builds a feminist, science-backed case for sobriety. She helped me reframe alcohol as an industry problem, not a personal failure. I cried twice. This is the best sobriety manifesto I’ve ever read.  
  


*“This Naked Mind”* by Annie Grace Insanely good read. Psychological, logical, and emotion-neutral. Annie breaks down how alcohol manipulates dopamine and trains you to crave it — while also showing you how to reset your nervous system with clarity and compassion. This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about “relaxation.”  
  


*“Dopamine Nation”* by Dr. Anna Lembke Best book on addiction + modern life. Stanford psychiatrist explains why we’re all dopamine junkies now, even without substances. Reading this helped me see how alcohol, TikTok, and even work were hijacking my pleasure system. It was like seeing the matrix.  
  


BeFreed: My friend put me onto this smart reading app built by Columbia researchers when I couldn’t sit still to read full books. It turns nonfiction books into 10 min, 20 min, or 40 min deep dives depending on how deep you wanna go. You can customize your personal podcast host voice & tone & personality, I picked the sexy smoky female one that sounds like Samantha from Her. Addictive in the best way. It also customizes book recs & learning roadmap for you too, mine included ADHD tools, high-performance mindset books, and trauma recovery reads. I honestly use this more than TikTok now. TBR killer.  
  


The Reframe: Designed for people rethinking alcohol. CBT-based lessons, cravings tracker, and daily insights. It doesn’t shame. It re-educates. It helped me go from “I need to stop” to “I want to feel this clear forever.”  
  


Andrew Huberman’s Podcast: Especially his episodes on alcohol and neuroplasticity. Bro is a neuroscience machine. Listening to him while walking gave me both the science *and* the motivation to keep going. Bonus: the voice is soothing AF.  
  


If you’re thinking of quitting, or even just cutting back, you’re not broken. You might just be brilliant and buried under a fog that’s not yours. Daily reading gave me back my thoughts. My focus. My edge.

Try reading like your life depends on it. Because it might.

I usually come upstairs in the morning by 11am which by then he’s already had at least one drink whether that be wine or hard alcohol, I’m not awake to verify just how much he has before I get up but he’s always drinking by the time I am. He’s a big dude 6’3 and almost 300 pounds and so he doesn’t get those same “drunk” qualities I’d imagine from an alcoholic outside of being playful and cheesy and then leading to aggression by 4 or 5pm. I have no idea just how much he has but we go through an incredible amount of bottles of everything from wine to vodka to whisky. Though he says “I could stop tomorrow if I wanted to” I do not believe that. Even when we take small outings like going to practice golf swings for an hour or seeing a movie, I see him with a flask. He’ll have alcohol in the car with him even which is so risky if he were to be pulled over for whatever reason. His liver is not good and he lacks concern. He has done a no alcohol challenge once and experienced withdrawal symptoms . I’ll see him sitting on the couch with a glass of wine, a whisky glass, and a water (usually untouched) lined up.

1meymk6,alcoholic neuropathy,"i’m not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this, but i have a couple questions.

i’ve been a pretty heavy drinker for about 5 years now, but i’ve gotten a lot better these past 2. i used to drink about a bottle of vodka everyday from 2021-2023, and since 2023 my drinking is still pretty heavy and frequent but definitely not as bad. anyway, lately i’ve been noticing my hands going numb. the sensation is on and off, and it happens a lot while i’m sleeping or the first few hours of the day. it’s really strange and painful, and i’m afraid i may have drank myself to the point of neuropathy. this feeling went away for a couple months when i cut my drinking down by like 90%, but i’ve started drinking more frequently again and the feeling is back.


i do plan on going to a doctor and telling them about this, my question is, is it possible to develop alcoholic neuropathy this “early”? i’ve never experienced any other forms of withdrawal.

i’ve seen my ex go through this where his hands would lock up when he’d begin withdrawing, and once he got sober it went away completely, but i see some people saying it’s permanent. so, if you have experience with this, how do you manage and has it gotten any better for you?",1754060075.0,3,6,alcoholism,addiction

1mevipu,Will I really be happier?,"I hear stories of people saying they’re so glad they became sober and they are happier and enjoy life more than when they weren’t. Does that only apply to hardcore alcoholics? I drink once or twice a week anywhere from 4-7 drinks per those nights. I wasn’t always like that though. 

I had my first drink at 21 and it was a one time thing. I didn’t drink again until I was 23 and it was only about once or maybe occasionally twice a month and only a couple when I went out to clubs with my friends. That slowly became every weekend or off of work day. But eventually I wasn’t drinking with others anymore. I was doing it alone in my apartment drinking 3-4 times a week and a lot of those times exceeding 10 drinks until waking up the next morning not knowing what happened. 

Always responsibly though never drank and drove or drank while at work or anything like that. And I wouldn’t get hungover, as crazy as that sounds, if anything it would make me more energized the next day. I was younger then though.. I definitely don’t feel that way now if I ever do get hungover (very rarely now). Anyway, eventually I replaced alcohol with edibles and started doing those every day after work/off days all day. Then I started using both for the first time and that became an occasional thing but still getting high everyday. Realized that wasn’t normal and stopped completely. 

But started drinking only again. This time I wanted to limit myself to twice a week sometimes I’d drink only once, sometimes it was 3 times. But it was still a lot of drinks on average 10 per night I did. I’m 27 now and as I was getting older I was feeling the effects more and also I struggled with crippling anxiety that got better over time. 

But recently after having a bad experience with it and blacking out for the first time in YEARS and having a complete panic attack about it, the alcohol has been amplifying it and when I get to that 6th drink I start telling myself “why am I drinking? Can this feeling go away? I regret drinking this much” Kind of like when you have a bad experience trying weed and you just start freaking out. I knew it wasn’t normal anymore or was making me feel worse as I drank more. 

Like the best feeling for me is around drink 3 so I limited myself to 5 drinks and that’s where I’m at now drinking every 3 or 4 days only 5-7 whatever I can handle without getting too drunk. I feel like I’m thinking too much about it, getting real technical with it. Like I’m not normal and other people who do it socially don’t worry about stuff like this. 

I want to quit completely so bad because the thought of being tied down to something like this and rarely being able to go a straight week without doing it freaks me out. I’m scared of addiction, any addiction so this really messes with my head. And I want to be sober completely but I know I’ll miss having that feeling of relaxation and being tipsy and happy enjoying dinner or a show I’m watching. That’s usually what I do now a days. I don’t go to clubs or bars anymore. I usually just stay in and watch my favorite reality show while eating takeout. 

I feel like my mind wants to normalize it but I’m not sure it’s normal. I’m scared I won’t enjoy holidays or special events as much now.. I wish I was able to be the kind of drinker to only do it on special occasions or holidays and not think about it for the rest of the year. Sometimes I feel stupid, insensitive or rude for even thinking I’m an alcoholic when there’s people out there that can’t go a single day without drinking from the time they wake up until they pass out to sleep. But if it’s causing this much turmoil and anxiety it can’t be normal. I also want to be healthier in general I just want to be happy and have that moment of euphoria without substances. Anyway I just wanted to rant and get any advice from anyone. Thank you for reading this far if you did.",1754052295.0,4,4,alcoholism,addiction

1metr48,Want to Visit Best Friend but She’s a Huge Drinker,"I want to start this post by saying sobriety has never been my goal and I’m able to moderate very well thanks to naltrexone. My relationship with alcohol has completely changed and while I occasionally drink socially, I mostly abstain. 

Years ago I used to often drink a liter of vodka a day and then some. Ive come a long way, I don’t feel cravings for alcohol and while I occasionally drink, being around people who aren’t drinking actively or struggling with alcohol themselves has been an important part of my journey and an important part of me not going back to how I was before. 

My best friend recently moved and I really want to go visit her. But she’s really struggling with alcohol. It’s part of her daily life and I think she gets wasted every night. She’s been at odds with her family about her drinking, been in several car accidents and I’m not sure she’s in a place where she can go a few days without it. 

I love her and I’ve offered her my support without judgment because I’ve been there myself. She’s been begging me to go visit her but I’m not sure I can be around that type of behavior without being triggered myself. 

I cannot afford to go visit her and stay in a hotel versus her home. I miss her dearly and am worried about her but I also feel protective of myself. 

I don’t need her to be sober but she occasionally tells me that she’d rather have beer than a meal, or how much she’s craving vodka. She stops texting me by a certain time every night and I know it’s because she’s wasted. She often has to miss work because of hangovers. 

I feel guilty. I want to be there to support her through more than texts but … 

I don’t know. Any words of wisdom would be appreciated. ",1754047066.0,1,2,alcoholism,addiction

I’m currently down to drinking once a month. I keep seeing people saying that they have to drink in order to function and not shake etc. Wondering if the reason I don’t have these withdrawal symptoms is because I was drinking excessive wine instead of vodka etc? I’ve had a few episodes of hearing voices in my head for about 4-5 days last year and the beginning of this year and even with the countless things I’ve been threw due to drinking those voices/ episodes  were ultimately what was able to help me put the bottle down and get serious about trying to quit. Now I think I have a sugar addiction due to the yeast, sugar & carbs from drinking wine because I’ve never had these intense sugar cravings while drinking wine or before that so I’m working on that.

1me0q1l,Drinking half a bottle of vodka every night for 6 years,"I mean every single night I drink half a bottle of vodka. It was nonstop and I actually enjoyed this lifestyle. I was drinking so much. That half a bottle didn’t do anything. It barely touched the surface. If I didn’t get super drunk, I would sweat all night and so it encouraged me to keep drinking to prevent any type of withdrawal. So finally, I said “let’s try to quit”it sucked so bad. I hated it and I realized I was very addicted. I got mad at myself, I got mad at the people around me and I kept questioning myself. Why would I start something that was so harmful?

Well, it’s been 60 days since then and I will drink a glass of wine, maybe two or three times a week. My skin improved. My thinking improved and also my work improved.

I know some people may be struggling with the idea that your life is fine and so why do you need to quit?  But your life is fine then why do you need to drink? You’re missing out on a life that is so much more vibrant.

1mekjni,Day 1. I’m tired of spiraling after my breakup.,"About a month ago, my boyfriend (32m) broke up with me (30f), effectively ending our relationship of three and a half years. I was blindsided. It happened out of nowhere. He said he wasn’t in love with me and hadn’t loved me for months. He said he thought I could tell. He said this multiple times, which felt like a cop out to me.

Meanwhile, he had let me move in at the beginning of the summer and get a job by him. He lives an hour away from where I previously lived. We were going on trips. Two days before he ended it, we spent the entire day together on a fun date day. He was sending me daily tik toks about how much he loved me and wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. A couple weeks prior he got the new Switch and said that it was “for the both of us.” We joked like usual, spent time together, everything. He was telling me that his friends wanted to take trips with me, inviting me to hang out with his friends, etc, but then told me I didn’t fit into his life. 

I was devastated. I loved this man with my entire heart. I never trusted someone enough to feel like I’d ever marry someone until I met him. I had shared everything with this person. I communicated to him before that my biggest fear was being in a relationship with someone who didn’t love me because of my own parent’s loveless marriage. 

I have a huge history of MDD that I’ve gotten help for since I was a teen. I’ve also struggled with alcoholism since I was in my early 20’s, something I’ve also been working on. Since the breakup, I crawled into a hole. I’ve felt worthless. I’ve felt angry. I felt like I was building a life with this person, who consistently assured me that that was the case. 

Anyways, I’m tired of spiraling. I’ll still probably wake up hurting a lot of times, but the shame of drinking is holding my healing back so much. Here’s to not drinking for the first night since the break up. Hopefully the first night of many. ",1754014725.0,2,6,alcoholism,addiction

1me3aa0,I’m still trying to process it.,"My mom passed away January 2. She was drinking a liter of vodka daily or every two days while chasing her drinks with beer. I believe she began heavily drinking like this no more than a year. Looking back, there were signs of liver damage, but that’s not what I want to mention here. Watching my mom actively die from liver and ultimately kidney failure was HORRIFIC!

My mom has 7 children, and we all watched her pass away. I will never forget watching her body swell at least 3x her size. Her eyes were so big and yellow. She had blood pouring from everywhere there was a hole—eyes, ears, nose, mouth.

We loved my mama so much. Even in this state, when she finally coded, we told the doctor to bring her back, and we didn’t care if they broke her ribs in the process—we just wanted her alive. We watched them put her in a body bag and transfer her to the morgue.

What I witnessed and had to endure watching her pass was horrifying, and I don’t wish that sight on anyone. Although it was hard to watch, we never left her side because we didn’t want her spirit to be alone while she was transitioning.

I think about my mom every day—no exaggeration—and it’s so draining. How does a hospital stay go from “your potassium and salt levels are low” to “now you’re dead”?? Her death was truly unexpected and devastating to say the least.

I know it’s cliché to say, “You’ve got one life to live…” but it’s true. We all got to go one day, but don’t go out like that.

I have wonderful stay at home wife and toddler, a well paying 20 year career, a house, paid for cars, vacations, good relationships with family and layers of respectable and loving/caring close and extended friend groups.

I’ve drank nearly all of my adult life, and like most people I know my drinking and partying like a college kid tapered significantly from 20’s/college into adulthood.  To the point there are very many days where I don’t drink and frankly I don’t even want a drink.  

However, my job in sales and client entertainment has always put me in situations where alcohol was involved if I wanted it.   Either through the normal course of the work via dinners, happy hours, events, conventions or through work rewards like sales leaders trips and obviously alcohol has always been available around vacations, family gatherings, guys trips - I’ve always taken part.  

My closest friends outside of work are my childhood friends.  We have pretty different lives, but we talk/text daily in some cases for 30 years.  They are all still single with no kids, but are successful in their businesses, which over the years have come to include bar and restaurant ownership and alcohol importation and wholesale - which frequently puts me in even more situations where alcohol is not just involved but central to their lifestyles.  

Over my 20+ years of drinking, I’ve probably had 1,000s of experiences/days where I either don’t drink, have one drink, or have a setting-appropriate amount of alcohol.  I could count hundreds of times especially related to client events, work trips, and “guys” trips where the people around me are drinking significantly more.  Many people that know me well probably think I’m completely fine; I even recall some instances of people close to me saying how fun, interesting, or successful my life seems to be.  

What only a few small people see, and what I experience, is that maybe once a year or 18 months, I’ll pick up a drink just like any other day and for some reason I won’t stop drinking till I fall down.  Something happens, I just won’t stop.  Rather than enjoying the drink and the situation and being thankful, or at worst getting hungry or sleepy, I become sad and I can’t shut off.  Out of nowhere I can just tell that the alcohol is making my emotions completely change.  My behavior becomes unpredictable, I experience sadness and anger that is frankly not even real.  It’s like I begin imagining that I’m a loser or life is hard?  I can’t even recall a time or situation where these feelings would be true (or true enough) to rise to the level they do

My closest friends have seen it happen and pass it off, I’m sure they would have concern, but I don’t think it’s happened enough in their presence because I’ll usually go off to be alone.  But, now my wife has seen it happen 3 times over the past 7 years.  Most recently was supposed to be a very normal Sunday that I was greatly looking forward to.  Planned to meet my friends early afternoon to play golf and discuss our annual Christmas dinner, and later have a swim and dinner with my wife and son.  A1A kinda day.  Thankfully, but regrettably, my wife and I talked because I was suddenly spiraling and I hadn’t checked in with her like normal.  I stayed with my friends and later got a hotel so my son did not see me drunk and behaving sadly.  What was supposed to be a great Sunday somehow completely was shattered by unrealistic emotions and drinking.  

The fact that I couldn’t be around my son is just something I can’t live with, it can’t happen.  

I just can’t explain to myself or my wife. 

The fact that I can’t predict when and I cant control my drinking when it does happen bothers me to the point I wonder if I should just quit all together.  It wouldn’t surprise me if it didn’t happen again for a year or more - but the fact that I can’t say it won’t ever happen again is heartbreaking.  ",1753982201.0,2,2,alcoholism,addiction
1mdk1jt,My life is governed by a 24-hour clock that ends in sheer terror,"I need to write this down, maybe just to prove to myself that it's real. I'm not proud of my relationship with alcohol, and it's reached a terrifyingly predictable point.

The pattern is hideously simple. A typical night is heavy drinking—last night, for instance, was 5 Chouffes and 5 blonde ales, all pints. The following day is a complete write-off, spent recovering from a crippling hangover. Then, once I feel human again, I repeat the process. I've been trapped in this relentless cycle for about a year.

But the worst part isn't the hangover. It's the ""hangxiety."" And mine operates on a precise, cruel schedule. It kicks in almost exactly 24 hours after my last drink. As I write this, that deadline is less than two hours away, and I'm already bracing for it.

It always starts the same way. I'll drift off to sleep, only to be violently ripped awake about 20 minutes later by a terrifying sensation: I can't breathe. My airway feels clamped shut. I bolt upright in bed, my hand instinctively grabbing my chest, trying to force a breath that won't come. For what feels like an eternity—but is probably about five seconds—there's just silence and a surge of pure, primal panic. I can feel the seconds stretching, each one a countdown to an imagined end.

Then the breath finally crashes in, and with it, the full force of a panic attack. My heart starts hammering against my ribs, wild and erratic. My vision starts to tunnel, energy drains from my limbs, and the cold dread of fainting washes over me. My one coherent thought is that I live alone. So I stumble to my front door and unlock it. A grim precaution, just in case this feeling of impending doom is more than just a feeling.

I have a well-rehearsed drill for this. I go back to my bed and force myself through a breathing exercise: inhale for 5 seconds, hold for 5, exhale for 6. I repeat this over and over until the frantic rhythm in my chest begins to subside. It works, but it's exhausting.

After the initial attack, sleep is no longer an option. The fear of it happening again is too great. So I spend the rest of the night—usually until 6 AM—forcing myself to stay awake, distracting myself with anime or anything I can find on my computer.

Only when the sun is coming up do I finally allow myself to collapse into a fragile sleep. The next day is a ritual of penance and repair: flooding my system with mineral water, taking vitamins, drinking lemon water, and forcing myself to eat well. But the physical toll lingers all day: the elevated heart rate, the cold sweats, the strange, prickly feeling on my skin that won't go away.

I wanted to write this all out because I couldn't find an experience that precisely matched mine. If any part of this story, especially the 24-hour delayed panic, sounds familiar to you, then I guess my main point is that you're not alone. Good luck to us all.",1753913266.0,55,12,alcoholism,addiction

Shes been to rehab probably at least 8+ times. 

The last 60 days have proven to be especially destructive. She’s 1) Had a felony DUI, 2) gone to jail for it 3) rehab 4) went to the hospital for alcohol poisoning and ingesting a bunch of benzos in a possible suicide attempt 5) placed on a 5-day psychiatric hold 6) relapsed again 7) went to another rehab and left AMA at 3 AM 8) went to a hotel and drank for 2 days, 9) checked herself into another rehab and 10) left AMA again after 2 days. 11) She’s back at home and appears to be drinking again according to my son. 12) Last night she ordered an uber and had it take her to a burlesque/stripper club alone. I know because my son has her location. 

At this point, her family is no longer interested in supporting her emotionally and she’s at risk of losing their assistance financially. She has no job. 

Full disclosure, I have had my own demons with alcohol in the past but am sober now going on over 2 years. I found the only way for me to get sober was to distance myself from her alcoholism and it’s worked very well.

I am moving fast now on the divorce but I do want her safe and alive for our kids. I don’t know what to do. You can’t have someone committed for substance abuse or at risk of suicide. 

I’m sure I am leaving out some details that are important to know to help so please ask. ",1753982934.0,0,5,alcoholism,addiction
1mdpo7h,Having a hard time with things spouse has done blackout drunk,"My spouse (45) is a binge drinker. Once he starts he cannot stop, he doesn’t go home until the bars close and is usually blackout drunk. His binges typically are 3-4 days. 
Since meeting me he really has done so good. He use to do this every single weekend, and like this year so far it’s only been 2 weekends the whole year. He is trying, and is doing better. Which I am happy about. 
Here is where I struggle. Almost every single time he is in a binge he will bring up his last two exes, and one of the times he drank he actually messaged one saying he will never love anyone like he loved her. I saw it (after he came home and passed out). When he woke up he said he didn’t even remember doing it, and says “I get sentimental when I drink- that is not true at all”. 
For some reason this has really stuck with me and I am having a really hard time with it. 
From people that deal with this- In your experiences have you done things like this while blackout drunk and not mean them? Mind you this is not the only thing he’s done I struggle with- it’s just the #1 thing. ",1753928534.0,16,22,alcoholism,addiction

1mdt77f,I think my mom has a drinking problem.,"Hi everyone, first post in here as someone hoping to get some advice/ assurance that what I’m thinking isn’t out of this world. Might be long so if you read it all thank you. 

From the time I can really remember my mom has never been good at holding her alcohol, it’s very rare that she can socially drink and not get close to wasted or problematic. She’s not an open book and it’s taken years to really learn who she is and what she allows her kids to know about her. I’m her oldest daughter, and I’ve just dealt with a lot when it comes to her and her up and down emotions. My parents have been together almost 30 years, but as of recently they are visibly struggling. 

Over the past two years I would say, there have been multiple instances where she has gotten way too drunk and caused huge problems. For example, my boyfriend and I got into a pretty huge fight and my parents unfortunately were involved. We both were very drunk (we were in our early 20s btw) lots of hurtful things occurred but we got through it. I always voiced to my mom that I didn’t want outside people to know what happened and I’m so sorry for involving them…well she got drunk and told my aunt everything and I overheard her while I was in the bathroom because they were outside the window. I miscarried and didn’t tell anyone outside of my parents and sisters, somehow her best friend and sister both know??? To put it lightly, my trust is almost gone and I feel so betrayed. At my baby shower a year ago she caused a scene with my boyfriend’s dad, because she drank too much wine. Really offended him and since then she never apologized like I asked her to. It’s caused a huge divide. She definitely lies, she’s quick to be argumentative, she has a victim mentality in most situations, and she is especially snappy with my dad all the time. 

Many other things to go with that. Like I said she cannot socially drink, once she gets going she can’t stop. The white wine is what really gets her going but honestly her drunk in general isn’t fun to be around. She really struggles mentally and has always been hard on herself for her weight fluctuating, she always wants to diet and workout and get better but it never sticks. Always tired, moody often. Stomach issues currently and never hungry. But she used to binge eat at night. I know she’s struggling and she will keep shoving it down inside as long as she can. But my other sister and I have been trying to be proactive with her and encouraging to help her get healthier again.

My point in all this is that, recently I’ve found mini wine bottles in her work bag when she has said she’s “done with wine” and I also found a peppermint schnapps airplane shot. I went to look again the same night and they were gone. Found another empty mini white wine in the recycle under some things. So she’s hiding it which makes me realize this may be worse than I thought….does my mom simply have a problem with drinking or is she an alcoholic? Any advice for next actions or how I can help her re route this?? My boyfriend lost his mom to alcoholism & I do not want to lose her. Thank you for reading.",1753939706.0,4,1,alcoholism,addiction

1mdaapf,35 years old and treated for severe pancreatitis - this is day 17 sober,"I just spent 15 days in a hospital with severe pancreatitis related to my drinking. Today is day 17 sober and I am never, ever, ever going back to that BS poison. I've had several previous wakeup calls about it, but this could have actually killed me. I wish I weren't the kind of person that needed that sort of scare and discomfort to get back to treating myself with respect, but the message sunk in.

The inflammation has decreased significantly and all my blood and enzyme levels are back to normal ranges, so they sent me home. Now it's on me.

This was a total surprise, by the way, even though I'd been feeling some occasional discomfort in my chest and what I thought was my stomach. I eventually called 911 when it got so bad that I initially thought I was having a heart attack. I think a lot of alcoholics, especially young ones like me, chug along without worry as long as their liver is fine, and forget about how alcohol damages every single organ and bodily system in some way.

Don't just worry about your liver, and don't assume you're fine. If your drinking is out of control, do what you need to do. This could have killed me - I was told I was lucky by multiple doctors and that I came in not a moment too soon.

1mde93f,My body is rejecting alcohol... any experience?,"Not looking for medical advice, but similar experiences. I've had a love / hate relationship with alcohol for 20+ years (43 now), but for the most part I've been a heavy drinker my whole adult life. 3 - 4 beers a day minimum, on average, almost every day. In addition to the scattered binges or periods of heavier drinking.

In May of this year, I cut way back with the exception of a couple heavy drinking days. Long story short, about a week ago, I decided to have a couple beers. I cracked the first and immediately it was tough to even get a sip down. That was odd for me... I can usually kill a beer in 5 minutes without thinking about it. I sipped it for probably an hour and stopped myself, wondered why am I forcing this, and poured it out. Tried again a couple days later and same result. I've tried to drink 'a beer' probably 4 times over the past week... same result.

Today the thought of alcohol makes me nauseous. I'm fine with food, mineral water w/ lemon or lime, anything else I eat and drink, so it's not a generalized rejection of food or drink... just alcohol. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled and taking full advantage. But now I'm curious why the sudden change? Has anyone else experienced this?",1753899756.0,23,40,alcoholism,addiction
1mdxs91,Could use some advice,"
I need some real advice from experienced Vets here, I keep avoiding making this post because there is oh so much to type that it overwhelms me, I could type for hours about my story but that’s not something I want to do so i’m gonna do my best to break it down into a 5-10 min read. 

i’m 25M as of yesterday, I’m kicked out, living at a new house (which originally sucked but now things are quite good) I’m caught in a cycle of drinking everyday, wanting to quit, waking up, saying no i’m fine, drinking, working, back in the room saying I hate this I hate this I need rehab or something to stop the cycle, wake up, repeat. 

My body is so sick, my diet consists of cheetos, pizza, pop, 375ml bottle of smirnoff vodka, 16oz of red wine plus maybe 5 or 10 beers depending on the night, candy and orange juice to get the liquor down. 

I can’t even believe I can wake up and go to work everyday, some days i’m so physically ill that I feel the need to go the bathroom to puke but I hold it back and continue working.

It’s kind of miserable, but at the same time, maybe because I have ADHD, I enjoy the chaos, it’s a toxic cycle.

I’ve had stints where i’ve been sober for a year, or 4 months, or 6 months, those times are always the best times of my life. I can’t believe how happy I am. Obviously I have bad days, but I love life in those instances. When i’m caught in this addiction my mind tells me I need this and this is my life. 

It’s a very weird disease. I don’t understand it.

I don’t know how to stop this behaviour. I try to justify it by saying, i’m not at the bar beating people up, i’m not in jail, i’m not ruining my relationships, i’m not fired from work, but the reality is, in my experience, i’ve ruined everything. I’ve lost 6 girlfriends because of booze, my family has kicked me out 4 times (I slept in a tent in the woods at one point), I lost 7 jobs because of booze. I racked up 30k of debt, I spent the night in the drunk tank, only to realize I woke up and it’s mother’s day, spent another 3 times there, sometimes it hard and I feel like I have nothing. But I try to focus on the positives these days. 

Right now i’m cozy in my shitty mattress on the floor typing this but there’s just no end to this. I fear that I may do this until i’m 30, 40 or 50 etc. 

I want nothing more than to get sober and live as I should. This is my rant and thank you for reading if you got this far

1mdrmhm,Trying to get a better understanding of my partners perspective.,"I’ve asked some of these questions before but I’m just trying to get a better understanding of what it’s like to be a daily drinker. I have been with my partner for about 5 years. He’s 45 years old and has been drinking his entire adult life. I don’t know how heavy he used to drink, but people who know him tell me it has always been a lot. Since I’ve known him he’s been a daily drinker. Half to a fifth day. Usually half unless it’s a weekend or day off and then it can be more. I think he’s drinking more than I realize. I used to drink with him but stooped a few years ago, so now I’m more aware of how much and how drunk he is. He’s always been pretty good at hiding when he’s drunk, but either it’s affecting him more or I’m just noticing it more.

When I tell him drinking is a problem, it turns into an argument. He says the alcohol has nothing to do with our problems and isn’t causing any issue in his life. He is very functional. He works a ton and I don’t think he’s drinking while working unless he’s working from home. But again, I can’t be sure. He will hide the alcohol from me if I’ve been nagging about it a lot. If I stop bringing it up, he slowly stops hiding it as much. 

I can tell it’s changing his personality. He’s meaner, less caring, just seems to really dislike me. We do argue a lot but it’s mostly about the drinking and his lack of “presence and attention” even though he’s around me a lot. He has had issues performing since we met and I know it’s due to alcohol because the few times he hasn’t been drinking or isn’t super drunk yet, it works. He blames this on me too. Says he isn’t attracted because of the arguing or he’ll say he’s tired or not getting enough stimulation. Anything but the alcohol. He also becomes antagonistic when he’s drunk. He teases my dog and me and says it’s a “joke”. Tells me I don’t have a sense of humor or know what a joke is and I have a bad outlook on life. I’m actually healthier than I have been our entire relationship despite the fact that I’m lonely and feel fully dismissed and even ridiculed by him most of the time. He argues everything. Stupid stuff like refusing to not sit on the end of our expensive adjustable bed that I paid for, even though I’ve told him it can break it. We have the discussion almost nightly. I remind him not to sit on it and he tells me I worry too much and it’s fine and does it anyway. I remind him not to tease the dog and if I get annoyed then I’m “a bitch and want to make his life miserable”. Rinse and repeat and it’s like this about so many things. 

He has recently been drinking and driving with his nephew in the car. I told his sister and of course she didn’t believe me. She said she knows he drinks but she talked to him and knows he isn’t endangering her child. I don’t know why I even said anything because I knew that would be the likely outcome. But I just felt like I had to say something in case anything happened. Ever since I told her, he has been even more mean and withholds affection, which has always been an issue when he’s upset with me. I just feel like that was a huge mistake on my part. 

I finally started Al anon because I know I have to work on myself. It’s incredibly hard to leave due to finances but I’m accepting it may be my only option. 

I guess I just wonder how he must feel. Like he has to feel sick a lot with the amount he’s drinking right? I know he has diarrhea daily but he won’t admit it. Is it possible he doesn’t remember some nights or some of the arguments we’ve had? When I tell him things he has said to me he is adamant he never said them. I wonder if he’s blacking out. I also wonder how long it will be before something drastic happens with his health. He also smokes a lot and refuses to see a doctor for routine labs. 

Sorry, this is rambling. I didn’t mean for it to be so long. I’m just at such a loss and wondering what it’s like to be on his side of this. I love him and want to help him, but it seems like I’m the scapegoat for all of the problems in our lives and I don’t think he thinks he needs or wants help. ",1753934390.0,2,3,alcoholism,addiction

1md92rr,telling the truth,"Lately, I’ve been thinking about the dumb stuff I did before getting sober and want to get a few things off my chest, even anonymously. 

I continued to drink through 2 separate kidney infections and antibiotics in 2017. My doctor explicitly told me not to, but I ignored her because I wanted to drink. The pain was horrible, but I did it anyway (and I didn’t think I had a problem???). I’m extremely lucky I didn’t end up hospitalized or dead. I told everyone my doctor said it was fine to drink, although looking back I doubt anyone believed that. 

I was blacked out drunk when I fell and got a concussion back in 2019. I still can’t remember what happened, but it’s because of the alcohol and not the concussion. I lied to the medical staff, my friends, and my family and told them I hadn’t been drinking. Deep down I knew my drinking was bad by that point, and I couldn’t bring myself to be honest because I was afraid I’d be forced to stop. 

There are more, but these are the things that have been bothering me the most. It’s sad to think about how little I cared about myself, my health, and the people around me. The crazy part is, I barely thought anything of it at the time. Somehow, I thought what I was doing was normal and okay. Denial is a hell of a drug and I’m happy to be sober now.

1mcvk8y,Finally Accepting She Chose Alcohol Over Me,"After four years of supporting my wife and her children—through job losses, instability, and countless second chances—I’ve finally come to terms with something that’s been breaking me for a long time: she chose alcohol over me.

She got sober twice. For a few short months each time, I had an amazing partner and we had an amazing relationship. I held onto that version of her, hoping it would stick. I kept believing that my love, my loyalty, and all the sacrifices I made would be enough. But the truth is… they weren’t.

She always found her way back to the bottle. Back to the lies, the nastiness, and the blame. Nothing was ever her fault. She had no self-awareness, and I kept hoping for someone who was only ever pretending.

At 41, after years of this cycle, I finally realized it’s never going to change—and I don’t deserve to live like this anymore.

I find myself craving it often, especially after a long or stressful day, or even out of boredom when I’m looking for a dopamine hit. If I lived alone, I could easily see myself drinking it daily. My fiancé has noticed my increased consumption, though I still consider myself functional—I work full time, I don’t drink and drive, and I meet my responsibilities.

But I’ve also noticed a pattern: I reach for wine when I’m sad, angry, bored, or even celebrating. It’s become a go-to in every emotional state. And even though it sometimes makes me feel physically unwell—and I tell myself I’ll take a break or stop altogether—I keep coming back to it.

It’s specifically wine that feels like it has a hold on me. I know alcoholism runs in my family, which makes me wonder: Is this something I should be concerned about? And if so, do you have any recommendations on how to manage or shift this?

Would it be silly or over-the-top to consider going to AA meetings, even though I’m completely functional but just can’t seem to stop or limit myself to only one glass occasionally?

1mchb0e,Hello people. I’m 70 days sober today!,"I have been doing like a sort of blog to track my progress and to hopefully help anyone going through things. Someone left a comment on one of my videos saying that if I were a real alcoholic, I would’ve needed medication to quit. ""You were never an alcoholic"" 

I drank 8 to 10 beers a night, every night, for 20 years. I held down a job and looked “functional.” But that doesn’t mean I wasn’t stuck in a bad cycle. The idea that you have to be drinking bottles of vodka or waking up in a ditch to count as an alcoholic is a bad one and I think it keeps people from getting the help they need. 

Im not hurting anyone by admitting I was an alcoholic to myself to help me to change anyway.

1mcp7zu,Incredibly upset with my alcoholic friend who gave up on detox/rehab after 5 days,"Nearly 7 year alcoholic drinking at least a fifth a day, if not closer to two… last Thursday he finally took the leap to go into detox for the first time and today checked himself out due to a “conflict” with his therapist and that he didn’t “feel like he belonged” there with those people or in a program like that. Before he even went in he was adamant on only doing the detox to get sober, but I figured he would have lasted longer to find more support.

I’ve had my own bout with addiction years ago, specifically benzos, and found myself in a drug induced psychosis for a week and in rehab for 2-3 weeks shortly after. I know the struggle addiction brings for oneself, and those around them. I also know the amount of bullshit one can and will feed themselves about their addiction, and what led up to it if it means not facing themselves. On top of that, I grew up with an alcoholic father who spewed the same shit he has about getting and staying sober, only to become a worse alcoholic.

And that’s where I’m stuck. When he spoke with me this morning he kept feeding me shit on how all he needed was to get the detox out of the way to get sober and that he’s got it under control. I kept telling him it is almost never that simple for any sort of addict - there is always a lead up to the addiction, such as trauma, triggers, etc. which he acknowledged, and then proceeded to list everything that happened only during his active addiction, nothing before, and then told me to drop it. I’ve been in years of therapy to unfold most of this not only in myself, but see it in others too.

At this point I’m over it. I’m proud he did something he never did before, but I’m also incredibly irritated that he thinks that’s it. He won’t do therapy or any sort of support groups and I’m over it. All day today he has had this upbeat and happy demeanor towards me and I cannot take it. On top of that I made a three day effort to declutter his alcoholic hoarder home and he never acknowledged it. I feel like my support and efforts to help him have just been entirely shit on.

I feel so pissed yet I want to be supportive. Fuck.",1753827153.0,3,5,alcoholism,addiction

Acamprosate

My uncle (65) has been sober for about a year now. He’s really trying to stay on track, but it’s been tough at times and I know he’s slipped up here and there. The main reason? Boredom.

His routine is pretty structured: he wakes up super early, works all day, finishes with a workout, then has dinner and watches tv. After that, there’s this awkward window of time before bed that he struggles to fill. He’s usually too tired for extra work or hobbies at that point, and in the past, he’d always have a drink after his workout as a “reward.”

I live in a different state, so I can't visit him each week easily. I was thinking of sending him a book with mocktail recipes, but I’d love to hear other ideas that could help or support him during those moments. What’s worked for you or your loved ones in similar situations?

My health was bad and I had massive anxiety. First few days I swapped to beers (mikes) only and felt better and have worked my way to now only two beers a night/two nights a week. Obviously I feel way better, anxiety has mostly gone away, and I’m way more focused and productive like I used to be. But those are more obvious things.

I wanted to share a little thing that happened today. On a day off In the past, I would start drinking as soon as I woke up and by 6 pm I’d be drunk drunk.

Today I haven’t drank at all and I went outside to take out my trash and I saw my car outside. 

I got a huge smile on my face thinking, “it’s 6:30 pm and I could get in my car and drive anywhere around town, and it would be completely safe and legal”.

She was addicted for a couple of years then once she got better she got sober- not fully sober, she still drank, but in more ‘normal amounts’. Recently, she’s been drinking a lot more than usual- not the level she used to, but still a significant increase from the ‘normal amount’.

Then learned about tapering, and have done some substitution stuff to try to taper - moving to wine, 2-3 bottles a day, which i would drink mixed with water and ice throughout the day, and sometimes to a mixture of wine and either beer or hard seltzer either water or not and ice. And i have done 1.5-2 bottles of wine as i try to reduce. Then this past weekend I decided to stop. I went Saturday and Sunday pretty easy, just fatigue and no motivation but super stoked to be quitting. Woke up day 3 and felt good, better every day the last two days. But around 1:30 or so, probably about 42 hours from my last drink, i got super bad drop off and got scared. I figured i went too cold turkey. So i had a 8 pack of some 5% hard tea on hand so decided i needed to go slower. I drank a couple, felt better, then as i started getting agitated and feeling wd starting to come back on, couple hours later gad a couple more. Then hour an hour or so later felt it again, and over the next 5 hours or so I polished off the other 4. Not buzzed, just staving off the worst of wd. 

So my question - i'm just scared. Am I supposed to just avoid the worst of it and try to go longer between drinks? My concern is the idea of kindling. Since I've experienced pretty significant wd drop off, how do I approach this? How do I allow myself to go to sleep? What the heck? Should i just get a buzz before bed and if i can't sleep, if it gets dicey middle of the night, just have a drink to blunt the onset?

I(44F) have been with my partner (45 m) for 3 yrs. He is an alcoholic. Jim Beam nips and beer. His issue developed within the last two yrs. He admitted his drinking has impacted his sexual performance. Sometimes we can be intimate if he's been drinking, but barely. I understand alcohol impacts performance for men while drinking. However recently he began turning down sex the morning after when he's sober. And before anyone suggests, I know he's not cheating. He has the most predictable schedule ever. From work to immediately home. Any of the red flags you'd see with cheating isn't there. Plus I trust him. I became self-conscious taking the rejection personally and that he wasn't interested in me. I finally asked what was wrong and why he declines sex when he's been sober lately. His response was he's ok, and nothing is wrong. Basically blowing the issue off. I didn't want to keep pushing it. But I do plan to address it again eventually. My question is, can alcoholism impact performance even when sober? Not sure if this is relevant, but he's not at the stage where abstaining from drinking causes shakes. And he has reduced the amount of liquor the last few weeks. It just has me feeling very insecure right now.

1mbnava,"The end of an era, but a new beginning","New to the thread as of today. It has been a long time coming for me to quit drinking. I had my last drink on 7/26/25. So this is my 2nd day. I have tried quitting before, but this time I feel super committed. Saturday, 7/26/25, was a really bad drinking day for me. I went to a concert (Warped Tour) and got incredibly wasted. I was with my wife and friends. I ended up blacking out for most of the concert. Not what I had originally planned, but alcohol doesn't care about your plans, so I've learned. I made a complete fool of myself which I have done countless times. I have been really thinking about quitting drinking for good. I have a great life, happily married with 3 beautiful young children. I didn't have the best childhood, coming from drug drug-addicted father and a bad divorce. I mostly just shut it off and don't really think about it, but anyway this to me was the last time and it's time to quit. I am an alcoholic drinking whiskey on a daily basis. I ignored all the tell signs and just told myself lies and continued to drink on a daily basis. Drinking would occupy my thoughts daily. I would think "" Do I have any whiskey to make it through the night?"" I even started to have to go to different stores so people wouldn't think I was such a raging alcoholic. Then it got really bad. I started hiding whiskey in misc. normal day things and hide a flasks, etc. I was also buying whiskey on my lunch break and making a drink when I was leaving work so I would be drinking and driving everyday. (NOT GOOD). Coming from a childhood where I was around drugs, drinking every day, seeing it from my father, I do not want to repeat the cycle and make a change. The last thing I want my kids to remember is a drunk father who always has a drink in his hand. Last night was pretty bad, I had really bad sweats and started hallucinating and hearing things. I only got a couple of hours of sleep before heading to work. I know this is going to be a roller coaster and not an easy thing to do. I am committed this time around! Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for all the typo's, my spelling is garbage.

  
Also, I cleared out my entire house of booze yesterday. ",1753725378.0,10,19,alcoholism,addiction
1mbsr2i,First time in medical detox - advice greatly appreciated!,"Hello friends.  Alcoholic here.  I am a 28 year old who has been suffering from alcoholism for 10 years, and has spent the last 9 of those years without health insurance (parents died when I was young, that's kind of how the drinking kicked off, and I lost my health insurance when that happened).  Thankfully, I finally acquired great health insurance through my partner and will be entering medical detox soon as a result.  I know it's going to be hard, but I am so beyond grateful to be going.  My reasons for creating this post are because, if you're willing to share, I'm curious to know: for those of you who have been through medical detox, what would you let your fellow alcoholic know in advance?  What item(s) would you bring that you didn't think to bring when you went?  What emotional tools would you want to instill in someone that you wish you could have had going in?

1mbtpd3,Help for SO who drinks to sleep,"

Hi, I am a 31 years old man and I would say that I am an addic from 15yo. First it was weed then booze, then alcohol then booze, then alcohol, then weed till I quit definitely weed and turn to alcohol and its been … 5 years I think. The reason it all started was I can’t sleep and I need something to sleep… 
From when I was really young till now, sleep has always been a problem and nothing worked. 
Wether I hiked for ten days without alcohol or cigarettes while while walking with a 20kg backpack and so on on .. sleep is never easy… that’s is why in my head; I have this this routine that helps sleep…
I have started to drink to sleep.
I want to stop but when I try, I can’t sleep at all, I sweat a lot like it’s raining … I tried watching movies, musics, reading, etc 
If my body doesn’t have what it should have I can’t sleep … I am starting to wonder if sleeping pills can help? 
I never feel the urge to drink, I wake up, I see relatives drinking all day and I don’t mind. I don’t want to drink alcohol, it is just like in need to sleep. 
Has anyone had the help of sleeping pills that helped them ?

1mbicgx,Alcohol and shame,"Hey there. I'm trying to do some self-development and understand my patterns to help with my alcohol consumption. I don't drink everyday, but I'm a binge drinker. I've gotten better over the years but still, if I let my guard down and don't closely monitor myself, I will drink to the point where I black out. This has lead me to using drugs to try and slow down my alcohol intake. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it has landed me into having 2 addiction problems to deal with and has intensified my anxiety and how much shame I feel after going on a bender.

Something I recently learned about shame is that it's an emotion that is supposed to make you stop a behaviour. But I don't understand why it's not helping me to stop drinking so much. I wake up the next day having panic attacks, feeling like a garbage person and being scared to death someone is gonna tell me I did something unforgivable while blacked out. And then I go out and do it all again.

I juste moved to a new area where I don't know many people. This weekend I had the chance to go out and get introduced to my roomate's friends. I drank too much and blacked out. She told me it was fine and I was in a good mood, I didn't do anything wrong. Still I'm scared people saw that and are not gonna want to associate with me because of how intense I was the first time they met me, when in regular life I'm a pretty discrete and chill person. I wouldn't blame them for this choice, but it would sadden me.

I know there's no easy solution, I think I'm just hoping for some encouragement and trying not to sit alone with this feeling. I've read a few articles that say it helps to talk about it with others, but I don't want to be a burden to my circle so I figured I would start here.",1753714428.0,10,7,alcoholism,addiction

I was at a wedding last weekend and I decided on purpose to drink there. I overdid it obviously, blacked out, I am afraid I did stuff I would be incredibly ashamed of if I knew it, might have ruined relationships etc. And the next day I needed to continue drinking because when I woke up I felt that I am still drunk.

1mbpj34,People asking me for advice on quitting.,"I've been asked, a couple of times now, how I've managed to stop drinking so abruptly. Short answer for context: Acute and nearly deadly liver failure from alcohol, and off the charts cirrhosis that means alcohol will kill me very,very quickly indeed. That's a motivator.  
  
So the leadup:

Last night I was working the bar at a wedding. Lots of booze, lots of drunk people.

A guy I happen to know, let's call him Wee Geoff, came to me and said ""Hey, TDD. You're alive!""

TDD: Yeah! It was fucking close, but I made it. Is that the rumour going around SmallVillage, that I died?  
WG: Aye, more than a few people think that!  
TDD: WTF?? No, I'm still here! (briefest possible summary of my health troubles, a fine art now).  
WG: Sounds bloody scary. So what pills are you taking?  
TDD: None, mate.  
WG: Nothing? Jesus, that must be tough! Especially with all this booze lying around.  
TDD: Not as bad as you'd think, actually. It's a lot easier with a gun to your head.  
WG: I'm asking cos I want to ask you about stopping drinking, too. I just can't seem to.  


Now, at this point, the mood has completely changed. Geoff has gone from garrulous to almost pleading, in a few seconds. If it wasn't in public, I think he might have cried.

He told me he's tried to give up over the last few days, but only managed 3 days. I said ""well, that's still a thing! Well done. Is it the wedding that made you drink again?"" and he replied that it was only an excuse, really, that the three days had been \*horrible\* and he'd spent every day feeling anxious and thinking of nothing more than his first pint at the do.

He went on to ask more about pills, whether I got help from the doctor here (we go to the same practice - USAians, ask if you don't know what that means), and other things. His, non-drinking, girlfriend joined us, and let slip that Geoff had actually been looking forward to the wedding so that he could speak to me about this! I must confess I was quite flattered!

So I gave him the ""One day at a time"" advice, and then stopped myself from saying ""Give me a call tomorrow, and let me know how you're getting on"".

It's a small town, and I don't want to become known as TDD the alchie-whisperer. Neither, though, do I want to hear Geoff tell me, next time I see him, that he's still struggling when I \*could\* be that guy, The guy he phones at 3am to say ""I did it"" or ""Hell I failed, I think I'm a loser"".

But if I offer that to him, I'd need to offer it to everyone who came to me with a drink problem. Geoff isn't the first and he won't be the last in a town like this.

Thoughts - what's the correct way to approach this? I want to help others, to be that shoulder, but I do also need to reserve energy for me and my own fight.",1753730272.0,4,7,alcoholism,addiction

1mbgaua,5 days sober after relapse,"So I am 5 days sober after a relapse from 8 days sober. What made me want to start again was I was in a femdom discord server and made a fool of myself. I didn't say anything offensive but the incident made me extremely depressed because the host would make jokes at my expense and I became the laughingstock of the community. Eventually I just left because it was toxic and the host would often flirt with the members, which I'm not sure if it's a power embalance or not. I've grown to only feel attracted to dominant women and sometimes it makes me wish the toxic ones liked me. The loneliness I feel has been connected to my drinking because I feel trapped like I can never feel sexually and socially fulfilled. I sometimes feel resentment for being a masochistic man and having no female love and fulfillment.

I will try my best to remain sober despite those self destructive thoughts. Whenever I'm sober I get constant feelings of suicide but I want to try my best to not give up. Hopefully 2 weeks. I have only been drinking for 3 months total so I think I can do it.",1753709602.0,6,11,alcoholism,addiction
1mbr6zq,An I worrying for no reason?,"I’d like to preface this my saying I don’t view myself as better or worse than anyone else here, and thank you in advance for the responses. I’ve had an interesting relationship with alcohol the past few years. Since the beginning of 2023, when I was in the military, I drank roughly 6 nights a week. It usually consisted of me and my friend splitting a 12 pack. Sometimes we’d have more than that on the weekends, sometimes we’d split a handle of something hard. On very rare occasions, I’d find myself drinking about 375ml of liquor alone. This went on for about 2 years. 

I never drank in the morning before work, was never late, excelled at my job, it never impacted my friendships, relationships, etc. Nonetheless, I fully understand that waking up for work most days hungover is an unhealthy relationship with alcohol that does not lead to better things. One night I happened to read about the dangers of alcohol withdrawals, and the rare possibility of seizures. This scared me enough to stop drinking immediately. Besides my absurd anxiety convincing myself I was going to have a seizure every other minute, I didn’t have any noticeable withdrawals. No trouble sleeping, no shakes, no sweating, not even cravings. Again, other than extreme anxiety about a possible seizure that I don’t even think I was at risk for, no withdrawals.

Fast forward a couple months of no drinking. I got out of the military, and drank very socially on the weekends. Never during the week anymore. I felt amazing. I recently went on a trip with a few friends where we went on a bender for 4 days. I don’t know what to make of it. I had a blast, definitely drank more than I should, but again had no trouble stopping besides my own anxiety. 

I’m at the point where I’m scared to have a drink again because I fear a rekindle event. That’s where I think my anxiety is getting the better of me. Again, I recognize I had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. However, I really don’t believe I was at a level where the withdrawal I was worried about was possible. So now here I am. I’d like to continue socially drinking on the weekends. However, I have this fear that  one night I might have too much fun with my friends which will cause my anxiety to skyrocket. I’ll be in fear of a seizure for a week even though I know it’s not realistic

I guess I’m in a weird boat where I’m wondering if anyone else has a similar experience. I definitely struggle with health anxiety. It’s just weird because here’s how I look at it: I was definitely drinking much more than the healthy recommendation a week. However, I still think there was a major gap between my level and a level of dependency such as having to wake up every 4 hours to take shots to stop the shakes (again no judgment). I was able to stop easily with no symptoms expect my crippling anxiety. I know anxiety can be a withdrawal symptom. However I don’t think this was from alcohol, but rather my own mind overthinking everything and convincing myself I’m going to die. Now I fear that even one beer will send me down a spiral. Not one of being unable to control my drinking, but one of living in constant fear of anxiety about withdrawals and rekindles that I’ve never had anyway.

I know an easy answer is to just never drink again, which I’m considering. I would just like to be able to go to dinner and have a glass of wine or even a little more fun occasionally without being in fear for the following week. I’m not scared of a situation where 1 beer turns in 15 and I’m blackout drunk, I’ve never blacked out and can control when I stop. Most of my drinking came from boredom to be honest. Sorry I’m all over the place. Just looking for thoughts on this. Thank you. ",1753734049.0,2,0,alcoholism,addiction

Life is so much calmer right now. I am at peace with not drinking ever. I just tell people “I don’t drink” and don’t delve into details. I have picked up new hobbies to fill up my calendar. Headaches still happen but now I don’t think they’re alcohol related. I have problems with falling asleep still. I can’t fall asleep before midnight and as a result I sleep only 6-7 hours a night, when I managed more with alcohol. My brain hasn’t readjusted yet so I haven’t felt good. My mood is quite the same over the days, but I’m looking forward to the first natural dopamine hit. I don’t really have urges, so I stopped “tracking” my progress - I used to sit down at the end of the day and write how I felt, any cravings, what I was doing for my accountability but I kinda gave up, so I’m forcing myself to do it again.

1mbayjz,this post is an opportune time to make fun of gen z,"im afraid guys. like actually. I’m only 22 yet have severely suffered from addiction since 15. as the years have passed I’ve become more wise and accustomed to these impulses while simultaneously I have become completely helpless and useless to my addictive tendencies.

the attention from being the problem child and source of entertainment in this small town is not contributing to my sobriety. realistically the next 3 months are the only times I’m the near future I can actually do this for myself.

I’ll be real I’m fucking scared. i had a mental epiphany recently which I perceived to be the final motivating factor to get clean from everything yet despite fully comprehending exactly how drugs are affecting my life I literally cannot stop.

i’ve chalked up past failures to get sober due to ‘young age’ ‘immaturity’ ‘lack of motivation’ etc etc.

perhaps I didn’t fully grasp the meaning of ‘addiction’.

I thought of it more as a fundamental lack of self discipline and everything else that accompanies a stereotypical addict.

but guys this addiction thing isn’t that for me and likely most of us.

and as much as I want to contribute to positive and motivating content here I just can’t.

i have tried so much in these past 7 years to be normal.

i can’t accep it for me me to chalk my life and my circumstances to potential parenting mistakes and other circumstances when I was younger.

it feels like despite whatever I could’ve been given growing up I would have always have had this abnormality in my brain.

awareness of the statistics on addiction and recovery only enforce this thinking in my brain.

i don’t know the purpose of this post. i don’t necessarily need specific tips on how to get sober or anything related. i just want to vent how much I hate truly being an “addict”

today I have fully realized I can’t just stop even when I ‘really want to’

This label isn’t a romantic excuse of temporary behaviors I indulged in in times of stress while being immature. it has been a core part of me since I can remember. this addictive tendency has clearly been expressed in any dopaminergic medium I’ve indulged in throughout my life.

1makvlw,Almost 10 months sober- my journey,"Hey everyone,

I 26m never thought I’d be here writing this post. 10 months ago, on October 3rd, 2024, I had my last drink. On October 4th, I walked into rehab for the first time in my life. I was broken, angry, and honestly scared of what my life had become. Alcohol owned me. I thought it was my escape, but it was really a prison.

Fast forward to today: I’m 10 months sober, working a job where I get to help homeless people, and I’m engaged to someone who stuck by me when she had every reason to walk away. I’m also expecting my first child soon

It hasn’t been easy. I’ve had days where the cravings screamed, nights where my mind told me I’d never make it, and moments where I wanted to burn everything down. But, I kept fighting. I learned to sit with my feelings instead of drowning them. I found faith in something bigger than me, and I’m not talking about a big man in the sky. I mean faith in the rooms, faith that attending can help restore us to sanity. I believe each of us has a purpose, albeit very complicated ones that can’t really be defined by anyone but you

For the first time in years, I feel like I’m becoming the man I was always meant to be

1mb6s02,My boyfriend has a lying problem,"I need help, and idk where else to post this. I’ve recently discovered that my boyfriend has a lying problem or habit and I’m wondering if this is related to his drinking since he’s trying to be a recovering alcoholic. I’ve been with him for a little over a year now and this all just hurts. This is the first time he has ever gotten angry at me and took it out on me. I’ll start from the beginning, I’ve known him long distance for about 8 years. Flirting occasionally back and forth, but besides that I consider him one of the few people that I could turn too for any  situation and he’d talk to me about it. A year before he moved in with his sibling he had told me the he had real feelings for me and was lucky that he didn’t propose to me. With how our friendship was and how I knew of him at the time this was very very sweet of him. To be honest I liked him too but I was struggling with my own family situation so i declined because he deserved a healthier me than that current me. I moved out of my toxic family’s house and got on the road to becoming healthier. I stopped using meth for fun permanently, and started looking into my own mental health more since leaving my family for the first time (I was 25 at the time) it was a struggle for a bit to not want to run back home. I got a two bedroom apartment and was on the path of healing when I found out that he was longer states away. We hung out a few times and the next thing I know was that we were in a relationship. He moved in eventually because his sibling was tired of his drinking and leaving cans of beer everywhere. His favorite are the tall ones. So we’ve together for a while so I told him that he can move in. I figured that if it didn’t work out then we can at least be roommates. I’m usually friends with my ex’s if it ended on good terms and I have a spare bedroom. Soon enough however I found out how bad his drinking was…. It affected his first job when he moved here leading to being fired for drinking on the job, and then his second job was catching on. It started affecting me at work. I had to leave early because the landlord was coming over with an inspector to do the yearly inspection. My boyfriend called me about a situation that lead to him being in jail and then being let out once he sobered up. He said that he had gotten attacked on his way home and was beaten up. I found out later that it was more than likely a lie. This is when I told him that he needs to figure out he needs to do to get sober because his drinking was affecting everyone who cared about him and his life. He agreed even though he was irritated. He tired doing it on his own and promised that he’d go to rehab if it didn’t work. He ended up needing detox, but then came back home thinking he was better better later stopped taking his meds and started drinking again and tried to dumbly lie about it (i found a full can in his bag). He ended up going back for two months and was spoken to about going to a halfway house. He came back home on our anniversary, which I was so happy to see him. He was doing so good for two weeks and was helping me around the house more than he ever has. He was doing so much better mentally and was happy. At the end of the two weeks he had a beer next to him while he was asleep. Admittedly I had a hard conversation with him about how he should invite his kiddo over since I haven’t met him and he hasn’t since before the first confrontation of his drinking. This led into a not happy conversation. Then I came home from work and he was like this. I work the night shift this whole time. When he drinks he just hates himself and is so depressed. I told him again that he needed to do what he needed too to get well. He said he went to a meeting but not at a time that’s available online, we have posting online where we live about times of each meeting and where. Eventually this lead to a situation a week or two later where I discovered a bag of his favorites in a dumpster. Now I know that it could have been anyone’s but it also had my very specific creamer in it. I asked him about it and another bag of his favorites in our trash can outside. His final answer was that they both are old from the basement where he use to hide them. Okay this made sense to me to a point. He had told me he threw out some old ones he found in the basement but that was the first week of being back. But there’s two bags in different locations. At this point he’s telling his parents, siblings, and friends that in his perspective that I’m going around accusing him for no reason. And his family didn’t know who to believe or his friends. I understand that his story makes me sound very toxic, in a sense I felt pretty crazy too. Going to trash and dumpsters. I ended up letting it go until a week later I found a tall beer next to my monthly stuff. I’ve had my time of the month twice since he’s been out of rehab and I know I would have noticed that beer since I was looking for some cleaner that we were out of the week prior. He answered the same as before that he was sober and hadn’t had a sip of alcohol since then and was proud of himself. That he wasn’t going to admit to something that he didn’t do. I know that beer hasn’t been there before. I would have seen it while he was in rehab and throw it out, it was right in the front. Impossible to miss. I let it go but kept my eyes peeled for evidence something else hoping to crack through this denial and provide evidence to his family of the truth. They want to stop drinking just as much as me and get well. At this point in time his family did agree that it was suspicious. I had wanted to talk to his sponsor for the first time but instead he told me that he had just found out the his sponsor OD and was brain dead in the hospital. Again another coincidence. I took a picture of his medication because I know he hasn’t been taking it so I’m time stamping his bottle. He lied to me on the phone that he took it in the morning but he’s suppose to take it twice a day and it was three days ago when I took the first picture. He didn’t have an answer. He lied about giving his sister 60$ to get us groceries, she told me herself that he never gave her money. This lead to the worst fight we’ve ever had, he was raising his voice at me and threw his wallet at my direction, he said he had the 60$ in there and it wasn’t, he said it was in another wallet, it wasn’t. I asked him to help me find it and he said no. So there’s my answer that it’s gone. He threw a bag of food down on the ground in front of me. Just repeatedly saying how he was done with me and should have listened to his family and friends about how he should have left me. His family believes me and has told me that he has always had a lying problem and would tell stories that have never happened. I’ve told his friends and they told me to leave them out of it because they were tired of being brought into our problems. Now he’s sleeping on the couch and idk what to do, his siblings don’t want him back if he’s still drinking which we both feel that that’s what’s happening. Idk what to do he doesn’t have anywhere else to go. I love him and want him to get help, he’s currently nothing like the man I’ve known for 8 years or feels like the man I’ve been with for a year. Idk what to do or if there’s a better group to post too for advice. I love this man and he makes me happy outside of these situations. Idk what to do and kicking him out to be homeless feels so wrong to me. Idk what to do or say to snap him out of this. ",1753676699.0,0,16,alcoholism,addiction
1ma7vrw,For those throwing stones at people in recovery,"I’ve seen the comments below —people tearing down others for posting selfies or celebrating early milestones. Words like “attention w****” being thrown at folks who are simply trying to feel alive again.

Let me be clear:
There is nothing shameful about being proud of 2 days, 15 days, or 50 years!!
There is nothing wrong with showing your face after years of hiding in addiction, shame, or silence.
There is nothing wrong with seeking connection, community, or a little light on the darkest days.

And if someone finds joy, validation, or encouragement in posting a photo—they should post it proudly!

You don’t have to like every post. You don’t have to engage. But tearing people down while they’re trying to rebuild? That’s not honesty—it’s cruelty. And it says more about your pain than theirs.

This space is supposed to be about support, not superiority.
If you can’t lift someone up, well....thats your journey 

We’re all fighting demons. Some of us are choosing to fight them in the light. That takes guts—not vanity.

To those still showing up with love: you are what makes this space worth it.
To the rest: I truly hope you find peace. But I won’t let your bitterness define my healing.

1man16f,Start singing,"Even if you suck at singing. Singing allows you to express pent up stress energy, while also working your vagus nerve, which relaxes you. If you have a car and you're embarrassed to sing in the house because of other people, go sing in the car. 

I've found it's a great distraction and outlet for me. And something to work and build towards. I'm not much of a dancer, but I think that'd be a great outlet, too which would give you some exercise and might get rid of cravings. Relaxing the body, getting tension out. 

In any case, you might find that some kind of creative pursuit is a great healing outlet for you. At the same time helping to fight against boredom. Singing, drawing, graphic design, calligraphy, playing guitar, jewelry modding, journaling, I've done a lot of different things. There is so much you can do for almost no money. 

Singing brings me a joy that I can't explain. Try to find some creative spark inside you. Anything that takes the energy inside you and puts it outside. I always found it very draining to do nothing but consuming sports, social media, video games, self-help, etc.

I broke up with him several years ago, partially because his drinking had become bad enough that I was noticing it. I didn’t want to raise my kids around that, as I grew up in a family of alcohlics. I had confronted him about it a few years before we broke up. I offered to help or support him any way I could. He just started hiding it better, at first, but then it worsened. He was urinating on our furniture. He would pass out on the couch and hiss at me if I tried to get him to come to bed with me. He eventually was driving around with my kids after drinking. There was no sex life. I didn’t enjoy being around him anymore. One night he pissed all over my bathroom floor, didn’t clean it, didn’t apologize, and acted like I was blowing things out of proportion when I called him out for it. So I ended things. I tried to remain friendly. I kept his cat for him for a month while he went to inpatient rehab. His animosity toward me after that worsened to the point that I cut off all ties to him, and eventually my family all did the same. Things got very bad after that, and apparently he never stopped drinking. His landlord called the police for a welfare check and they found him dead. He had been there at least a couple of weeks. He had family but would refuse to answer their calls and messages, so nobody knew what was going on. I saw pictures from the house, and it was COVERED in empty vodka bottles and trash.

1masmba,Debunking Alcohol Myths: What Your Health Journey Needs to Know,"Hey everyone,

I just read an insightful article on ""Alcohol Myths: Debunking Misconceptions"" from Pathway to a Healthy Lifestyle, and it really shifts perspective on what we think we know about alcohol and our bodies. It’s not about judgment, but about informed choices for a truly healthy life.

Here are a few key takeaways that might surprise you, directly from the article:

* **Not a Source of Strength:** Despite common belief, alcohol doesn't provide genuine energy or strength. It depletes your vital power, leading to a net weakening of your system.
* **No Aid to Digestion:** Far from helping, alcohol actually hinders digestion. It's often a root cause of issues like indigestion, flatulence, and acidity, forcing your body to expend energy just to eliminate it.
* **Impact on Circulation & Temperature:** Alcoholic ""medicines"" or drinks don't increase body heat or improve circulation in a healthy way. Instead, they cause a disturbance that can mimic fever, ultimately reducing overall circulation and healthy temperature.
* **Dietary Link:** The article highlights a connection between higher meat consumption and increased alcohol cravings, suggesting that a natural diet of fruits, nuts, and vegetables doesn't trigger such desires.

Understanding these points is crucial if you're on a journey towards a truly vibrant and healthy lifestyle. It really makes you rethink common habits.

Up until about yesterday when he bought a case. I was naive in thinking he’d have one or two and that would be about it. Came home after hanging out with some friends after work to see he had that case whilst I was asleep and had bought another during the day while I was at work and had even more. 

He had been slowly killing himself for 20+ years. then suddenly it caught up with him and he finally stopped. Then once he starts improving he starts again. 

I’ve been traumatized by him whilst he was drunk. Threatening me and the rest of my family. Asking me inappropriate questions. Watching him wither away from depression further exasperated by his alcoholism after my mother left him. Using me as a support mentally since I was 16 years old (I.E telling me about his marriage problems while extremely drunk)

I love my dad but I don’t think I can do it again. His health spiraled about a year ago now and if he relapses again he very well could die. Should I come up with an ultimatum? Or just gently confront him in his seeming relapse.

Her attitude towards alcohol has always been very casual - it's what all adults including her, should be able to drink any time if they want. She's a lightweight and can't handle much. She doesn't drink when she has to work. So she has some control. But when she does drink, she will drink excessively until she passes out. Usually when she feels any strong emotions (happy, cheerfulness, sadness, anger, etc.) 
She's able to justify her alcohol consumption because everything she's been through in life, and that she doesn't drink everyday, and it's not as much as other people. Because of that she doesn't count as an alcoholic.
I don't know much about alcohol addiction. So in this group about this subject, for people who have more experience, is she an alcoholic?

I knew something was wrong but, she did not care to tell me and I wasn't going to force it out of her. I did told her she needed to stop drinking. Well, she basically did not tell me during that whole time, but today I found out, well she told me, that shes been diagnosed with liver failure since February of this year; because of years of alcohol abuse. 

I told her last time I saw her to stop drinking, she never listened, she now has yellow eyes at 40, she also retaining water. She is currently doing laboratory exams and is on observation. Her doctor says shes young so there is still chance for her to recover, either that or a liver transplant. She has stopped drinking completely. I did not know this until literaly today. I'm not sure why she agreed to see me in a bar. Force of habit most likely. 

I am extremely worried for her and I am not sure if shes ever going to recover, or how much time do I have left with her.

We sat at the bar for 5 hours without drinking a single drop of alcohol. People around us drinking and partying, hard. I spent 5 hours just talking with her. Catching up, asking everything about it and how is she functioning. Shes still sound of mind at least. Conversations are still elocuent, smart, full of humor, etc. At least shes ok in that aspect.

I am not sure what to write beyong this. I'm just in shock, in disbelief.",1753508683.0,17,7,alcoholism,addiction
1ma3u7l,I need advice on a guy I am dating,"A recently started dating a guy a couple of weeks ago. I know he has a history of alcoholism and alcohol abuse. Sometimes when we are texting and I know he is drinking, sometimes he will start saying extremely blunt things. I voiced toward the start of the relationship that I want to wait a while before doing anything intimate. He told me he is totally fine with waiting. Today I was telling him that I was nervous for us to kiss. Because I like him a lot.  He said “wow if you are that nervous about kissing what would it take for you to sleep with me?” He said he never got nervous with kissing or sexual stuff. I googled if it is normal to get nervous before a kiss, and it said it was. I sent him a screenshot and was like, hey this is what the internet said about it. He replied with “Hey why don’t you google: Is mike gonna lose interest?” And mike is his name. Any advice? I have a suspicion it is because of alcohol that he responded this way but i also just don’t know what to think cuz i was never expecting him to talk to me like this.",1753562716.0,0,31,alcoholism,addiction

I went on a trip to see a friend and had a few drinks one of the nights. I felt no desire after that until I showed back up to work. I work as a CO and one of the inmates decided to purposefully overdose because he was never going to get put of prison because of his age. Since that day it's all I wanted to do. I've wanted to just not think about it. I know there was nothing I could have done, he made up his mind well before he bought the drugs. 

It's the only thing that's been on my mind. Tonight I decided to go out and have a couple drinks, but i ended up drinking way more than I even planned on. I have continued to feel like I need to drink again so I can stop thinking about it. I've spoken to my thearpist about it and it just didn't help me. I've had dreams about it, how i could have possibly helped. I just keep thinking about how he felt there was nothing else there, just like I think about lot of us have felt. I truly get it for him. He was going to die in prison or die in the streets, he was too old there's no other way with his age. 

I just want to know how you guys might handle this. Because I know I'll mess up worse than I already have. I've been good for so long, I haven't even thought about touching the bottle on much fridge that's been there for almost a year now. ",1753528282.0,5,5,alcoholism,addiction

1m9aipq,1+ years sober! 🎆 Life is so much better ❤️ A fellow manager at my job is telling employees they don't think I was ever actually an alcoholic. Has something like this ever happened to you?,"  I work as a Sous Chef in a typical resort restaurant. It's seasonal work so all of us live and work in the same places, word gets around fast and rumours spread quickly. 

  Another Sous Chef has been telling our colleagues that they don't believe I am a recovering alcoholic or that I ever was. At the bar of course, while they're drinking with employees. Obviously I'm very insulted, they don't know what I've been through with alcoholism or my recovery. Like, how dare you? Plus, I thought we were friends - when I opened up about my past it was because I trusted that person, so to have my trust broken like that is pretty much the biggest red flag one could fly. I didn't quit drinking so I could tell people I quit, I did it because I was going to die!!

  I've reported this to the proper channels and it's still being resolved, so I'm not necessarily looking for advice, but maybe some solidarity right? This is the first time it happened to me so maybe I wasn't prepared for how to deal with this situation. I just stayed clear of them and let upper management know how I felt.

I share about what I'm dealing with sometimes and I know it may be selfish to focus on myself, but sometimes I need to. All the answers I get are all the typical AA responses and I feel sometimes like I'm the only one that gives practical advice. Like one time I explained in detail how I dealt with the intense restlessness in early recovery, and it had nothing to do with prayer or character defects. It had to do with exercise, managing mental health in whatever way you need to (doctors, therapists, or whatever you choose) and constantly pursuing new things. Doctors can't keep you sober, but they can reduce or eliminate symptoms. Sometimes I don't want to pray my problems away. Sometimes I need someone to say, ""I've been through that, and this is how I handled it"" without making it about prayer or focusing on character defects. I'm not going to stop going because it definitely helps, but I have my holdups sometimes. Maybe I'm expecting too much of AA. I'll keep coming back though.",1753474116.0,21,50,alcoholism,addiction
1m9861j,1 year today,"It’s been a long one. I’m proud of making it. I feel like I am finally figuring out who I really am as a person. Realizing how much I hid behind all my self destructive nonsense was the biggest struggle for me this year. 

I raw dogged this (second) sobriety due to some financial circumstances and I would not recommend it. My sober journey started a year ago this morning after a suicide attempt. I woke up after drinking 3 fifths of Wild Turkey of 101 and decided to take one last stand. I had no reason to come back but somehow I did. It was literally life and death. I had just been fired, dumped, and watching with my Mom fighting the C word. But something told me to stand back up.

I made it, but should have done some things differently. My best advice is find someone to talk to. I am getting some help now and talking more about this, but I went through some tragically lonely times where I needed someone to listen. The realignment of your social life makes quitting lonely enough. Don’t do it alone. 

If you recognize you have a problem use every resource available to fix it. Our mental health is our responsibility, so there is no time like the present to make a change. 

Best of luck to all of you on the journey. Stay true and believe in yourself. Even though I am still rock bottom career and relationship wise I see a path forward and what will be ahead of me if I keep working. I hope you all find your reason to stand up and take control back.

I told him that he cannot come back unless he does a rehab program, because he has been escalating. He is autistic and has a lot of issues he needs to work out with professionals. His family (also alcoholics) said that they won't help him get into or while he is in rehab, because they don't think he needs it. They also ""don't believe in autism"". So, unless we can get him into rehab, he's going to be staying in a house full of alcoholics and alcohol and probably end up worse. Or he'll be homeless. It's been difficult to get him in, though. Some folks have said that it's much faster to get in if he goes through Crisis at the hospital, but can he just walk in and tell them he needs help? Any tips for getting into a rehab program quickly?

But then, shit went south. He got 2 epileptic seizures in 3 hours.

1m8kfaf,Tapering advice? Mental aspect,"Hi, I am new here and looking for any tapering tips regarding the mental aspect of things, not the amount as that could be considered medical advice and also greatly varies between people's consumption and biology. 

I have cut down before but ramped back up over the past year. The more I think about not drinking, the more I'm thinking about alcohol even if it is about not using it. I also get very anxious sober so cold turkey seems like a bar idea for mental and physical health in my case. 

I never blackout or act erratic, but I am losing energy and productivity due to my drinking problem, so I need to work on it before it ruins relationships or career etc.

Some things I am trying, and I hope you all can add to this to help me.

1. Stay busy. Even if I've had a drink, walking the dog, being with friends and family, etc. while tapering I may have a drink before or after, but that beats having 5 while sitting at home.

2. Mindfulness: is my heart racing or am I feeling a little shaky and need a drink as part of the taper process? Or am I just a little anxious and just want one and can go hours more without it. 

3. A tracking plan. A therapist had me start counting my drinks and if I was doing good it felt good, but if I messed up I'd be like F it. Enjoy the day and start again tomorrow. So I think utilizing a scheduled taper plan and adhering to it would help. 


Any other advice would be great. I am ready to quit but physical and mental symptoms have made it hard so I would like to work hard to taper off, and if that is not possible I will consider medical detox. 

Note: I have talked to my Dr but medications are not an option (he didn't say why but my guess is fear of a patient mixing medications and alcohol, not that I would...I was hoping that was the solution. He did look up places for help that my insurance accepts, and the only option was a place that requires 3 hours a day of group and individual therapy and provides no medication. Some of my stresses are financial so losing my job wouldn't help. If a taper doesn't work i will consider paying for a detox but currently my medical options are limited due to cost.

1m8fxrj,Help?,"Hello,

I’ll try to keep this short. I found out my mom was an alcoholic when I was 20. She had gone most of my life without drinking but when her dad died she started again. She’d always blame it on, “I took too much pain medication,” but my dad sat me down and told me what was up.

Since my 21st birthday (I’m 28 now), I’ve found myself drinking almost every day. It was initially an excitement of, “wow I’m old enough to go to bars, let’s go!” I’ve noticed now it has become more of a habit. When I do drink, I don’t get absolutely shit faced and make bad decisions. However I do find myself not wanting to drink then at some point I cave and have 4+ beers with occasional shots as well. 

I’ve never been to rehab or AA but I’ve been interested in going to a meeting just to hear the stories and tools I can use to help myself. I understand that I am the problem and not alcohol. 

Does anyone have advice they wish they knew when they first started recovery? Or any advice on how to change your habits? Thank you for your time in advance and congratulations on everyone here who has stayed sober.

1m7u6nu,2 months sober next week after 20+ years of drinking,"I grew up around alcohol, then in my teens, early 20s it was partying. I never saw anything wrong with it because it was SO NORMAL in society. Everyone started to settle down then I used it not for fun, but to cope and also for many years convinced myself it was normal due to my years of drinking and everyone doing it around me. You never think it will be you, the one that can’t stop. My head is finally becoming clear after 20+ of binge drinking and abuse. How is it so normalised in society?! Sure there are the lucky ones that come out the other side! But for many of us it’s not the case. I still struggle, still finding out who I am without it. It’s hard. But I’ll keep going and fighting the shit fight 😂. I’m not blaming anyone but myself, but society is so backward.

1m84p4y,Very Disappointed,"Well the title says it all but actually I’m very disappointed in a few things. First off I have officially let this disease ruin my career to some degree. I had recently been promoted about a year and a half ago. Which oddly is also the time my drinking really increased and went daily. To the point I was drinking during the day many times. 

Well my performance naturally suffered. Work was done and I was doing what I needed but my passion and “all in energetic” demeanor changed and I was just trying to get thru the work day. I started being paranoid and unable to function or make decisions without alcohol. I lost myself. 

Well ultimately, it hit the point my boss asked if this is what I wanted as it was apparent my passion and effort fizzled out and I was on a downward path. 

I said no…and part of me doesn’t but I also know a big culprit of that is the alcohol. It took that passion from me and made me a whole different person. I was chasing alcohol instead of chasing and continuing the great opportunity I had. 

I literally just let a close to 6 figure job go because of this…very disappointed in myself and know that it’s time to make a change. 

I took a few days off to try and cope and sober up. Felt changing the routine would help and I have 2 days sober and it has been horrible! The nightmares, the anxiety and worry is brutal. 

I’m starting to wonder if I can make it a 3rd day. Mentally I’m super anxious and worried and foggy. Physically I’m exhausted. But actually do feel better. No stomach pain and regular bowel movements in just 2 days. 

We will see what happens today but wanted to share. At this point I’m trying to save my life. I already disappointed myself and family by setting back my career in a major way. ",1753364375.0,5,6,alcoholism,addiction

1m804ig,I’m afraid I may never be able to have a beer with my dad again.,"I'm a 27M who is currently very caught up in a party/binge drinking atmosphere in my friend group and where I live. I often drink 3-4 days/nights a week (Thursday-Saturday is pretty standard) with the rest of the days prefering not to drink. On nights when I do drink, 5-6 beers is pretty standard, but on extreme nights/days it can be 8-10 or even more if we were day drinking.

I've never had what I would describe as an alcohol craving, and on the days when I'm not drinking I can easily turn down a beer, but in the last two months I had two incidents that really scared me. Both times were after three day periods where I drank probably 12-15 drinks per day for the 3 days usually on some sort of trip. After each of these periods I experienced what I believe are mild withdrawal symptoms. Tremors, sweats, insomnia, racing heart, and crazy anxiety for about three days after. The first time this happened I took about two weeks off of drinking and then tried to ""ease"" my way back into it and I was able to keep things under control and had no bad symptoms, but I got a little reckless this last weekend and after another three day period of heavy drinking (I'm hesitant to call them benders because I know that can mean different things to different people) I had the same sympotms as before. Albeit this time the symptoms were a bit more mild because I think I drank less overall this occasion than the first.

I've read alot on here about kindling effects and whether or not binge drinking can lead to withdrawals. It seems everyone has their own experience and alcohol effects everyone differently. I just want to make sure I'm not on a path to something worse or more serious, and if it's possible to ""moderately"" drink safely even after experiencing these symptoms.

1m7mddk,2 years sober: What keeps me going and what doesn't,"It's been a little over 2 years since I was intoxicated. I want to share the unvarnished version of why I intend to keep going, probably for the rest of my life. 

*What keeps me going:*

-Not setting money on fire at bars. I still go occasionally and have mocktails or soda, but it's rare I spend more than $30 on a night out.

-Not waking up hungover. You have no idea (ok, you might) how much I came to hate hangovers.

-Not having something I have to hide constantly from people around me.

-Not needing to drink to go to sleep.

-Knowing that none of my challenges in life will get any easier if I drink.

-The fear that drinking could legitimately cause me to lose it all. Real talk, folks.

-Being able to drop some pounds, finally (started a GLP-1 recently)

*What doesn't keep me going:*

-My blood pressure being down

-A sense of superiority when I see other people drink (you will stop judging, give yourself time)

-Being more in touch with my emotional state (plenty of other ways to avoid that!)

-Performing better at work / advancing my career (it's still work, life is still a struggle)

-The approval of anyone else

-My skin / face (goodbye puffy glow, hello aging and wrinkles!)

-Milestone markers (they stopped motivating me after year one)

I would make the same decision to quit every time. No question. The thing I always remind myself of in moments of temptation (very rare for me, at this point) is that my life will never improve by choosing to drink. The thought of being drunk makes me feel sick. Like I'm standing over the edge of an endless void that will suck all meaning and structure out of my life and smear me like a squashed bug on the pavement. That may not be a happy image, but that's real.

Not drinking will not fix your life. But it will give you the freedom to choose to fix it. Drinking takes that choice away. 

Don't give up the choice to live.",1753307440.0,19,2,alcoholism,addiction

1m7wylk,Brain fog since hangover,"Hello, I'm 20 years old and i started drinking about a year ago but not consistently until recently when I started going on actual benders, during hangovers I would experience short term memory loss, but ever since one hangover it felt like it never went away, well once I really started to notice it I got really nervous and just quit, im about a week sober and the effects aren't nearly as severe as the effects of the day of hangovers, but I just get really nervous about stuff like this, I also quit weed more than a year ago though I've had it a few times this year (July 2025) but probably 6 times maximum. Anyways for example tonight I was scrolling through Instagram and I read a post, scrolled to the next 3 seconds later and just completely forgot what the post above was even about.

I would kinda drink heavy but I didn't have many blackouts and never hit my head while drunk.

Drinking sun up to sun down, can’t remember YEARS of memories because I was always so drunk, thought u was awesome at work because I could drink and still get promoted… it was bad, but with years of help, therapy and medication, I got sober!

Now to my friends husband. She felt she could open up to me because of my history and she told me about her husband’s drinking problem. I gave her all of my advice and she even got him to try my most important advice which was taking Antabuse. I started it and it’s literally what kept me on track and made it to where I could get sober after all else failed. He tried it and ended up in the hospital, drank through it and she said his eyes were turning yellow from it. He seriously can’t stop. He’s gotten to the point of alcohol delirium to where he thought he saw demons in broad daylight and was trying to fight them off. 

He said he saw a demon in my friend too and started to come at her. She says he’s an amazing guy… except when he drinks. I get that cuz I used to be there. But I finally saw I needed help and I did and spent soooo much time working on myself and what to do to get better. But he can’t right now. 

And I get that… you have to be ready. You have to see the problem, accept it and want to fix it so bad you’re ready to put yourself into a mental and physical spiral just to “get better.” It’s fucking hard. He’s not there. 

Idk what my friend should do because she’s going through this (and he’s mean and violent when drunk) and her son trying to run away, a mom with a terminal illness AND family members who only want the worst for her to benefit herself. I’m going to be blunt. If you were her, would you divorce him? She’s tried sooooo much to help him. Setting up therapy, psych appts, getting him checked in, taking to the hospital, tracking his every movement because she knows he’s always drunk and might end up in a ditch… I understand both sides. But as an ex alcoholic myself, I’d say to talk divorce because she has tried so hard to help him and he isn’t ready to help himself.

Some people are highly sensitive to it's effect on dopamine production in the nucleus accumbens.

It makes sense then that some people are heavily drawn to it, especially considering that a considerable minority of people respond very intensely to it.

I've been an alcoholic/addict for the past 15 years ""I'm 27"". Recently I've been trying to get sober and, it's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I've pretty much lost all my friends over the years so, I don't have any friends. I feel so completely and utterly alone! I'm severely depressed and, my anxiety is so bad that, I can barely even leave my house to go to the store🤦 I've been trying to build my courage up to go to a skatepark for the first time in years cause I used to love to skate and, I desperately need a hobby but, I'm just "" Pathetically enough"" absolutely terrified for some reason.

1m6iex8,My journey.,"Hi, I am a 40 year old chubbyish guy, who moved to Germany from Turkey. The alcohol prices in Germany is so cheap I had developed a habit, just because I can find 1 euro 1lt wine. 

This went on for 2 years. I was never a heavy drinker. 350ml of vodka at my worst. Every threeish days, mostly never back to back. 

Last 3 months I realized I am exceeding this amount, decided to drop it. I had a racing heart for a day. And a headache for 3-4 days. If this much alcohol causes these withdrawal symptoms in a 106 kg Male, heavier drinkers what you are experiencing is quite normal. Please wean off easily and get help from professionals. Alcohol is basically a poison. I thought I had bad bowels but it was booze after all. 

Keep at it, be strong. There are no dialysis for liver disease, you are worthy, you are valuable for your loved ones. 

It's been 2 weeks for me. When I crave, Cola Zero is my go to drink. Alcohol and calorie free. Also I used to mix it with vodka so taste is same almost :P

1m6ki4v,Grew up around addiction — wondering if tech could help people stay on track in hard moments,"I grew up in a home where alcohol was always in the background. My dad struggled with it for years, and it left a mark — on how I grew up, how I handle stress, how I see control.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about those moments *right before* a relapse — when the urge creeps in, quietly but powerfully. And I keep wondering: could technology help in that window?

If someone’s open to it, your phone already knows a lot. What if it could use that to offer support — not in a judgmental way, just a timely nudge?

* You’re near a bar or liquor store you used to go to → it gently checks in
* Your calendar’s packed → it prompts a breathing break or reminder of your goal
* You just had a tough text exchange → it encourages you not to let the moment win

I’m curious to hear from people trying to quit alcohol, smoking, or anything else:

– Do you use anything like this today?

– Could something like this actually help?

– What would *not* help?

1m6gfp0,Is this the end of the road for my drinking?,"
I’m a 29 year old man from the UK.

I started drinking regularly at 18 like most people in the UK. 

To begin with I was purely a weekend drinker. Drinking on a Friday or Saturday. Then it progressed to drinking Friday and Saturday with the odd Sunday thrown in.

Once Covid came, although I was drinking less as I wasn’t going out on my usual Weekend benders, I started to drink during the weekdays. 

This trend followed me after Covid was finished and the last 2 years I have been drinking most days of the week. I would drink around 3-5 pints of beer most days and then would have a big drink on a Friday and Saturday, drinking till blackout most of the time. I might have one or two days off drinking a week, but this is usually after my weekend bender when I am too ill from the effects of alcohol to continue, and spend these days in recovery mode.

A lot of my drinking is still social as I will go out to pubs and bars at the weekend with friends and sometimes during the weekdays. But sometimes I am going to the pub on my own during the weekdays to drink and in the hope to meet other people.  I do occasionally drink at home on my own when feeling low or depressed.

My biggest problem is once I have drank a certain amount, I have no off button, I keep drinking till it’s home time or I’m black out.

Drinking has brought about many good times for me and is a key component in my social life and how I socialise, but I feel it’s taking a grip on me and I’m not in control anymore. It’s has also caused me to do many things I regret doing and caused harm to myself.

I have injured myself many times whilst drinking and I’m lucky to be alive to be honest, after one time fracturing my skull, as well as numerous other smaller injuries on separate occasions. I have also engaged in drug taking and sexually promiscuous behaviour.

I’m currently not working since my skull injury which was just over a year ago. I have no complications now from the injury and can go back to work if I choose to. 

However in the lead up to my injury I wasn’t enjoying the job I was doing and was very depressed. But I am also thinking my lack of purpose from not working might be enabling my drinking to the extent it’s at.

My parents have expressed concern numerous times for my drinking.

I am writing this after another weekend bender, I drank Thursday through to Sunday last week, blacking out Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 

I spent all day yesterday sick in bed and I’m sick in bed again today.

I had been told 3/4 years ago I had signs of fatty liver, whenever I’ve had a big drinking session now I feel so ill for days and I’m constantly vomiting and can’t eat, and getting dull pains where my liver is. 

How do I know if I am having withdrawals? as after any big drinking session I have now, I am sick for days, can’t sleep, having panic attacks, vomiting etc

I feel at the end of my tether with it all and don’t know where to turn. 

Do I need to stop drinking all together? 
Is moderation an option?
I’ve tried periods of sobriety before for 90 days, is another period of sobriety to get me back to some normality a good idea?

Sorry for the long post. I’m just looking for help and I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this

1m6q2fc,Should I go back to rehab?,"
Hello everyone, so, I’ve been in rehab three times and I was last in from October-January. I’ve been in a pretty big funk recently and and feel like I’m right back to where I was, a THIRD time. It was weird, it felt like everything is gonna be okay in the beginning of the year. I found a new friend group and even got a gf after three years or so of isolation, but then lost it all after I got back on pain pills. I’ve been clean off of those for a little but I’ve been smoking weed every night, drinking here and there, and haven’t been able to go to bed on time at all. I went from being so completely happy to  absolutely miserable and alone again, and I’m stuck on the fence on whether I should go back. ",1753218128.0,0,5,alcoholism,addiction
1m6jdkw,Feeling a little defeated,"Hi. Sorry this is my first post, it might be kind of long but I feel like I have to talk/vent to someone or make some changes. Alcoholism runs in my family. I grew up with a high functioning alcoholic (my mom) and swore to myself that I would not end up like her. She would work and then pass out, rinse and repeat my whole life.

 My dad was way more involved with me, basically being my sole parent since my mom had been passed out most of the free time I would've had to see her. (They also broke up shortly after I was born but were essentially roomates my whole life despite hating each other, so that led to a weird family dynamic.)

 I started drinking around the time I turned 16, occasionally stealing booze in the house. It only seemed to get really bad when I started buying hard liquor. I moved out with my boyfriend and we started drinking quite heavily and always had whiskey/vodka in the house. 

I had just turned 20, and everything got really worse after my dad died. It happened very quickly in the span of a week right before the holidays. I am an only child and was really struggling to cope with the grief I was feeling, while simultaneously ""babysitting"" my mom. She wasn't at all supportive when everything happened, and I had to make most of the arrangements with my parents landlord, figure out bills, and literally move her into a different apartment because she didn't want to figure it out herself. I guessIy I used alcohol to cope during this time. I felt like I was in survival mode with my stressful job and my personal life. I didn't really take proper time to grieve, and was self medicating. 

After I turned 21, I realized I could buy my own alcohol. Only in the past year I've been buying little handles of hard liquor and stashing them in my dresser. My boyfriend has found a few but brushed it off, I feel incredibly guilty for hiding anything from him or lying to him in general. 

Recently I changed jobs, I was making really good money as a waitress on a busy street but my job was very stressful and demanding, I was at my wits end and decided to quit hoping that it would help me drink less. Now I'm making less then half of what I used to and get stressed about money. Despite this I still buy alcohol I don't have the money for. I feel depressed thinking about how much money I could've saved/put towards something fun/meaningful trip or clothes or something I actually enjoy. 

Recently I had a scary episode where my heart rate reached 187, I drove to the hospital with my boyfriend because I was worried I was going to have a heart attack or something. They determined that it was likely related to drinking, and gave me some lorazepame. I think it could've partially been anxiety, but more likely related to heavily drinking. 

I thought about maybe trying weed again, but I feel like I can never find a sweet spot and always end up way too sleepy or if it's sativa getting really anxious. I also feel like I need some sort of anxiety/depression medication because I feel that is largely why I turn to drinking in the first place. (I also think that I have undiagnosed adhd which may contribute to the problem as well) I get insured at my new job in six months so I think I have to wait a bit. I'm starting school againt in the fall, I failed two classes last semester (the first time in my life) partially because of my drinking. 

I guess I don't really have anything else to say. I just feel like I've been in survival mode ever since I became an adult, and to an extent a lot of my childhood. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I have control to change this but I guess I don't?  just wanted to get some of these feelings off my chest. I'm hoping this post might hold me accountable, so that maybe I can start changing some things. ",1753203146.0,2,2,alcoholism,addiction

1m6ng1w,Former coworker came to me begging for help with alcoholism. What can I do to help him? [ADVICE NEEDED],"Hey guys, a couple of weeks ago I (32F) had a former coworker, ""Kyle,"" (31M) hit me up for an...arrangement, of sorts. No strings attached, hanging out, and of course, sex. I'm fine with all of that, I'm married (husband 39M, but not relevant to this situation. Trust me, hubby and I are doing GREAT and are ENM/Polyam/open, together 10 years and happily open for 7 of those), and that won't be changing.

Anyway, Kyle and I got past that whole former coworkers thing pretty quickly over the weekend, and started to get comfortable. Last night, while he couldn't sleep, he told me he's been drinking ""swimming pools of vodka"" for the past several years. He's seeing the ways its affecting his body and his mind, and he's sick of what hes doing to himself. He's shoved so many feelings and problems down, due to a combination of alcoholism and having Borderline Personality Disorder. I believe part of why he's coming to me is I also have BPD, and have had it well managed for years now.

How do I help him? He's 4 hours from me, but will likely be moving back here in a month or 3, depending on when his job sends him home. I'm not going to force anything on him. I know that won't work. He's basically begging for any help he can get. What can I do? I don't want to hurt him. I want to help him. My dad is a former alcoholic so I know it can be hard.

1m5y8mo,My dad picked me up from the Airport drunk,"After 3 good years sober, my dad came to pick me up drunk. 
He used to be an alcoholic up until I was 14 after a panic attack where he was hospitalized. Came back a completely different person and I was so happy. 
Now, three years later, after the death of his sister (who died of alcohol induced rapidly progressing Alzheimer's) he picked up the bottle, and I'd only realized after he missed 4 turns, took us on a full 30 minute circle back to the airport, sped like he was trying to meet God himself, and could barely form a coherent sentence. I'm honestly ashamed it took me so long to figure out. It's the worst I've seen as far as I can remember (which my memory might be skewed because I was used to seeing him drunk growing up). As soon as I realized I started panicking, begging him to pull over, even threatening to call the cops. I truly believe it's only by Gods will he managed to get to the port in the first place. 

So for anyone who needs motivation to stop, please remember that it's your families lives in the line as well. Even when you think you're in control or it's not that much, it is. ",1753139802.0,39,7,alcoholism,addiction

1m6lkoh,Help...?,"So, back story; in HS i fell in heavy/binge drinking w/ my now ex husband and father of two of my 3 kids from about 14/15yrs old til i was 17 pregant w/ my first in 2009. from 2015/16 to late 2017 I was in a very abusive relationship and drank nightly w/ my now ex along w/ abusing other things. Until about 3yrs ago I didn't drink much other than social events generally at family events. 1 night there i blacked out and i was SA by my step dad's friend and I again stayed away from drinking more than 1 drink at a birthday dinner or something at a restaurant. But a little over 3yrs ago I began a relationship w/ a 3rd alcoholic who drinks anywhere from 3-4 small glasses of scotch before work and I dont have a count on how much he consumes from the time he gets off work to when he gets up the next day. I, again, started drinking. Its destroying me mentally and im sure physically. Along w/ the issues w/ life, career, kids, and our relationship. There's more nights than I like to admit that I dont remember anything. The worst recently when he came home from work w/ a black eye and I have zero recollection what happened but I know I was the cause. Originally, I started w/ a little wine. That turned to the whole bottle. Then out of convenience and similar taste preferences, I began sharing his scotch w/ him instead of the wine. That was fine, til it wasnt. I blacked out quicker or became emotion or violent ect. Then I switched to margaritas (summer time) and had a day at the lake that I completely passed out on the sand and apparently had to be carried to the car still asleep and dont even remember being there at all. (Which seems weird since I didnt drink prior to going) then I switched to beer and that was fine except instead of building any kind of tolerance it seems less is causing the black outs and out of character behavior. 
Its so difficult to stop even though every bit of me wants to stop...coincidentally every day I say I HAVE to stop he shows up from work w/ his scotch and something for me. Once its in the house its extremely difficult to not drink it  plus as ass backwards as it is, I feel it to be rude to not drink what he brings for me. Even though I know he will eventually drink it himself if its there long enough. 
Ive also tried not drinking at all but around mid week or so (to a degree the first day as well) I cave just so I can get solid sleep. I struggle to fall asleep. Have horrific nightmares. Wake up constantly. And still somehow function raising kids working a demanding job ect. Then the cycle repeats: only 2 drinks then it turns to 3 or 4 then by the weekend its anywhere from 3-12/night. Just to by monday be right back where I was the week before....

Point is I was still very ""myself"" and felt in control, so I continued drinking not knowing how far I already was. Tolerance, I guess. I probably got well into 0.30% territory before I went to sleep, which is what I don't remember.

I typically drink these drinks called beatboxes that have 11% and I would do two for the past year and then this year I started to drink in the morning and by the afternoon my buzzed would go away so I would get more alchol and drink like 4-5 beatboxes a day. I started to drink like crazy where I lost track of how much I would drink. I don’t even know why I do it anymore I just like the feeling how I feel so happy and outgoing. I lost my boyfriend and friends because of alchol and at first I would use it for my anxiety because I like how it makes me more social but then there was times where I would act out and people would get annoyed because I was drunk and things I would say and not remember. I noticed I gained weight and I look bloated. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I told myself so many times I was going to stay sober but ended up buying more liquor. I had right pain underneath my breast and I was worried it was my liver and finally went to get blood work done.

This year started off rough for me and this began my daily drinking. I don’t think I drank every single day before this year. I still drank heavily but more binge drinking a few days out of the week and then sober for a few days. But (almost) every day (give or take a generous amount of days when I’m hungover or just days where I decide not to) I’ve been drinking tequila.

I try to get the smaller bottles to “control” myself but I’ll just end up drinking something else.

I’m scared. I’m worried that I may have reached physical addiction - is there a way to tell? Should I go cold turkey? Should I go to rehab? I don’t want to give up alcohol forever, I just want to gain control and not feel like an endless pit that I need to drink every drop to feel something….

I left for work pretty rested and had a good meal. I was feeling like I was going to have a great shift actually. 

About an hour in I started feeling really bad. Basically like an anxiety attack but with blurred vision and a terrible headache. I left work like 3 hours in. 

I had to stop by the gas station and grab a drink. 
I’m one unit in. Feeling better, probably going to have 1-2 more. 

Im not going to the hospital. Without getting into a long story I’m not going to the hospital…


I haven’t been drinking hard liquor in weeks. Just those stupid beatbox wine coolers. I’d drink 2-3 a night. What I foolishly didn’t realize is 3 of those beatbox’s = 2 bottles of wine. I underestimated the units I’ve been taking in because I wasn’t drinking the hard stuff.  

So. I’m trying to currently relax and calm my nerves. 

I’ve tapered successfully before. I just got ahead of myself and thought I could handle it. 

Every veteran alcoholic knows day 3 is the worst. I probably should have had a drink last night. This is the ugly truth.

1m5m1jk,Am I (20F) an alcoholic? What next steps should I do?,"DISCLAIMER: I’m sure this question gets asked a lot, but I really need some help figuring out what to do about my developing alcohol dependence. 

So I know that I have an addictive personality. I became addicted to self harm when I was 15yrs old, and I’ve been self harming ever since (currently 120 days clean of cutting, but I still scratch frequently). I developed an eating disorder when I was 13yrs old, and I’m still struggling with it. I started vaping at 18yrs old and I’m still vaping. I started taking edibles this year and I can’t seem to limit myself much. I had my first drink when I was freshly 19yrs old, but I started drinking when my mental health was at a really low low, so I think I pretty much immediately developed a negative relationship with alcohol. Within the past few years I’ve had several times where I’ve lost complete control with alcohol. I mean that I’ll go into the evening thinking “I don’t want to get drunk tonight, I’ll limit my drinks, I’ll prove to myself and others that I’m strong,” and yet I still get blackout drunk. I’ve hurt many people. My mom straight up called me an alcoholic last spring. My college friends (who were supplying alcohol bc I’m not 21 yet) cut me off last semester. 

I’m working on forming a healthy relationship with alcohol, but when my mental health is bad (I have bipolar, GAD, etc), it’s really fucking hard. My goal is to get to a point where I can still drink, but I won’t lose control. I don’t want to miss out on the feeling of being drunk, and I won’t lie that I need it to avoid my other addictions from getting worse. If I can’t drink, I’ll just do disordered eating behaviors or I’ll self harm or I’ll green out. Or, what I’m most afraid of, I’ll kill myself. I don’t want to be dependent on it, but I want to use it as a tool in my toolbox yk?

Overall, my questions are 1) do you think I’m an alcoholic? And 2) do you think there’s any hope for me being able to form a healthy relationship with alcohol?",1753111892.0,3,9,alcoholism,addiction

She went to rehab two years ago but has gradually said “she’s learned how to handle herself” and now drinks daily. She is so smart and comes from a decently affluent background and has a good job but I can tell her demeanor is changing. She posts videos of herself on social media where is she is falling down drunk, slurring her words, or just passed out. She seems to think it’s all a big joke? Or she doesn’t care? 

She is my ride or die. I don’t even remember ever really existing without her and I don’t know what to do. I can tell she’s just falling deeper into this.

Posting as a daughter of an alcoholic
He was sober for almost 10 years,  I was 15 when he got sober and remember it clearly. He was super involved in AA meetings this entire time, has a great sponsor. Unfortunately he has relapsed - he is older (in his 60’s) and just got fired from his job. He works in manual labor and just can’t handle that workload anymore. He has told me the past few weeks he is so depressed. (We live states away, so just speaking via phone) 

I called him today, like i do everyday -  and he sounded horrible, he said he felt sick, but no - he was slurring his words and sounded drunk. 
I texted my step mom, and she confirmed he had been drinking (and recently? had a drink on a hawaii vacation with her that apparently started this?) i was shocked to hear this. and sad that no one told me. He was a single dad, and i’m an only child so we are very close. 

I’m just so hurt, i want him to get sober again, for his family and for his health. I’m so sad. 

I called him back and didn’t mention what she said, but let him know he could tell me anything and that i’m there for him. He didn’t say much. 

How can i support him from afar? Would it be wise to try and speak to him about this when he’s sober (hopefully?) tomorrow? I don’t want to make this any worse and make him feel bad.

I come from a family where the culture of drinking to excess is very normalized. I don’t visit them often because of this, and for other reasons that boil down to dysfunctional family dynamics. 

After this visit, it really hit me how much of a problem it is, mostly with the older generations. My parent was the family scapegoat, got into trouble young, was in and out of institutions, and finally went to AA and got sober. No one else in the family views themselves as having a problem, but it’s painfully obvious to myself and some of my cousins. I’m talking all day drinking, all night drinking, hair of the dog, rinse and repeat.

I would really like to learn more about family dysfunction with alcohol/addiction, but everything I have been reading seems to be about one family member and the rest of the family’s response to them.

I was quite a heavy alcoholic, I always drunk more than I should but not to a crazy level. Then two-three years ago, my mum passed away and my partner cheated on me before our wedding - so I drank, lots, maybe 10x beers a night, sometimes more.

1m5c77s,a rant and how can i help?,"last night, my mom and i had to call the police on my father after a family party because he had way too much to drink at a reception and he started speaking very angrily to me and my mother, mostly her. im very shaken up, and i thought this could maybe be a good place to rant about it and figure out what i can do to help. for a back story, my dad’s been through a lot recently with his mother being incredibly sick and his dad (his parents were divorced) taking his own life about 2 months ago, and my dad lost a brother to suicide when i was a baby (20 something years ago). obviously that’s a lot to carry. i don’t dismiss that. my mom and i have always thought he maybe has undiagnosed bipolar and/or depression, because it seems to run on his side of the family (to a point, cuz i don’t know how genetic that actually is?). my dad has a few drinks a day, usually a couple beers. ive never really seen him drunk. ive seen him tipsy, and ive heard him make a mean comment or two, but then he quickly realizes what he did and apologizes and goes to bed to avoid conflict. but last night was different. he wouldn’t stop no matter what we did or said. now, i don’t think my dad would ever physically hurt anyone or himself, but verbally, absolutely and that was made very clear last night. we were at a hotel and he wouldn’t stop mouthing off, even though he could barely sit up straight he just wouldn’t shut up and go to bed, so i requested another room with my mom because i didn’t want either of us to deal with it and i was scared. not necessarily for our safety, but i was scared for him. im always scared when people drink, because im scared of alcohol poisoning and people dying (losing family is a huge anxiety to me always). when we got downstairs, she claimed she was worried he was suicidal and the hotel staff called the police to show up non emergency just to talk to us and to try to talk to him and see what’s going on- after talking to police, she didn’t really actually think that fully, but she knew he was really mentally messed up and needed to talk to someone. by the time the cops got to the room, he was already asleep lol. they talked to him for about an hour. i wasn’t present, but they didn’t think he was a threat to himself or others, so they didn’t take him in anywhere for like detox or observation or whatever it’s called and they gave him their numbers as well as numbers to resources. my mom ended up staying with him to keep an eye on him, but i was still too shaken up and sick from anxiety that i stayed in the new room by myself. she claims it was a wake up call for him. she said he admitted to the police that he needs therapy and needs help to stop drinking so much. today’s been weird. we’re all trying to get along, and we are, but there’s obviously a lingering tension because he knows what he did. he knows how bad he upset me and my mom and how scared i was seeing him like that. he’s apologized a lot today and has said a lot that he knows he hurt/scared me/us, that he doesn’t fully remember last night besides getting in the uber back to the hotel and then the police showing up, and that he needs to get help, he just doesn’t know where to start but is willing to do so, especially if me and mom will support him. 

i guess with that all being said, how can i best support him? and my mom? and myself? im so worried my parents will be divorced from this or we’ll be a broken family. i dont think hes mad we got law enforcement involved, i think it kind of made him realize oh, this IS a problem we need to fix, but im scared someday he’ll be angry at us again, like what if he drinks again and then holds that over us? what if it makes him even more depressed because he’s ashamed of how he acted? my family and my parents are some of the most important things to me, and fearing losing any of that has me terrified. ive always been anxious when my parents bicker (they bicker more often than not), but again, nothings ever really escalated terribly. ive always been used to them having a bit of tension over silly little things, but nothings ever been harmful. but now after last night, im scared anytime they argue it’ll turn into that. i am having a really hard time not thinking of all of the worst scenarios that could come out of any argument, any drinking, etc. now. i can’t shake it from my head. he sounded so evil. he didn’t even sound like himself. i can’t stop thinking of all of the really vulgar, mean things he said and replaying them (and last night as a whole) in my brain. it feels like a bad dream. how can i make sure he gets the help and he’s okay? that my mom gets any help she may need to mentally process this too? and myself? it feels silly to say it felt really traumatic, but it really did and im just scared of my family dynamic being ruined now.

1m50sot,Do you think it’s possible to have a healthy relationship with alcohol after addiction?,"Hey everyone, I’m currently doing harm reduction with the end goal of moving towards sobriety or ideally having a healthy relationship with alcohol (social or special occasion type thing). The last 8ish months I relapsed and went from the HR I was doing, back to drinking every night. Recently I had  been drinking around 3-7 cans of cider or a bottle of wine every night but the last 2 weeks I ended up having to go cold turkey (bad, I know) because I literally can afford it. I’m hoping I can use this opportunity to segway into sobriety with the help of my meds and therapy. I’m in my mid twenties and play rugby, which has a very big drinking culture. I know my team will support me, but there can be a lot of pressure from other teams at social tournaments, and I also just want to enjoy alcohol like a normal person, not in the way I have been using it.

Another part of me really wants to tell him that it's none of his business and if the way I act pisses him off so much, what even keeps him here? He could just go. The door's wide open. I hate this duality. I don't really want him to go. My brain is split in two and I can't make the two halves fit.

I'd have usually have gotten wasted at least two or three times by now, but no, I've had a sober few days off. The insomnia is still kicking my ass though, I'm not really sleeping and I'm waking up early - but I'm hoping one day soon I can return to the state I was in before i started binging several times a week.

But that's what angers me. HOW did I ever let it get so bad I was pissing myself, binging back-to-back, waking up with large patches of blood SOMEWHERE, and why? I keep wondering even though I know the answer, if that makes any sense? Though, especially after the past couple of weeks, I see my alcohol consumption and what it does to me for what it is - it's a destructive escape and I don't know why I thought I was outside of the damaging effects of it for so long, especially at the start. Because of this, I want to stay sober for as long as I possibly can. I can already feel a slight weight off of my shoulders I didn't know was there. I'm so angry at myself for it and for what I've done to myself and others.

But then, I will always miss how much better the alcohol MADE me feel better at first, especially in January. If not that, it helped me think, get to the bottom of my feelings, memories and thoughts - it helped me reconnect with myself. I don't think I will really have my own peace and headspace like that again without it, or the numb rush to my legs with that first bottle, or the sunny evenings I did enjoy being drunk and wet-brained. At the same time, I know I'm missing what I could never even have towards the end of it - I stopped feeling any of that entirely. When I started drinking just to get as pissed as possible no matter how much it made me feel like shit. I don't know.. It's hard to reconcile how much I hated drinking, and the fact that at first, it was amazing. I think it genuinely helped me get through the start of the year without killing myself. And I miss that. The irony is, I started drinking JUST to harm myself and I could never get into that peaceful limbo state - it was all or nothing, nevermind the sickness and brain fog.

The brain fog hasn't fully gone away, again I hope it's not long until i'm sharp again. Slightly unrelated, I know it sounds so childish, but I'm going to a theme park in two weeks, and I'm looking forward to it. I don't remember the last time I was even slightly excited for something - It's the first theme park I will have been to since I was young enough to get in for free back in 2009, haha. Again, maybe Alton Towers is a childish thing to be excited for but hey. I'm having a sober two weeks and I'm going to damn-well make sure it's many more - if that day's not a thing to stay sober for so I can appreciate, I don't know what is. And my cravings aren't massive - I have had one moment at work today where I was pretty stressed and thought ""I could use a drink"" but that's not really enough to convince me. I could really peel my eyes away from the alcohol when I did my shopping after, but I soon just ignored it and got out as fast as possible.. So hopefully, soon, it should be easier to ignore. As annoyed and bewildered as I am with myself, I'm hoping I will look back on this past year of constant alcohol misuse as a stupid, late-teenage mistake.

This topic is incredibly close to my heart. It’s one of the reasons I became a health coach and personal trainer—I value health deeply. Because without it, we don’t have anything.

Sadly, most doctors—98% in my opinion—don’t truly understand the physical and emotional dependence these drugs can create. (I don’t use the word “addiction,” because it's not quite that. But dependence? Absolutely.)

This blog will be long and detailed because I want to give you as much insight and support as I can. I’ll also offer the perspective I’ve gained in hindsight—because, as they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

I’m going to break it down into three parts:

2. How I did it
3. What it’s like now

My journey with psychiatric medications began in my late teens after my first panic attack—triggered by smoking weed. I’ve always said weed opened Pandora’s box. Every suppressed emotion I had ever buried came rushing to the surface while I was high.

Trying to manage a panic attack while sober is hard. Managing one while high? Nearly impossible.

That experience led to my first prescription: Xanax, as needed, to manage panic attacks. Thankfully, my psychiatrist was cautious and soon transitioned me to an SSRI—starting with Zoloft (if I remember correctly), eventually switching to Lexapro.

By 18, I was sober from drugs and alcohol but had jumped fully into the world of prescription meds. It started with 10 mg of Lexapro and occasional Xanax.

Lexapro brought its own issues: low libido, emotional numbness, and ED.

The solution? My psychiatrist added Wellbutrin XL (300 mg). This is a common pharmacological strategy—pairing an SSRI with a DNRI.

Soon I had too much energy and lost my appetite.

So what came next? Remeron, 45 mg.

I was now on Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Remeron. A “polypharmacy” cocktail affecting nearly every neurotransmitter:

* Lexapro → Serotonin
* Wellbutrin → Dopamine
* Remeron → Norepinephrine and Serotonin

The side effects?

* ED
* Anxiety
* Intense carb cravings (Remeron-munchies, 10x worse than weed)
* Sleeping 12–14 hours a day
* Inconsistent libido

Despite living a healthy lifestyle—sober, teaching SoulCycle 6–8 classes a week, living in NYC—I still struggled. That’s when I realized something had to change.

# Making the Decision to Taper Off

In my early 20s, I moved back to Newport Beach. I was still taking all three medications but felt like they weren’t helping—and might be doing more harm than good.

So I made a decision: I was going to come off them.

While my doctor knew about it, I took responsibility for my own taper. I did extensive research, primarily on forums like [SurvivingAntidepressants.org](http://SurvivingAntidepressants.org) and by reading The Antidepressant Solution.

Here’s what I learned—and what I now recommend as a health coach helping people taper with Drs approval.

# HOW I DID IT

# Phase 1: Set the Foundation

Before you begin a taper, make sure you’ve got these dialed in:

**1. A Stable Environment**  
You don’t want to begin tapering in the middle of a chaotic season. I made the mistake of tapering during the pandemic—not ideal. Aim for a stable life rhythm with support from family, friends, or community.

**2. Nutrition**  
This is huge. A poorly nourished body will struggle more with withdrawal symptoms. Focus on:

* High-protein intake: Proteins provide amino acids, which are the precursors to neurotransmitters.
   * Tryptophan → Serotonin (found in chicken, turkey)
   * Tyrosine → Dopamine (found in red meat)
* Cut processed sugar and junk food
* Eat whole, organic, local foods
* Hydrate with mineral-rich water (0.5 oz per pound of body weight)

**3. Sleep Hygiene**  
Sleep is when the brain detoxifies via the glymphatic system. Prioritize:

* 7–8 hours a night
* Consistent bedtime (10 PM) and wake time (6 AM)
* Cool, dark room (65–69°F)
* Avoid screens and blue light after sunset
* Stop eating 3 hours before bed
* Use air purifiers and eliminate EMFs when possible

**4. Movement**  
Establish a consistent, non-stressful movement routine—like walks, yoga, or light strength training.

# Phase 2: The Taper

**Rule #1: One drug at a time**  
Start with the one you’ve been on the least or the lowest dose. For me, that was Wellbutrin.

**Rule #2: Go slow—10% cuts max**  
Never cut more than 10% of your current dose at a time. Wait at least 2 weeks between cuts. The goal is to *minimize CNS stress*, not rush the process.

**Rule #3: Use liquid formulas or compounding pharmacies**  
This was a game changer.

* Lexapro has a liquid version
* Remeron required a compounding pharmacy
* Wellbutrin was trickier due to different release types (start with XL, then SR, then IR)

**Rule #4: Keep a log**  
Track every dose adjustment and how you feel. This gives you data—and encouragement during hard times.

**Rule #5: Pause when needed**  
If you have a big event or are feeling overwhelmed, pause your taper. Stability is more important than speed.

**Rule #6: Regulate your nervous system**  
This is something I wish I had done sooner. Try:

* Meditation
* Somatic experiencing
* Trauma Release Exercises (TRE)
* Breathwork
* Brain retraining programs (I liked Gupta and Primal Trust)

These tools help rebuild safety in your body—especially as suppressed emotions rise.

**Rule #7: Stop obsessing**  
Don’t fall into the trap of doomscrolling Reddit threads or scary forums. Avoid the nocebo effect. Distract yourself with joy, fun, and connection.

# What It’s Like Now

It’s been four years since I’ve been medication-free.

Has it been perfect? No. I got caught up in fears about PSSD and other “what ifs.” But once I stopped researching worst-case scenarios and started living again—those symptoms began to fade.

I started keeping a gratitude journal of good days. That helped reinforce: I am healing.

Healing doesn’t happen in a fight-flight-freeze state. It happens in a parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) state.

# Final Thoughts

This journey changed my life—and I hope my story helps yours.

💡 A few final reminders:

* Always consult your doctor. This isn’t medical advice.
* Most doctors don’t recognize protracted withdrawal and might misdiagnose symptoms as “relapse.”
* Purpose matters. So does faith.

Finding Christ three years ago changed everything for me. Prayer, scripture, and community brought a peace I never got from a pill.

Do some people need medication? Yes.  
Is it being overprescribed? Absolutely.

Many of us don’t need to be medicated—we need to be supported, seen, and taught how to feel safe again in our own bodies.

If you’re in this process, I’m rooting for you. You’re not broken. You’re healing. And you’re not alone.

With much love and hope,

But tonight he got home reeking of tequila. It’s usually whiskey, but apparently he got a few oz poured into his water bottle from a mutual friend of ours after a retirement party that he didn’t even attend. I think it’s very likely he ASKED for a little extra. Never mind that I hate it when he bikes home drunk because no matter how many times he tells me he’s been in worse conditions and can handle it, and “at least I’m not driving…” I’ve seen that bike wobble on two drinks. And when he got home tonight I was on the couch with another mutual friend and I saw her cringe at the smell. A year ago he threw up IN HER CAR after drinking too much on a fucking Sunday night. He then poured ANOTHER cup of tequila when he was clearly already inebrieted. We are supposed to be looking at wedding venues tomorrow. 

I love this man but I’m so scared. I do not want to marry an alcoholic that is not actively pursuing sobriety. I don’t know how to help him and I don’t know that he recognizes he needs help even after I’ve tried to explain to him that he cannot hold his liquor, 2 tall boys every week night and a full liquor bottle every weekend was not a “normal” I ever wanted for myself.

1m2ntqg,I think I’m an alcoholic (25F),"Hi everyone!

This is something I’ve been struggling with for a long time, probably since college tbh or even earlier. I’ll leave out all the wild childhood details because frankly they don’t matter.

I’ve been living on my own now for a little over 3 years. When I first moved out on my own I was SO excited to be able to drink a glass of wine when I got home, smoke a joint, and hang out. And I did so, but it very quickly began to escalate to a bottle of wine sometimes every night after work. I was also having a lot of trouble transitioning out of the fun, partying, college stage of my life, so I was also getting black out almost every weekend. After a few months of this routine - little sleep, not feeling rested when sleeping, not eating well or enough, brutal hangovers several days of the week - I had an epiphany! I don’t have to do that! So I quit drinking during the week, but continued to drink too much on the weekends. In addition to the not drinking during the week and drinking (less) on the weekends, I adopted a pretty strict fitness routine of working out 4-6 days a week for 1-2 hours. I was doing very well, I even quit vaping, and then I ended up moving states again for my job. My routine fell apart.

And so - fast forwarding A LOT - I am totally out of a routine. I go to work every day (I work early hours) but tend to come home every night and have 2 drinks. Occasionally it will be 3, and then I hate myself enough the next day that I don’t do it again for a while. I also typically have 3-6 drinks Fri-Sun. I am not getting blackout frequently at all (maybe 2-3 times a year), but I have had ~3 incidents in the last 6 months that I end up throwing up at the end of the night or next morning from drinking too much, not eating enough, etc.

All that to say is that no one has called me out for a drinking problem, but I have also been hiding that I drink 1-2 drinks most week nights from my boyfriend and family. This is what makes it feel wrong.

I also feel that my life would be significantly improved without the necessity of nicotine and alcohol (I don’t find I have an issue with weed personally). I don’t have a job that I can leave suddenly and go to a rehab center, but I do feel that I have plenty of other resources to help if I truly do have a problem.

Can anyone advise? My parents have a severe alcohol decency, which is why I’m anxious about it. I don’t know what to do because it seems like I’m teetering, but not quite at a problem state.

1m2ltds,What did your DTs actually look like?,"I'm a pretty bad alcoholic, but I've never had DTs. Seeing my sister go through them, I know I never, ever want to experience that. No human on earth should. It's one of the few things I've witnessed that made me think, ""ok, maybe I actually really would not wish this on my worst enemy.""

I am fascinated by them though. One of the main things I really wonder about, is what exactly did you see when you had them? I know just googling the nature of the DT psychosis gives the typical rundown of psychotic/paranoid hallucinations: hostile entities, bugs and rats on walls/skin, hearing voices, etc.

Yet, among the historical and literary accounts I've read, it seems reports of a demon or monster like sight are quite common. My sister reports this: she was seeing a green demon man peeking at her from the corners of the house.

My interest comes from a place of someone who has studied hallucinations (in anthropology/history/literature, not clinically) in higher education in the context of psychedelics. I'm curious about trends and themes in DT hallucinations. Did you see a monster?",1752792414.0,1,2,alcoholism,addiction
1m1ozgh,Day 11 sober and in the hospital,"I (M36) made the decision to go cold turkey when my urine became almost brown and my eyes became a bright yellow color. Taking Gabapentin helped me to stay alcohol free to minimize the possibility of a seizure and cravings. It is day 11 that I’m sober and I’m in the hospital. I had to check into the ER per doctor’s order after my blood work came in, it was considered as a life or death situation. So, what led me to where I am?

I went back to drinking on the regular 2.5 years ago, normally drinking an average of 12 shots or vodka nightly. A few months ago, I was on on-off vodka benders. Meaning, I was drinking vodka from morning to night (even during work hours although I work from home). About 4 weeks, I noticed the edges of my eyes became a little yellow but it went away/came back. The last two benders (one lasted 6 days, the last one lasted 3 days) really did it for me. 

I checked to the ER Monday night, they took a cat scan. Yesterday they pumped out a bunch of fluid from my gut. Today I had scans of my heart and an MRI to check my liver. In addition to a suffering liver I have diabetes (this actually recently improved decently), high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Fortunately, there is no tumor in my liver and after a number of evaluations from liver experts, all that I have to do is take a steroid and get weekly blood tests. I was fearful for my life but I’m glad that of the decent news. Of all the money I spent on vodka, especially during benders, this hospital visit likely will cost significantly more.

Anyways, I just wanted to share my story and how much it sucks paying the price for drinking. All of this could’ve been avoided for free. But at least I took action and all signs point that I’ll be alright. Nothing serious like tumors or a liver transplant will be needed.

I know that I have a problem and had actually clean for like 6 months. 

It was the anniversary of my assault

I just couldn't get out of my head about what he did to me

So I drank on my day off

I know,  horrible choice 

I also hadn't slept in days because of this. 

So once sufficiently drunk, I fell asleep

I woke up abd panicked that I was late for work. I threw clothes on and got on the car.  I had never gone to work intoxicated for the record,  not that that changes anything. 

I was a minute away from work when a car crossed over 3 lanes into the turn lane and my drunk ass rear ended her.

Obviously the cops came. My BAC was out of control.  I passed literally every test except the physical ones. 

Went to station, spoke to the magistrate via zoom, went to holding blah blah blah

So long story short (obviously it's not short, but it definitely could be longer)

My attorney advised that I go to a treatment facility (AKA rehab) for 30 days to help me possibly avoid a major amount of jail time.

I leave this Sunday. I am terrified. I have to fly on my own as though my partner has to work and cannot take the day off to drive me.  

The facility actually sounds very nice,  but I don't know if I can handle group therapy.  I had and awful experience with it when I was around 14.

1m1locp,90 days today. But it's getting harder.,"Hi everyone. Never ever did I believe I would be posting this on a forum. I have been drinking pretty much since my son was born 18 years ago. It started with a couple of glasses of wine a night and soon delevoped into a bottle and then 2 bottles.  I have been physically aggressive to my husband during this period and he has been physically aggressive back. (He doesn't drink) But my behaviour while drunk has led him to do things he never would have done to me. 
 Lately it has been all me though and I started to scare myself with what I was capable of while drunk. He had me arrested a few years ago but spending 18 hours in a police cell still wasn't enough of a wake up call. Earlier this year I stabbed a door with a knife when he locked it and that was the final straw for him. He walked out. Two days later I quit alcohol and I've been sober ever since. 90 days today! I have tried to quit several times with my longest stint being 89 days which was a couple of years ago. However, I thought I could go back to having a couple of drinks. But I can't. I just relapse back into 2 bottles of wine a night within days. 
My husband came back and we have been trying to work things out but it's not working out and he has decided to move out. This has left me devastated and I am struggling to keep it together. Up until now I have had no cravings at all. Him leaving and me scaring myself gave me the jolt I needed to change. But I'm scared now that all of this with him moving out is going to make me relapse.

But I relapsed shortly after a rehab visit, and went almost immediately into my old state of things and went into drinking 12+ pints of beer a day with god knows how much kratom. 

This immediately caused me to lose my girlfriend of a year, and a very high paying job of a year. I have to be out of my apartment that I put a lot of love into by the end of the month. Just cant afford it. 

All this spiralled into doing a 4 day bender of coke and probably about 20 beers at least a day. I was barely eating already but didn't drink water for 2 days. Didn't eat for 4. 

I was barely able to get sober just enough before this bender to drive my ex to rehab but now after about a week from my bender I have barely been able to eat and wake up so sick I throw up and dry heave even when i try to get water down. Been slowly weening down but i woke up with body aches and sweating and heart pounding and had to take a Zofran just to get water and a couple beers down. After a bit of kratom and 3 pints of beer the pain is gone but I'm just exhausted. And I just cant even fathom eating. 

There are no actual detoxes in my state. Just super expensive rehab but I gotta find a way to sober up enough to renew my DL that I lost, rent a uhaul and storage, and put everything in storage and drive back home all detoxed enough to get it done in time to be moved out by end of month. 

God save me. I'm exhausted but cant sleep. I thought I had the flu but it was me weening too quick off both the alcohol and kratom, and recovering from no food or water and now I can really only get down water and beer.

I’ve never found myself drinking to “numb pain”. I also never drink at home or drink alone or in secret. It’s not something I’d ever feel a craving to do unless I’m with a friend. However, that’s not to say that I’m not the first person to suggest going for a drink if a friend wants to make plans. 

I really, really enjoy these post work evenings catching up with friends over a drink. I do find that I never know when to stop though. I drink spirits, which get me drunk quite quickly. I’d maybe hit 3 a night as my friends are on beers and it doesn’t click to me that obviously despite them also having 3 drinks, mine have a much higher ABV. 

I so look forward to going out and chatting with a drink but give myself complete and utter guilt trips every day. I constantly tell myself I’m an alcoholic. It doesn’t help that my friends always say I’m so reliable and am always up for a great time and jokingly talk about how much I enjoy drinking. It’s completely eating me up, even though I don’t particularly consider myself as someone dependant on alcohol. The only time I’d ever consider using alcohol as a tool would be possibly before heading on a first date to settle some jitters. It’s never crossed my mind to go and drink by myself if none of my friends are around or before something important. 

I’m so wrapped up by this idea that I’m an alcoholic because I drink quite a lot and do enjoy it. Again though, as much as I enjoy it, to me it feels like I much more enjoy the social aspect. I spent a lot of my teenage years quite excluded from friend groups I didn’t realise were toxic at the time. Now, I’m finally surrounded by some of the best friends I could ask for and I think I’m just so desperately afraid of missing out or “being left out” again — even if it’s by saying no to plans and “leaving myself out.

I called the crisis center that the place I go to for my psychiatrist(who dropped me because they put me in a program for alcohol) recommended when I told them I needed help with withdrawal. They told me I need a psychiatrist in order to be admitted. So I went to the place where I start my new program with a psychologist, was assigned a case worker. She tried calling a ton of rehab facilities and NONE had a bed available. So she told me to go to the ER. I decided to. I waited 6 hours there and they finally gave me some detox medication. So far, I have not craved alcohol while on them. I am curious how that works. I was given meds for three days and I’m just hoping it helps me. The hospital also ran tests on me and found that all my organs are running fine so I have not damaged my body as of right now which was nice to hear.

This time I saw my doctor and spilled the beans. Gave exact details on my drinking habits. Of course the doctor basically nodded and said “well yeah, based on bloodwork you’re anemic.” He took my blood pressure and it was alarmingly high. Both these diagnoses explain why quitting in the past would make me feel so awful that it felt like the only solution was to just have another drink.

Well, this time I’m on blood pressure meds, iron pills and some other supplements recommended by doc and wow… I feel normal (ish) when sober. No light headed where I feel I might faint. Minimal heart palpitations. This is so much easier.

1m1a12j,"Alcohol Withdrawal, Switching To Beers To Taper Off Liquor","First off thanks for any help I can get from here.

This is my first ever reddit post. So bare with me.

I have had 2 seizures in 3 years from trying to quit alcohol cold turkey. But it was always after drinking lots of liquor for a long time. A handle a day at times. 

  
I recently got off a 2 week bender of doing the same thing with a handle of whiskey. I have had some symptoms of withdrawal for sure but I am afraid of another seizure happening so I have been drinking beer. Well...White Claws specifically. 5% alcohol. I was still getting withdrawal symptoms after 7 white claws (Vomiting, Sweating, Shakes). 

  
So I am wondering how many of these things should I be drinking to taper off of a handle of liquor ever 2 days this time around. I don't really have the desire to do a detox at a clinic. That made me just stress out way too much. Overthinker here. 

  
The twist is right now I actually have a torn Achilles with another month on the couch before I can get back to work. So I figure this was the right time to try and do it. I can keep track of it properly and I'm not out and about at bars. I'm literally Netflixing and playing League of Legends all day.

  
I know its an issue but this is my way to fix it. Just seeing if anyone else switched from a LOT of liquor a day to beer and still had withdrawals. 

  
Thanks in advance!

1m13veu,Partner might be an alcoholic?,"I have no idea where to from here. We’ve been together about 3.5 years (both 35 years old). We moved in together about a year and a half ago, I moved into his place when his best friend moved out (who also happened to be an alcoholic/cocaine addict but has been sober about 1.5 years now). He can drink a lot, and I always thought it was a normal amount for a man of his height and weight, just social drinking but maybe a bit extra and never getting blackout drunk in front of me, being messy, getting cut off etc. It always seemed like a regular amount for someone in our age group who works in hospitality. 

The odd time I’d see him go too far, but we always talked about it and he would show regret and embarrassment. There was a time when he took a bottle of whiskey I was given as a work Christmas gift and drank the majority of it; I was incredibly angry. I know he has PTSD from sexual abuse as a child/young adult and this often came up as a coping mechanism. I can never get him to talk too much about it but I understand, and I always tried to relate as I have my own traumas of the past. It always seemed like he was okay with the odd slip up. 

In the past 6 months it just seems like he’s getting worse. On his days off he buys a few six packs or bottles of wine and always claims he’ll just have a few at home and save money, it’s his Friday/Saturday night etc. I usually work on those nights and I’ve noticed he’ll sneak out after I’ve gone to bed and go to bars (usually after midnight). There’s been times he’s wet himself, which he has said is physical trauma from his abuse, he can’t “hold it in” as long as most people can (which does show up when he’s sober, to be fair). 
Lately on his nights off he’ll do nothing but okay video games and drink, go out and drink, buy takeout, pass out and go to work on like 4 hours of sleep. 

I’ve given him so many chances. I’ve been gentle, I’ve tried to get him to explain, I call him out. I try to talk to him and he shuts down. He claims he doesn’t know how to express himself and can’t explain what’s happening, he says one or two drinks is impossible for him because it’s a trigger into binge drinking. We don’t go out as often as we used to, and I don’t really drink at home, but I have no idea what to do anymore. I come home and he’s just blacked out on the couch, and then he brushes it off and says he needs to change. I’ve reached out to his brother multiple times to talk to him but I don’t think he does much other than checking in. I’m at the point where I want to tell his parents. He talks about us getting married someday but I can’t handle this stress anymore, every week I’m exhausted at having to deal with this over and over again. I love him but is it time to plan an intervention? He has a steady job with a high position, it’s not like he shows up to work drunk, but this binge drinking is out of control now. I just can’t handle this alone anymore and I don’t want to tell my close friends either. ",1752641932.0,2,11,alcoholism,addiction

She’s currently living in like a half way house situation but she’s relapsed again. I noticed a few things that were off last week(not replying to my messages or answering calls all night which was unusual) and tried to support her and ask if everything was fine which she assured me it was and that she just fell asleep early. 

Long story short, she relapsed last night and told me by sending a message saying she was wasn’t okay and then switched her phone off. Lunch time today I got a message saying she was at the pub and needed help and that she isn’t well. I’ve had to put in a boundary so I told her I can’t do this anymore as it’s mentally exhausting for me.

1m0y4jy,Insight please,"Just need some insight

Hello, internet

I am a 36yo (m) who has been drinking alcohol since the age of 14. My relationship with alcohol has always been that of a social drinker, that is until the pandemic. 

During the pandemic I found myself not being able to get my hands on any weed (my drug of choice) and turned to the available everyday, everywhere, alcohol!

Since then my tolerance for alcohol has grown significantly to the point where I could if I choose to, take down a 750ml within a night give or take a few drinks. 

 My body started to disagree with my new found liking to the sauce, in the way of: extreme weight gain, (I am 5’ 11” and was 185lb-190lb) to now almost 290lb. As well as some blood work that I had done that said that I was on my way to developing fatty liver disease. 

I have since limited my amount of intake in quantities but not in totality. My consumption went to drinking a few ciders (4 at max) and a shots of tequila (3 at max) either every other night or every night on occasion. Let me emphasize night, I dont start drinking until around 3pm. 

This is at the point where my wife becomes pregnant with our first child. To which she asks me to tone down my intake. 

I tone down my drinking on most nights, however not all. I also find myself drinking more on the nights I am allowed. To the point of becoming sloppy. 

I rein that in and find a comfortable medium, where we both agree it’s not “sober” but it’s respectable. 

Our daughter is born!

I am still drinking.

Now back to the amount I was before she was born, a few ciders and a shot or two. Again almost every night. 

Now, jump forward. She is a year old and I have been in this same cycle. 

Please give me some insight to how I should approach my current situation. 

I do but don’t want to quit. I want to go back in time and learn moderation. Is that possible? Should I just stfu and realize that I am an alcoholic and be a man/father/husband and do something about myself?

I’m recovering from unmedicated bipolar with schizoaffective, and severe alcohol use disorder. Went to a facility earlier this year, but began to drink again and destabilized myself. 

I started this job and on day three I was at my limit of stress. The job was not for me and I was miserable. I began to drink, after work and also before it. Then a day later, during it. And then always during it. 

When I’m drunk I act wild now, I think due to the bipolar since I didn’t use to act wild. But regardless, genius me kept taking merchandise we were giving out. I don’t even like the merch nor want it.

Ive hit a pretty solid rock bottom,and though reluctant, Ive made the decision I need to get better for probably the 10th time,but I want it to stick for good.

At the time of posting,I am 5 days sober.

Im 26 years old,and had previously never had an issue with alcohol,was more into weed (which ive also recently quit) until about 6 years ago around when the pandemic started.
Im not sure if this will reach anyone,and truthfully its okay if it doesnt, because I just need to vent/keep myself accountable. Every time I've tried to quit,I quit for a week or 2 and then find myself thinking ""just a few wont hurt"",and end up over doing it *Every single time* 🤦🏽‍♀️
If this does reach some people that have any tips or coping mechanisms for getting sober,I encourage you to share.

This is the longest I’ve been without a drink since I couldn’t tell you when. I’m using the “I Am Sober” app to track my cravings, moods, and emotions. I’m being more frank and honest with my husband and therapist. I’ve been in contact with a couple of people from my AA group for accountability. It feels different this time, but I hesitate to say that because I’m terrified of failing. 

Some days are a breeze, some days not so much. It feels dangerous and scary on the days when I start trying to bargain with myself on how I’ve earned a drink. I know all it takes is that first sip and then I’m right back on that wheel of bingeing and blacking out for days on end. I’m so scared of going back there. 

I’ve thrown myself into self-care. I’m back at the gym. I’m rewarding myself with cute new dresses and jewelry. Really trying to focus on bettering myself and feeling good in my skin instead of numbing it and hiding it with alcohol. I realized that at 32 I don’t really know who I am. I’ve spent the last 10 years self-medicating with alcohol. I’m excited to get to know myself for the first time without the booze haze.

1m07hab,Help as a family member dealing with denial,"Hi,

I hope this isn't out of place, because I'm at my wit's end.

I've been watching my 65 yr old mother's slow descent towards alcoholism for years now. She's always used alcohol to deal with her stress, but I feel like it's been getting out of hand. I don't live with her, I'm multiple hours drive away, but when I visit, she will not go a day without drinking (multiple glasses). When she visits me, she expects there to be wine and, if not, will go out and buy some.

She spent a week at a muslim country a year ago and came back complaining up and down that she couldn't drink in public with her meal and had to hide in her room (rationalized the complaint by calling the country hypocritical for these rules, seeing as it's a country that also produces wine). In January, she and I went abroad on a once in a lifetime trip, and she brought a bottle of whisky out of fear she wouldn't enjoy the local spirits.

More recently, she's been dealing with real estate struggles; I've not had one single video call where she didn't have a glass in hand, sometimes stopped to refill.

She's pushed away most of the people who stand up to her, and even maligned and pushed away some that didn't, because she needed a scapegoat for her ill-being. That leaves few people around, and even fewer people willing to call her out on the drinking. Years ago, I asked a cousin for help in an intervention: she refused out of fear of retaliation. 'You know how your mother can get mean,' she said. I myself have tried to gently point it out to my mother, and suggest therapy multiple times. (Sometimes I've been dismissed, sometimes I got verbal backlash)

She's in complete denial. I live away (and wouldn't move closer for my own survival, to be frank). I have no idea what to do.

What can I do? What were your wake up calls, to get out of the denial phase? Should I call her doctor and at least warn him so he can keep an eye out for health issues?",1752550815.0,0,2,alcoholism,addiction

1lz8az3,"I'm trying to understand BAC - Cause for a heavy drinker, it doesn't make sense..","I was a very heavy drinker, at my worst I was drinking 3-4 fifths a day. The first time I stopped (tried to stop) drinking, I didn't even know withdraw was a thing, I didn't really understand BAC other than that 0.08 was over the legal limit.

So, fast forward 5 years later (not 5 years sober 😞) and I know a lot more. That first time in the hospital when I was going through withdraw, my BAC was 0.63 (not 0.063) but it was, I dunno.. 6 or 7 in the evening and I hadn't had a drink since maybe 10 or 11pm the night before. 

I drove myself to the ER. I remember everything. I was completely coherent. Other than feeling like I was going to die from trembling and my heart exploding, sweating, and all that, I felt sober.

I was using one of those BAC calculators to kind of see what my BAC would have been the day before when I was drinking. My typical day was a fifth in the morning, a fifth in the afternoon, and a fifth in the evening. That day, I'd had an extra fifth because my boyfriend and I had game night and he bought me one on the way home (can't let it sit there, ya know). So the calculator I used lets you put in the times for all your drinks and when I did it, it said my BAC would have been 2.3 at it's peak -- I mean..

I googled and there's articles about a couple people with record BACs of like 1.2 or something around there caught with DUIs. So, that can't be right... Right? Or is this just something that doesn't get talked about or seen because we're closet drinkers, it's not measurable, or maybe the more you drink it actually doesn't get that high? Your BAC levels start to slow down maybe so it never really gets that high and the calculator is just that, constant variable not expecting someone to be calculating that much. Or when your tolerance goes up, your BAC takes longer to get higher?

Surely, I'm not the only one to drink that much and have an experience similar to this. I know it's quite a lot and not the norm for an alcoholic but I know there's plenty of us out there that have drank like me..

So, does anyone know? Is that even possible? A 2.3 BAC? Cause that don't sound right at all.",1752452614.0,3,29,alcoholism,addiction

Here I am house sitting for my older sister who doubles as my best friend. Today I am six months clean from anything, this is the longest I’ve ever gone if I’m honest. It’s been one hell of an experience. Last year I got divorced, which I drunkenly asked for and got. Felt more like I had to divorce his overbearing mother more than him because he was a total mama’s boy. I asked him for help with my disease but I feel like “it wasn’t what he signed up for” so after that I spiraled even further. Living alone in a small studio in my favorite city, I should have had it made. But the drinking just ramped up since I no longer had to hide it. It took for me to have a seizure, cracked head, visit to the psych ward, straight to inpatient, to sober living, outpatient and now staying at my mom’s house to finally commit to sobriety. It’s been a wild ride but I’m grateful for everything around me. My family stills loves me, hell my sister is letting me watch her place unsupervised and I believe I destroyed so much emotion of hers through the process of all this. For the first time in my life, I am in control. Honestly, I was a serial monogamist who always relied on a man. Now it’s just me, my sobriety and my precious old hag of a dog (bless her) I can truly say I am happy, I’m not remotely the same girl I was six months ago. I had to do all kinds of suffering to get here but well worth it. My favorite quote I’ve heard so far is- for every alcoholic getting sober, there’s ten people who sleep better.

I just think of how good I'll feel, I also think of how much I want to stop and how much it's hurting my body and progress and causes me to binge junk food. I think how ima feel so guilty and anxiety filled when it's over and I still choose to go out my way and get alcohol.

Over the last month I've been smoking weed way more often as well, I feel like I was just completely sober and had no urges or thoughts other than progress, gym, work, health, and now I feel like im just constantly trying to make it through each day and trying to get back to where I was. Its so hard to imagine never drinking again, and ill level with myself by saying maybe ill just try and drinking once a month or maybe once I get a streak going again I can reward myself with a night of fun and it just never ends. 

Is there any suggestions for getting back on the wagon and staying there? If something reminds me of drinking, like gaming, should I completely avoid it ?  This whole month sucked, and all I've done is spent money I dont have, feeling like crap mentally and physically every morning, feeling so guilty just to go back and forth over and over, im more distant to my gf, im getting fat and losing my gym progress, im just always chasing getting normal and always getting no where",1752461108.0,1,4,alcoholism,addiction

1lyumwq,I don't know where to start,"I've always been joking that I'm a functioning alcoholic, because my drinking doesn't affect my professional or personal life in a negative way. I'm very successful in my career, have a relationship, though not a great one, take care of my finances, pets and everything else. I'm not a mean drunk, I get genuinely happy, talkative, and relaxed.   
  
However, I'm getting to the point where it's no longer a joke. I don't like the way I look, my face is bloated, and I don't really feel in control. The thing is, I don't want to drink as much as I do, but I also don't want to quit. I know I can be without drinking, I've done it before, but most of the time I just don't want to. Even when I tell myself ""I won't drink today,"" I come up with an excuse that will justify having a beer. Even then, I usually don't stop at one, so I end up having 4-5 beers daily. It's much easier for me not to drink at all than to only have one. 

I'd like to make changes, but I'm not sure where to start. The only person holding me accountable is myself, and well, that's not working. I've been wondering why I feel the need to drink everyday, and I think it might be boredom, maybe some anxiety. But even when I plan my nights to keep busy, I still find an excuse to end the day with a night cap.

1lypeyd,How to Help My Girlfriend with her binge drinking,"My (41M) GF (36F) and I have been dating for several years now and moved in together over a year ago. We share a household that includes 4 kids (ages 8-16) and 3 cats. I feel that we have a very good partnership and we split the household responsibilities well.

My problem is that when she has access to alcohol, she can’t seem to help herself and will drink a lot more than I consider reasonable. For example, I like to have “a beer” with dinner, so I might bring a six pack home. We both have a beer with dinner and then I wake up the next morning to find the six pack gone because she drank the rest of it by herself. This has happened multiple times with multiple types of alcohol (beer, wine, liquor) that she’s had access to. She’s only 115 lbs and it seems like having 3-6 drinks at a time is really excessive.

Now she doesn’t do this every night, which is why I think she doesn’t think she has a problem. But she also doesn’t have access to alcohol daily (I keep the liquor cabinet locked and don’t bring it home that much because of her binging), but I still think her inability to control her drinking when alcohol is available is a problem.

I’ve asked her before why she drinks so much as she says she doesn’t know. I worry about the damage that this binge drinking will do to her long term. Is there anything that I could do or say to her to help convince her that this is a problem? Thanks for any advice and insight!",1752401884.0,3,11,alcoholism,addiction

1lyhzx1,How do I help my alcoholic mother?,"If this is the wrong place for a post like this, I'm really sorry, I wasn't sure where else to post this or who to ask but I had to reach out for help. This is going to be a long one but I kinda feel like its all relevant information in reference to the type of person my mom is...

TLDR: My mother is an alcoholic, has had a liver transplant, and still won't stop drinking. Is there anything I can do to force help onto her?

Not TLDR: I (27F) live in Tucson, AZ and my mom (50F) lives in Pheonix, AZ. My mom is a lifetime abuser of street drugs, alcohol, and prescription medication. When I was 19 years old, she got really bad, drinking multiple bottles of vodka a day. She lost her job, didn't pay rent for months, and was getting evicted. So on Thanksgiving Day she hopped on a plane, flew out to South Carolina, and I didn't hear from her for 3 years. 

When I was 22 I recieved a call from a South Carolina number. It was my mom. She was calling from a hospital because her liver was failing her and she couldn't get on state insurance because she had just been fired from her job. She was trying to get away from a boyfriend who was beating her and wanted to move to a state with lower qualifications to get on state insurance. I was married and living in in a 600 sqft one bedroom duplex. I didn't have room for her but I felt that there really wasn't another option. So I spent ALOT of money to get her out to me (long story but basically she was abusing prescription drugs and it made it hard to move her). 

I finally got her out here and eventually got her qualified for insurance. She lived with me for about a year, which put a major strain on my marriage. I'm now divorced (happily) but I can't say that a large part of it wasn't because of my mom. A little after a year of living with me, she started declining rapidly health wise. She was hospitalized and my brother and I sat in her hospital room all day, every day for a month while the doctors kept her alive. She became unresponsive and the doctor told me to start planning her funeral. But then she started to bounce back, and at the last minute the hospital was able to get a donor liver and she recieved her transplant. She actually lied to my brother and I about the surgery date so she could fly her abusive boyfriend from SC out to be present during it. And then she moved in with him once she was released from the hospital.

My mom has mental health issues. She has refused therapy and psychiatry, so she is not diagnosed with anything, but I know she has a lot of trauma from her younger life that eats her up inside. She is not a happy woman. 

Currently she has been fired from 2 jobs in the last 4 months for being drunk while at work. She will go on benders for a month, show up at my house, go into withdrawals for the night, then go home and get drunk again. She will drunk call or text me every day talking about how she can't stand her boyfriend because he beats her and wants to move in with me. How she is going to straighten out and do the right thing.

This all is starting to wear on my current relationship.

I just got off the phone with her. She is so drunk she can hardly speak. She said her boyfriend beat her the night over something, and that he was getting home from work so she would call me in the morning.

There has to be something I can do to help her. I can't move her into my house again. I can't call the cops about the domestic violence, she will just deny it and then he will beat her more. Has anyone dealt with this before? What did you do? Is there a government service that could intervene? Rehab hasn't worked for her. A near death experience hasn't worked for her. An intervention hasn't worked for her. Is there anything else I can do? She is going to kill herself on her current path.

I'll appreciate any advice given.

For awhile there it felt like a demon took over my body and actively tried to ruin my life. I burned every bridge i have and now live in my car. I lost everything. But i have a smile on my face because i know the demon is gone, it cant hurt me anymore. Now the only way to go is up.

 Maybe i can repair some stuff but i think most bridges should probably just stay burned. Im too embarrassed and guilt ridden to even talk to anyone anymore. New expirences for me for awhile i guess. 22 years old. Ive got pleanty of time. And to think 2 weeks ago i tried to kill myself. Ha.

45 years ago this morning, around 4am PA time, my father finally succumbed to alcoholism. I'd seen him the night before in ICU, & the last words I heard him say were ""Yellow thing,"" as he pointed to a small plastic container so he could throw up blood in it. The sheets were getting red with his blood. His stomach was distended like he had Kwashiorkor, his legs & ankles swollen several times what they should be, & dark with bruises. Pretty much everywhere on his 6'4 frame was in bad shape. Doctors shooed me out shortly after.
I took the elevator up to his room & took home the plants people had given him. I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt he was going to die. Walked out to the parking lot in the dark & drove home with that sinking feeling, the dread of this is it. He's gone. He's finally gone now. I had one of those plants, a big spiky thing, into my 30s until it took finally died. I resented that thing but watered it. It probably needed more sun.

His Esophagus had ruptured. He'd been in the hospital about a month & was recovering. I found a glass behind a curtain in his room one day when I visited. Filled with yellow liquid. I didn't smell it. He saw me pick it up & told me to put it back down, so I did. I don't know who was sneaking him what I now think must have been Scotch. I was all of 18, born & raised with alcohol as the backdrop to my entire existence. I never knew him sober. My mother still drinks daily. I don't drink. Why bother? I knew in elementary school it wasn't something I could ever do, because look at the goddamn wreckage it brings.

Scotch ruined my family. There was more, but drinking killed the family. I last saw my mother around 1991. Went 17 blissful years NC with her. My brother I last spoke to around 1992. He lives in a different country & periodically sends me unhinged, hateful emails I don't respond to. Neither has my number. At 63, I can still cry just thinking about how sad it all was. Is. What a life, going through life without a family, because of course I never had my own nor bothered to get married. Cats. It's all cats.

He's now been dead longer than he was alive. He died barely 44. Hey, that was some dedicated J&B drinking, huh. He should get some posthumous award for determination to exit this life, because wow, that worked for him. 

So to my father John's bones, mouldering in that brass or whatever casket at the Denver cemetery, hope it was all worth it. I'm sorry you couldn't deal with whatever ghosts you came into this life with, I'm sorry & angry you felt the need to molest me all those years, I'm sorry I was born to you. I hope you do better next time around if you get another chance. That's all.

I felt the urge coming around 10:00pm, looked at the clock and noted that my “dealer” (the local grocery store that sells beer and wine AND has an actual bar inside the store 🙄) was open for another hour. I could get there in less than 8 minutes. Decided that I’d wait 10 minutes and see how I felt and if I still wanted to go get wine then, I could go get it ….. then after those 10 minutes I promised myself I could go get wine after I folded the load of laundry waiting in the dryer….. then I could go after I cleared out all the expired condiments from the refrigerator door…… then I could go after I made myself a heated-up snack (missed dinner tonight). Then suddenly it was 10:55pm and oh well, I couldn’t make it to the store in time, 😉🤷🏽.

It was a little mind game, and it helped. What I think made it workable was that I REALLY meant it….. if after each task I’d actually decided I wanted to go to the store for wine, I decided I would do it. I meant it, it was an honest choice after each task/pause. But at the end of each task I asked myself, “Think of how GREAT it felt to wake up this morning with no headache and no regrets or worry? No nausea?….. how would you like to feel like that again tomorrow and not waste a whole Saturday depressed and ashamed with a hangover?”  And I want that.

1lxryky,Looking for graphic novel illustrator for substance use disorder youth prevention plan/script,"I wrote a substance use disorder youth prevention plan for middle schoolers that I would like to publish as a book/workbook that includes a graphic novel script, which was generated using Gemini (I pasted my plan into the search engine and it generated a complete 6 chapter script) that I now need someone to bring to life for me using either AI or manual illustration  (using the scripts detailed directions for the imagery) so I can try and get it published all as one book. The goal is to offer it to middle school districts to offer it to be used as supplemental material for their substance use prevention education in the classroom. Does that make sense? Basically I need someone to read the graphic novel script thats provided, that has all the details of how it should look and what the characters should be saying in each panel, and then make it real so I can publish it all as one book for kids to use in class. The prevention plan was developed by me all on my own time, its 12 pages long. The graphic novel script is 23 pages long. Im a substance use disorder counselor who also has a daughter about to enter the 6th grade.

I recorded the conversation and he pretended he didn't say what he did, and then he said he only said what he said to make her feel better.  Before that we were in conflict as we always are when he drinks: he tries to get physically close to me and talk to me and I tell him to leave me alone and that I'm not talking with him about anything until tomorrow when he's sober.

He did in the past few months have a similar drunk phone call with someone and asked them when's the last time they had had sex.  I asked him about it and he blew it off.

We've been married 3 years.  

What do you think his behavior means?  I'm not an idiot, I assure you, but specifically how much if at all does his being drunk ""explain"" what he did and how much risk do you think there is (be honest but please be kind) that he would say the same thing to that person or someone else?

The critical introspect is mostly gone at this point. When I started this journey it was primarily motivated by ""not dying"". I was sick, weak and tired in the months leading up to July 11th 2021. 

In my personal opinion, many addictions can blur their boundaries with one another. We find ourselves drawing a hard line between substances as if any of them are truly any better than the other. If you do just a little bit of research you'll find that addiction isn't mutually exclusive to ""mind altering substances"" and that we are all uniquely driven by the dopamine in our brains. That reward cycle is the only thing perpetuating our chronic use of anything.

I can't sit here and pretend that my decision to completely eliminate alcohol from my life has made ME a better person. A lot of my bad habits remain, and I may have perfected some new ones. Us alcoholics sure do love our sugar (that's tied to your dopamine also). Alongside the immediate rewards we seek out through ""little treats"", I think it's very possible and perhaps more rewarding to compartmentalize life as larger chunks of moments in time. Why is it ""one day at a time"" and not ""one moment at a time""?

This entire conversation and it's extremities could go on for hours. For me, it's difficult to quantify exactly how much alcohol holds you back. One might latch on to the concept that they aren't an alcoholic ""because""...      because what?? Why even test the theory when we know MORE than just ""alcohol is bad for you"". 

IT STOPS ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS AND MOMENTUM IN AN INSTANT. 

I've seen the benefits first hand and it doesn't stop with just me. I've met so many people who have joined this journey, before & after I did, who have also proven to themselves and others that life is better without alcohol. Life is better without addiction to things that distract us from our purpose. You can try to manage the dangerous ones, but why?

Please, if you THINK you have a problem with drinking I want you to talk to me.

1lxujfa,who can go to rehab?,"Sorry in advance for the long post...tldr: I feel too young and like an inadequate addict for rehab. Do you think certain people aren't, for lack of a better word coming to mind, *qualified* to go?

Ok, obviously anyone with the means can technically go to rehab. But I feel a level of guilt about even considering it as an option. I'm young (21f) and don't feel I struggle with addiction to the degree so many addicts do. Maybe I'm in denial. Probably. 

For context: I've been drinking for about 4 years. I started *relatively* late. But addiction runs in my family, and by the point I did pick up drinking I'd already been blowing through gram-wax-pens every 4 or 5 days for a year. I still smoke, daily. There have periods where I drink less, but they're few and far between. When I do consume alcohol, it's most often to get drunk -- and on the rare occasion it's not, I end up in that state anyway. I hide drinks at social functions, usually doubling what people think I'm drinking in secret. I drink alone. I stole alcohol regularly before turning 21. When I was 19 I tried a couple AA meetings. The old guy leading the sessions came up to me after one asking my age. I felt super out of place. Like, these people had really struggled. Who am I to be here?  Last year, my parents found 10 or so empty wine bottles in my closet. An intervention took place, but nothing about my behavior changed. Two years before the intervention I was on a fishing trip with my aunt, a recovering alcoholic. Everyone drank but I was the only kid, per say. I drank a lot. So much so, my aunt talked to me privately about worrying about it -- she thought I'd be in rehab already. Her wife told me later, ""you'll pickle your liver before you're 22."" 

I don't want that. Admittedly though, that's not why I'm considering rehab. I'm moving across the country in a month or so and my parents are still actively worried about my substance abuse. I don't want to leave them with that fear lingering. But honestly, I don't feel like *enough of an addict* to go. I know that's silly. And largely inaccurate. I just feel like I'd be taking up space that's not mine to inhabit. Then, I'm afraid that I'll self-sabatoge instead -- until I get to a point where rehab really does seem like the only option. And that'd just be wasted time. 

I don't know. Am I being over dramatic? Over-thinking it, (as the length of this text would indicate)? Under-thinking it? Have you felt this way? Were you wrong?

Was drinking against my will and just could not stop. It took police intervention to get me some dry time, then I got home and had about 5 days of withdrawal. 

Got 1 month sober again today though. Back in the rooms and properly engaging with the steps with my sponsor and doing what’s suggested this time. Put effort into finding my own higher power and have started praying 3-4 times a day, reading the big book and really taking it in. Have started actually sharing back in meetings too (never did this before) and making more of an effort to talk to people. 

I’m trying to take the positives from the relapse. I’m lucky it was only a month, that I’m still alive and that I’m not in prison/hospital. and it’s only confirmed to me 100% I cannot drink normally. No matter how much I change, age, how much exercise, work and therapy I do, I will never be able to drink. 

But I regret that it took what it did for me to find that out. When I’m in blackout I say and do things I would never dream of when sober, and I have the ability to absolutely crush people.

I made a post here at abt 4 days sober so I decided to make one at 34. 

Week 1-2 were pretty funky. It was the smoke clearing after detox, the “what now?” feeling that hit me. that was the moment I truly realized my life *was unmanageable.*

I started to put in the work- mostly on external, I will admit. I decided to switch gears and withdraw from uni to go to community college. I got a part time job. I deep cleaned my apartment from top to bottom. I was just totally obsessive with staying busy, which honestly at the time I think was best for me; but I’d neglected my step work quite a bit and lost sight of the bigger picture. 

I attended my first AA meeting in about 2 weeks yesterday, and the topic just felt SO pointed to what I’ve been going through and it was kind of one of those Deja vu moments where I felt like my higher power tapped me on my shoulder and was like “you’re here for a Reason!”. Most of them are much longer sober than I am, and spoke about the importance of working the steps & staying present in your recovery journey rather than letting it fall through the cracks of everyday life- leading into old habits and thinking patterns. I’m so grateful to have such an amazing AA group & sponsor honestly. I don’t speak much at meetings because im still working on getting out of my shell- but just being present and listening to shared experiences helps me so much and motivates me to keep coming back, work the steps & working on myself to gain the courage to share one day. 

For my 30 (it was technically 33 at this point lol) days, I spent the whole day just reflecting and being gracious for this second chance. I went to the pool, laid in the sun, looked at the clouds, birds, and airplanes in the sky. When I got too hot I’d do laps around the pool by myself (I probably looked crazy bc I’ve never been a strong swimmer). I scheduled a Pilates class I’d always wanted to try. I pierced my ears with a kit I’d bought an entire year ago n forgot about. 

All of the things I never had the capacity to do— because alcohol was always the first choice as a reward to myself. 

Finally Choosing myself and getting sober after 6 years has been the hardest yet greatest accomplishment of my life. I am so grateful for this second chance at life, to have a clear mind, a healthier body that gets stronger everyday, being present for my loved ones, and most of all a healing soul. It never felt like an option and now it finally does. It definitely hasn’t been easy but I wouldn’t have it any. Other. Way. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you for listening. I encourage you all to continue with your sobriety journey no matter where you’re at.

You’ll catch up and your surroundings will slowly become so clear and bright again. in just a small period of time, sobriety has given me a beautiful messy life that I’d never have imagined for myself, and it will for you too.

Today marks 12 days since my last drink. While it feels like such an accomplishment I am still filled with anxiety, regret, and fear for what’s to come. 

While I’m starting to get more mental clarity, I decided to go to the doctors since my drunk mind convinced me I never needed them. I was drinking 45 standard drinks a week. I’d spread them out to give myself days off so I normally binge drank the 45 drinks over 3 days. Mostly beer with some wine/mixed drinks mixed in. Drink Monday take off Tuesday. Drink Wednesday take off Thursday. You get the idea. I did that since the day I turned 21 a little over 9 years ago. 

I feel embarrassed. I’ve convinced myself my doctor is going to walk into the room and tell me that all my fun and games has gotten me cirrhosis. CIRRHOSIS. That word has given me so much anxiety the last week. Over the past 2 years I’ve been having acid reflux accompanied with an ache on my right side that comes and goes. I’ve also been getting doubts of dizziness sometimes. I’ve chalked all this up to cirrhosis. On top of that, I took my blood pressure for the first time in probably a decade. 134/98. No telling how long my blood pressure has been elevated and obviously it’s unmediated. So now I have high blood pressure that I’ll need to address.

Does this ever get easier? I haven’t had a drop in about two years and I just absolutely cannot stand being around other people. And when I am around other people I am just a fucking miserable piece of shit that goes around spreading misery and negativity.

I do not want to do this anymore. I don’t even have a craving for alcohol, I just have come to the realization that I am a middle aged alcoholic who no longer has the will to live other than sparing my immediate family from the trauma of my death.

I understand that alcoholism is a strong word, and that many who have found themselves in this situation likely had a much more severe dependence and addiction, so I want to be clear that I am not comparing.

I drink 5 nights a week, with the odd day or two in between. Most occasions, I consume between 3-4 beer (tall cans.) I do not drink excessively, however it is frequent. I’m torn between whether this is,in my mind, a NEED or if it’s just something I WANT. I’m not even sure there is a difference really?

A song came on today which I never really liked that much, but it reminded me of a time pulling into the driveway at my parents house. My mom was playing the song “Back in Black” by AC/DC incredibly loud as we came home from dinner. I just felt an overwhelming sense of regret and grief as this song played as I remembered this moment.

My mom died of breast cancer almost 2 years ago and I feel so much regret on all the time I wasted while she was alive. Even when I moved out at age 28 and would visit every Sunday I’d be drinking. We’d be playing music, smoking weed, eating dinner as a family and my sister and myself would be turning the fuck up. Of course it was a great time, but I wish I was more present. So many good memories I just don’t remember.

Even when my mom did chemo and radiation I was always drinking. Always emotionally distant and not the version I needed to be. My mom was in the hospital for 2 weeks before she died a horrific death. She couldn’t eat or drink water for 13 days and my family and I had the displeasure of watching her organs shut down until she died.

I feel so much shame and regret that I didn’t have the clarity I do now. It’s only been 53 days and I understand that this is just the beginning, but I wish she got to see this version of me.

1lvmmvv,Trying to explain to my Auntie that she can't take away my uncle's alcohol,"I live about two blocks away from my aunt and uncle.  I visit them from time to time.  My uncle is a heavy drinker and over the weekend my auntie had enough of him, so she took away his bottle while he was asleep.

The following morning, I called to check up on how they were doing. Luckily, I did.  She was telling me that she took away his bottle and he is still asleep.

As soon as I heard that, I rushed over to the house. I met my Auntie at the door.   We sat down at the table, and I waited for my uncle to wake up.

We quietly spoke about other things before I mentioned to her that she needs to give him back his bottle. My auntie scoffed at me.  She said I was encouraging his drinking habits.

I said no, it has nothing to do with that.  And she became mad at me for taking his side. My uncle woke up and it wasn't long before he started looking around for his bottle. At first, he said nothing. And then he asked his wife where the bottle is.  I started to see him starting to shake and his voice quivering.  My Auntie just sat there and said she don't know what he's talking about.

He went into the bathroom, came out, paced around. Opening up the cupboards and the fridge.

And then sat down on his recliner shaking. I immediately ran out to my car and fetched a bottle of scotch whiskey I brought with me. I ran back and poured him five shots in a row.    He was stabilized.

My Auntie was yelling at me.   Trying to take the Scotch away.   I told her, if I didn't have that bottle of scotch.

Uncle could go into a seizure.

She told me to get out of the house.  I try to explain to her again, over and over again.

And I was asked to leave to the house and my auntie called all my other relatives saying I was there encouraging his drinking.  I got scolded by my parents and everyone else.

And I sat here alone thinking to myself.  ""I am the bad person in all of this.""

How did I know how to react in that way?  because a doctor told me when I was hospitalized for a different incident involving an accident. He told me a story about his father when he sat there next to me. He got personal and talked about losing a loved one and I remembered it always and carried that with me.

The only way out of this is help or death.

1lw56jr,Will I experience withdrawal symptoms again? More details below,"Hi, I’ve realized over these past few months that I have a problem with drinking, as I only drink to get wasted. Like 8 days ago, I decided to take a break for a few days, and went through some withdrawals, such as excessive sweating, nausea/vomiting/acid reflux, and anxiety (with increased heart rate). These lasted about 2-3 days, other than the anxiety, which lasted a few more days. However, I’m a big over-thinker and  have struggled with anxiety most of my life. 

A few days ago, after having a break for I believe 5 days, I had one glass of wine. The following day, I had 2 1/2 glasses. When I got back to my apartment after being gone those two days, I got quite drunk from one mixed drink and two bottles of wine. Tonight, I had half a bottle, if not a little more than half, but did not end up drunk, as this was over about 3-4 hours.

My question is, will I experience withdrawals again if I decide to stop drinking starting tonight? I’d like to be able to gain control over my drinking as a 22 year old woman, which is the end goal, but if I can’t, I will have to choose sobriety. I don’t feel ready for sobriety quite yet, so cutting back is my goal.

1lvituv,"Quit drinking several days ago, I can’t sleep","I developed a mentality that I cannot drink for any reason at this point, after 2.5 years of binge drinking and about 4 months of on-off benders. My eyes were becoming yellow and the last thing I want is to apply further damage to my body which is the reason I quit cold turkey although I am taking gabapentin to help. The only issue is I am taking a generous dosage at night (900mg) and it is supposed to help me to sleep in addition to other things, yet the sleeping part isn’t working and I’m worried of upping the dosage because I don’t want the tapering of gabapentin to be so difficult.

I remember that and I hope I don’t have hate for this TMI but when I would withdraw when I would close my eyes, I would just see like figures of like people or things or whatever and it would be like the weirdest demonic things or like people doing you know what and I’m just digusted  it’s so Dark and demonic like I swear there’s so much more to life and I feel like that after dealing with withdrawals, I just had to get this off my chest lol",1752135006.0,0,29,alcoholism,addiction

1lvimce,Whatsup Gang,"
So, I have quite a strange one, I feel like. Also - I don’t mean to seem insensitive, I know there are people on here with serious alcohol abuse problems and I respect the sober journey even more now. But it might be what a lot of people feel so here goes. 

I haven’t told myself “I have to go sober I have to go sober” ever. I don’t get in trouble, I don’t necessarily take it “too far” or even get drunk. I do drink frequently like 2/3 glasses of wine per night. I do drugs, mostly ketamine and coke on the weekends, maybe a gram of each. I went through a stage where I would do some cocaine and produce music midweek for a while but I’d go to bed 3am at the latest and be ready for work the next day. I work a intense job in tech sales - in office. I train pretty hard and I have a side bussiness. I am in great shape and never really get depressed. I am quite literally after what I don’t know - I don’t know how ill feel with no drinking. 

I have a tendency to just stay up too late laughing with my mates or making music in the studio but its gotten better or worse not sure because ive moved out of town for work. Now when I see them its like a reunion everytime. 

I can easily go without alcohol for a few days and then I get excited for the weekend. It feels like its part of the excitement and not a coping mechanism to help with depression because im not depressed. But I do feel like there are health benefits to quitting alcohol. Maybe I should just learn to not overdo it? I have a family history of alcohol abuse on one side and I guess Im also just trying to figure out where I lie on that spectrum. 

Alcohol is also super socially acceptable in my country and even encouraged. Okay so what is my question - my question is, are there people on here unsure of weather they are an addict because they don’t absolutely send it to the moon every-time they drink alcohol but find it hard to completely quit because of excitement and social norms?",1752067211.0,4,3,alcoholism,addiction

1lurysg,Think he finally drank himself to death. I'm still in shock.," Sorry this is long. My cousin and best friend has been drinking nearly daily for 20 years, and drank before that but moved to liquor later on when we started hanging out. We would crush 1500ml of Whiskey every night and go work construction at 6am, Smelling like a brewery. But I finally quit drinking totally, and eventually came to really seriously dislike him when he was drunk like that. He had a name for that ""Alter Ego,"" even. Would beat his chest and growl, and if you said red he said blue... LoL. His daughter found him dead in bed yesterday morning. She went to wake him up.... And he was gone. He was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease, which is probably what actually caused him to have a heart attack in his sleep. He was 42 years old. And he is DEAD now. Not judging or preaching, but if you are still letting alcohol ruin you PLEASE get some help. I promise you won't like the ending to the road you are on. He was one of my only true, real friend too... Once his Mother died he kinda spiraled pretty bad. Was homeless, slept in my shop many nights, but always have that $9.62 for a 750ml bottle of R&R.

1lv1ti7,Looking for advice from people who understand better,"I (20F) have had an alcohol problem for around two years now. I started drinking my senior year of high school, and at my worst I was blacking out alone in my room more days than I was sober. About a month ago I opened up to my girlfriend about it. There had been several days where I would drink and not tell her, and my conscience caught up to me. I am so in love with this girl, I couldn't imagine walking down the aisle to marry her knowing all of the things I had deliberately hidden from her. She was really angry with me, rightfully so. But she wants to support me as best as she can.

Since then, I got the I am sober app and have started talking to a counselor weekly. Things were going really well. On the Fourth of July, I had one single drink at a family get together. And I was so proud of myself for having just the one. I had hope that I would be able to drink safely. 

Last night, my girlfriend and I were having a serious conversation (I wouldn't call it an argument, but we were getting frustrated with each other) about something separate. As soon as that conversation ended I knew I was going to drink.

Words cannot describe how badly I wanted to NOT drink. I was staring at a bottle of alcohol literally pleading with myself not to. I knew I would take it too far and regret it. And of course, I was right. The night ended with me throwing up and knocking out at 7pm. 

This morning, I told my girlfriend what happened. She was obviously really frustrated and disappointed. She wants me to get more people in my support system because she feels like it's all on her. But honestly, I don't know where to turn. First of all, multiple people in my family also have alcohol problems. There is always alcohol in my house and its very easy to take without anyone noticing because it is used up quickly anyway. But I also feel like I can't turn to my friends. I have a few friends that know I have an alcohol problem in the past and have reached out to me about it, and I feel so lucky to have people in my life that care about me that much. But it can be really frustrating trying to talk about addiction with someone who isn't an addict themselves. 

If I'm being honest, I usually drink because I want to feel bad for myself. I drink when I'm upset because I want to cry / use alcohol as a form of self harm. The vast majority of my drinking episodes happen when I'm alone. In those moments, I *do* want to reach out for help. But at the same time, I'm so ashamed of myself.

I really want to get better. Alcoholism goes back generations in my family and I know exactly where I will end up if I don't make a change. Right now I'm 20, and I'm terrified of what will happen when I turn 21 and can access alcohol whenever I want. I love my girlfriend so so so much and my substance use has been the only major problem between us. I know how it feels to see a loved one choose alcohol and I hate that I've put her in that position because she is everything to me.

As of right now, I'm trying to look at last night as just a bump in the road. But what do I do next time? I have self control until I'm alone and emotional and just wanting to do something harmful. The worst part is I *know* what I'm doing. I know the harm I'm causing myself and others. I tell myself all of the consequences while begging myself to not drink. But I do it anyway! I *have* healthy coping mechanisms. But when I'm at a low point, I ignore all of my logic and I have no one to hold me accountable in the moment. I feel like this is where I need advice from someone who understands addiction better. It's hard to explain to a non alcoholic that I HATE drinking. I don't like the way it makes me feel. I don't like the person it makes me. I don't want to be harming myself and others. But I still drink anyway!",1752012352.0,0,2,alcoholism,addiction

1lusj65,Did I fry my nervous system (and can it recover?),"Good day. 22M Last year March I started abusing alcohol with a wine bottle on most nights of the week. This year it got out of hand with 2 - 3 wine bottles a night. Just over a month ago I had a heavy binge and woke up with an abnormal hangover. Just felt very ""off"" like a sense of derealization. Extreme brainfog and even more extreme anxiety. Thought it was a bad hangover, to my absolute horror the symptoms persisted into the next day, and the next. I came to reddit in a Great panic. The symptoms did feel to abate after 10 days, so I abused again for 3 days and felt the feelings return. I have since quit cold turkey (alcohol, weed and cigarettes) on the 5th of June. It's over a month later and my life feels different, I still have the symptoms and I'm worried I've ruined the rest of my life. Symptoms include: intense brain fog, derealization (I feel only 50% conscious) depression and anxiety, fatigue, malaise, tinnitus and headaches/pressures. There was a brief period around 9-12 June that I think I felt largely normal and happy but since then it's been pure hell. I am now 33 days sober.

1lucaue,"Just need to vent, seeking advice, but I think I know the answer","Hi folks,

I've been on and off again with my journey, and I hope I am finally on the home straight. I'm down to 2-3 light (2.2%) beers a night, and I can see a time this month when I don't drink every day, and soon after that, nothing unless for special occasions, or maybe forever. One day at a time at this stage. My goal is zero beers after the end of July, when I'm taking a week off to get my head straight. I don't want a cloudy head whilst I work on other issues. However, my wife, let's call her T, is spiralling out of control and concerning, and I honestly don't know what to do. 

I've convinced her that she needs to do something. Finally, she agreed, and she went to the doctor and got a referral to inpatient detox. But in the last few days, she's been secretly drinking and drinking for long hours, like close to 4 litres of wine in a night. One night, she secretly ordered a second 4L bag to come to the house whilst I was asleep, and asked my daughter not to tell me. I'm glad my daughter ignored that and did tell me, and T confessed yesterday when I confronted her. 

We had made a pact that we would stop drinking at 9.30 pm even if we weren't finished, something I am sticking to. However, a couple of days ago, she drank from 2 pm until 7 am. Yesterday, she filled her tumbler glass to the brim at 9.30 pm and prevented me from taking the tumbler to the fridge or at least away from her. She drank until I fell asleep at 11.30 pm. I have no idea if she continued after that, but my guess is yes. I bet she has supplies hidden elsewhere so even if I took the bags away, she would either just get more or go find her stash.

This excessive drinking is triggering my daughter. I know T has an inpatient detox coming up. But it seems like she's on some world record attempt, and I feel like it's undermining my attempt at sobriety. 

Honestly, I don't know what to do. I'll get her to rehab when they have a spot open, which might be a month or two down the road, but it's straining on our relationship in the meantime. I know that no change can happen unless you're ready to give up and make a change. I worry that she'll do the detox and come back and start drinking again. 

I'm just seeking advice on how best to tiptoe around this nightmare. I don't want to draw any red lines until after detox, but I think I need to think of my daughter (F17, nearly 18) and myself if things don't improve. Thoughts welcome if you've been in this spot before.",1751938978.0,3,5,alcoholism,addiction

1ltv81g,Alcoholism and spouses,"Hi all, just 2 days sober here. Not really much to celebrate but I’ve realized I’ve dug myself into a deep hole. I used to drink in moderation, maybe 2 drinks twice a week. Then it turned into a beer/glass of wine or 2 each day. And then it spiraled into massive amounts of straight whiskey every single night with some day drinking on weekends.

My husband and I (both 35) do this together. He’s a little worse than I am as he’ll start binge drinking earlier than me, but we’re both in the same boat. We talk about it when we’re sober, how this isn’t healthy or sustainable, and the crazy frequent liquor store trips to buy handle after handle of whiskey are pretty eye opening yet it continues. We’ve both built such a high tolerance that we can easily drink a pint glass of whiskey in one sitting and feel very little. Maybe more, who knows. We never get blackout, we don’t spend the nights vomiting, it doesn’t impact our behavior noticeably, but the next morning (every morning) always sucks. Physically/mentally, it’s hit me pretty hard at a chronic level… swollen face, carry weight poorly despite being a healthy weight, low energy, anxiety, depression. This is already pretty hard for me and I felt quite sick last night. 

I know other couples have been in this boat. I love my husband to death and I worry about the what ifs. Severe alcoholism is absolutely rampant in both of our families, and we both grew up with alcoholic parents. Not sure how we fix this as I can’t control his drinking behavior, all I can do it talk to him. Any and all advice would be much appreciated.

My father relied on alcohol almost everyday of the week (6-7days every week). He would drink and drink till he lost control. There was a time where he would come home hours after work, already who knows how many beers down, pick me and my sister up and head out to brewery. He would drink till they closed or close enough to closing. He relied on the alcohol almost daily, like a crutch. Though there were time where he would stop for a month or two sometimes more because his health would decline. But after it was back in the okay range again he would start off with a beer or two and after 3 or 4 (depending on the % he was drinking) he would be doing almost everyday again... his behavior became so scary and unnerving that I would mentally prepare myself having to stay up all night, make sure he had a trashcan or pot next to his bed, walkway in his room completely cleared enough that he didn't trip and kill himself. He would be very emotional and talk about death (his specifically) and what my sister and I should do if that ever happened. This kept being an on and off thing till I was about 26. It started to finally slow down a couple years before. He let himself only get like that one in a while since. He was careful enough to not drink before work, but also so irresponsible that he drove in such a state destroying my grandmother's car, his car, and mine. All on different occasions. For clarification he simply took our keys and lied to my face multiple times on the matter. He doesn't drink no more than a beer or two occasionally/socially/ once ever few weeks... ive constantly called it being an binging alcoholic... and I now feel like that is the wrong term.

Please be kind. I’m 34 yo female, I live in a city with a ton of parties and clubs and entered that scene before I was 20. It was easy for me to get alcohol, when I was underage I drank that shit Four Loko and Joose, when I was 21 I started drinking a ton of liquor. I went out every day, I was making enough money to do it, and had drinks bought for me, Long Island and shots were my favorite,
The time I was around 26 I started drinking every single day.
I struggled since I was a teenager with eating disorders and I started gradually using alcohol to replace food. However, I was using beer (6.5-7.5%) and at first it was working but I started getting really bloated, my nails splitting and my hair falling out, I recognize this is a separate issue but am just trying to give context because it feels relevant.
About two months ago I started ordering these wine coolers because I read they had less calories than beer… but have a higher ABV. I never had hangovers before, had a few random rough days earlier this year, but now I throw up. Every single day. Multiple times. I try to have some water, it comes up. I wake up throwing up and spend the first half of my day throwing up. I actually feel totally fine otherwise, the nausea hits me out of nowhere and when it hits, it HITS. I need a bag or toilet immediately, even after a night of sleeping it off.
I know I have gastroparesis from malnutrition but I’m obviously not making any GI issues better. I consider myself to be in recovery from my ED but I can barely eat, I have hyperosmia and the smell of everything makes me sick. I seriously can’t stop throwing up and now my BMs are showing signs of fat malabsorption, it’s like I s*** olive oil into the toilet. I have demolished my stomach.
I talked to a doc and they recommended I, “taper off,” instead of going cold turkey based off my weight and the amount of alcohol I was consuming, as at the time I didn’t have health insurance and was at a severely low BMI so said I couldn’t do detox.
I have health insurance now and am thinking about checking in for inpatient/detox. Idk even know if they cover it but I’m running into the ground. I’m really worried because I am a functioning alcoholic, I got hired a few months ago for the highest-paying job I’ve ever had, and am concerned about my future with it. I’m worried about my cat.

1ltk1s8,Tired of this.,"So I've been sober twice now and it's like I get triggered by a traumatic event and feel like I need to drink but I can't drink like a normal person, it turns into benders. I was drinking everyday for a year and then was sober for a month, relapsed then went to a rehab and was sober for two months and now have relapsed again. It's been 3 weeks and I've drank everyday. It's like I'm scared I'm going to die if I stop??? But I've been fine the past two times I got sober. The anxiety is what's the hardest for me. I'm taking naltrexone so it helps but then I get into my head that if I don't have at least two shooters I'm going to die. I can't sleep bc I'm scared I'm not going to wake back up. I know it's all a mental game but it's hard. I keep trying to remind myself that I've done this before and had been fine so I'll be fine this time too. I'm also not drinking like how I was before I tried to get sober; I was drinking almost a 5th a day. I'll have 5 shooters throughout the day and realize it's less and less each time after I've been sober. Not making excuses by any means but def have noticed it's not as intense each time. What helped everyone? I'm scared to go to AA bc I don't want to get judged. I have a psychiatrist that I see every three months but I have PTSD and maybe need therapy? Did therapy help anyone?? Just looking for support and no judgement. I have great family and friend support. My two best friends have been sober for two years. One from alcohol and one from oxys. Please no judgment, it'll just make this anxiety worse..",1751859251.0,2,5,alcoholism,addiction

I really wanna do this but with how I feel I just wanna get drunk and forget 
I was also using Xanax everyday mixing the two for about 2 years straight but im now 8 months off Xanax but that caused my drinking to get worse

1ltc53t,Over 7 years alcohol free and I feel so alone.,"(M53) I've noticed that my old friends have their social lives and relationships largely revolving around alcohol, which led me to quietly distance myself. This wasn't difficult since their messages, calls, and invites dwindled pretty fast. These days, most interactions are just likes or hearts on social media, and honestly, those feel pretty empty.

I've tried to engage by joining men's church groups and attending AA; however, I haven't really connected with anyone deeply. My expectations aren't high, but I'm keeping an open mind—it just feels isolating. I feel like an outsider, and loneliness weighs heavily on me.

About four years ago, our church experienced a serious breach of trust and mishandled finances, which forced us to leave. This has made us wary of trusting churches again.

My wife (F40) has been sober for about a year and a half after a life-altering experience with alcohol. She’s not alcoholic. She shares my feelings of loneliness and worthlessness, grappling with anxiety, depression, trust issues, and anger. Her previous friend group betrayed her in a profound way, leaving her afraid to reach out again.

This past July 4th marked our fifth consecutive year of having no invitations. Weekends can be disheartening; we often feel left out.

Strangely, many people seem to genuinely like us. If I were to read this, I might assume I'm some kind of weirdo or geek.

The reality is that we’re pretty cool—we just choose not to drink. We have no issue with those who do responsibly, but it seems alcohol is a cornerstone of most friendships and gatherings.

Right now, I’m hurting deeply. It’s hard not to want to give up. I ache for both myself and my wife. I’m not even sure what I’m asking for; I just need to express this. We’re feeling incredibly sad and defeated.",1751836152.0,6,9,alcoholism,addiction

1ltm31z,Needing a little advice,"Hey there, I’m in need of some advice on if/how I should leave my boyfriend. I used to be an alcoholic I couldn’t go a day without a drink. I was never mean or angry but I quit about 5 years ago because I didn’t like the way I felt constantly. I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years now and when we first got together I told him I didn’t want to be with someone who drinks constantly. He told me he’d quit he doesn’t like being drunk and all that, yet 4 years later he’s still drinking constantly getting belligerent and continuously starting fights. He has financial control over me and is my only source of transportation. We have a 2 year old together, and I don’t want him growing up in a household like this. My question is what can I do to get myself and my children out of this? I have no friends or family where I currently live and my closest support system is almost 1,500 miles away.

1ltd9cz,Do I need help?,"Hello all,

Just throwing this out there because I’m interested on what some of your stories and experiences are and if maybe I’m on the verge of something a bit more worrisome than I’m currently allowing myself to believe.

I (38M) spent a large portion of my life, 17-30, getting written off every weekend. I’ve done a lot of work to peel that right back and can and have gone months without drinking without even realising it. My current issue is, life has found itself to be in a pretty good place lately so I’ve allowed myself to overindulge a little more than I like.

Maybe once every 6 weeks or so I’ll head out after work with workmates, and what was only ever planned to be one or two becomes a full blown write off, up until 2am with the whole weekend spent in bed recovering. I wake up and tell myself never again, I live a very easily controlled and driven life for the next 6 weeks, then it happens all over again and I’m left wondering why I’m like this.

Deep in my mind I can’t help but shake the feeling that control is a greater victory than abstinence, and I feel I’m constantly testing myself to go out, have a couple and return home like a regular person, which does happen from time to time. But more often than not I find myself going full throttle and questioning my life.

So - who here has lived experience with a similar relationship with alcohol and what did you enact to improve it? Am I best off just going completely straight or is there hope to one day control my drinking? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks",1751839028.0,2,7,alcoholism,addiction
1ltgwke,Interactions,"My main question I have is this -

When you are wanting to get with a (certain) woman but it feels like you when you are drinking .. you get along with them amazing, she will do anything for you, etc..
But when you are sober you feel as if .. (the girl has a lot of money and I dont) , as if I’m fighting a battle to be with her. 
I understand I probably have my own battles to face, but I also don’t want to have to drink to be around her to feel good. 
Is there a reason behind this? Any insight (and no, she’s not this first girl I have felt this way about)
Thank you for any insight 👍🏼",1751849331.0,0,0,alcoholism,addiction
1lswjr1,Being completely sober for a month and a half after being addicted to alcohol made me realise,"that a clear mind has plenty of time and space to be ten times more honest with you. Funny enough, I believe I started drinking specifically because I started being honest with myself.

I'm gonna keep this vague because I don't wanna get into details, I just don't feel like it, even with anonymity. I know what it's like to be toxic and hurtful. I've treated some people like shit. Friends. Relatives. Other people who wanted to help me,.even in their own fucked up way.

I was kind of self deluded and was making excuses for myself, manipulating my own self to not feel bad. That gradually stopped. One day at a time I began looking at a bad past event for what it truly was.

Long story short, I went through a phase of severe self loathing, guilt, depression, mild suicidal thoughts. I wasn't seeing any of my friends, I didn't think I deserved them. Lost touch with some of them. That's when our little devil came to my life. I started drinking alone some times every two weeks. Then every week.

At some point I told myself that I can't keep living like this, I need to make peace with myself. The idea of quitting drinking was in my head, but I prioritized not being negative, trying to be helpful, setting goals for myself. It took a lot of time but I was feeling much better. The image of some of my father figures being proud when they saw how much I had improved myself gave me even more courage.

My alcoholism had gotten worse, I was drinking about a bottle of whiskey almost every night before sleep about a week or two before I quit. Until I said fuck it, I'm doing so much better, alcohol is not helping you and you know it. The sleeping problems I used to have returned, and like I said in the beginning, when my mind was clear, guilt returned as well. It was always there somewhere in my head, but I guess alcohol was blurring it.

I don't hate myself anymore, and when my mind is busy I feel good. But in those moments when you just relax and try to enjoy yourself, the demons of the past come to haunt me. Some times even when I have some time at work, it distracts me. That wasn't happening when I was drinking.

I gotta say, I'm doing much better. I think I'm kind of happy, I'm taking good care of myself and have healthy relationships with people around me. I guess the true journey begins now, I always knew that it's a journey that never really ends. Maybe therapy will do some good. It's in my plans.",1751791582.0,16,0,alcoholism,addiction
1ltco6g,My boyfriend ( 20M ) and I ( 20F ) don’t know what to do to help my mother in law.,"Hi everyone,

First of all, I want to apologize for any mistakes, English is not my first language. I hope you can understand what I’m trying to express. We are in a very difficult situation and are looking for advice or guidance. Also, please let me know if i’m in the correct subreddit, it’s my first time using this.

My boyfriend and I believe that his mother (my mother in law, 46F) may be struggling with alcoholism. She refuses to see a psychologist or check herself into any mental health facility. She’s a very sweet and kind-hearted person, and she deeply loves her children (my boyfriend and his sister). But life has treated her very badly, and over the past few years, we’ve seen her slowly fall apart.

She separated from my boyfriend’s father about 5 years ago after being in a long and very traumatic relationship for over 20 years. Since then, she’s been drinking heavily. I don’t want to share too many details, but there have been really serious and painful situations in her life, partly due to the people she surrounds herself with, and partly due to alcohol. Things that have caused both emotional and physical harm.

Lately, she’s been drinking even more and has told both my boyfriend and his sister that she doesn’t want to live anymore. She says she tries and tries but just can’t keep going. She doesn’t have a stable job (for understandable reasons), but she sometimes does small cleaning jobs to get by.

We’ve tried to help. We’ve talked to her, tried to encourage her, brought her to a therapist, but she stopped going. Both my boyfriend and his sister have done everything they can to make her feel loved and needed in this world, but nothing seems to reach her.

I’m writing this because we’re lost. I’m extremely worried about her. She’s never been cruel or aggressive, always warm and gentle, but I’m also very worried about my boyfriend and his sister. The constant fear that something might happen to their mom is destroying them emotionally. The mental load is so heavy, and I don’t know what to do to help either her or them.

Does anyone have any advice or has gone through something similar?
Any kind of help would be appreciated. Thank you so much.

For the past few weeks every single night I’ve been having relapse dreams and it stresses me out to no end. I’m a bartender so I’m around it constantly. This is also a more stressful time in my personal life than I’ve had in a bit. I haven’t been concerned about relapsing since I quit until now, it just didn’t seem like it was on the table. Now I am very stressed about it and would really like to just go ahead and take it off the table for a few months. I’m just really worried I wouldn’t be able to eat plums. Like I’d be scared about them being too ripe. I can go without non 0.0 NAs, without tasting drinks at work, I cannot go without plums during plum season, I basically did a direct swap alcohol for plums when I quit last year",1751832375.0,1,4,alcoholism,addiction
