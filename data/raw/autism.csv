1lr4wlu,"Heat intolerance, icky sunscreen, and that sun is so bright! How to deal with summer","Hi! It is summer for a large portion (but not all) of our users. These temperatures are no joke! I've gone and gathered some information that may help :) Feel free to add anything I've left out in the comments!

# Sensory Friendly Sunscreens

There is no one size fits all because we have different sensory needs.

However, you may be more inclined to a certain type of sunscreen than another.

Gels

* ""For the face I can totally recommend ""**Clinique Superdefence 40**"". It's a gel, not a cream and feels like liquid on skin. It's cost is quite steep, so I use any other oil free sunscreen for my body.""
* ""I had the same issue, then i found **Neutrogena hydro boost sunscreen** (there's the ""everywhere"" version and the face version) and it changed everything. It absorbs very fast and doesnt feel gross. Its more like a light gel.""
* ""Been trying out ""**Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel**"" and like it so far.""

Sticks

* ""I use **Attitude brand** sunscreen if I have to. It comes in a tube like a glue stick, slightly nicer texture. I prefer SPF clothing though, no greasy oil just synthetic fabric.""
* ""I found a sunscreen made for babies that comes in a stick like deodorant specifically for your face. I think it’s **Aveeno Baby**. It works great without the greasy feel and doesn’t make my face break out. For the rest of my body, I use the spray kind and rub my hands on a towel after rubbing it in.""
* **Neutrogena Wet Skin Kids Stick**
* **Neutrogena Dry Touch Ultra Sheer Stick**
* **Aveeno Baby Face stick sunscreen**

Sprays

* ""**Nivea SPF50 protect and dry touch** is more tolerable than most""
* ""**Nivea SPF50 protect and dry touch** is decent and what I use""
* ""I use **Neutrogena Clear Body SPF 50 Sunscreen Spray**, it's not greasy like suncream or lotion and feels like putting very light oil on your skin.""
* ""I recently discovered **Blue Lizard mineral sunscreen spray** (I use the one for sensitive skin) and have been very happy with it, it goes on very dry.""
* **Babo Botanicals Sheer Zinc Spray**
* **Banana Boat Light as Air**
* ""While wearing **Black Girl Sunscreen’s Make It Glow SPF 30**, I barely noticed it on my skin. There was still a slight oily feeling to it even once dry if I directly touched it with my hand, but it was never so extreme that I felt I needed to wash my hands before touching other objects.""
* ""If you’re in the market for a non-sticky sunscreen, the **Babo Botanicals Sheer Zinc Sunscreen for Extra Sensitive Skin SPF 30** was one of my favorites to wear once I actually had it applied. It was entirely dry to the touch and left no residue at all when I brushed against it. It also left an odd matte texture on my skin that wasn’t horrible, but it was definitely a noticeable departure from how my skin normally looks.""

Lotions

* ""I use **neutrogena's ultra-sheer spf 70 dry touch sunscreen** and it doesn’t feel greasy/oily nor does it have a much of a smell. it smells a bit sunscreen-y when you first apply it, but it wears off within seconds""
* ""The look of the **Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch SPF 70'**s finish was one of the strongest from this list for those (like me) who are bothered by visual changes in skin texture. There were no noticeable matte or shiny qualities beyond what my skin normally looks like. It also wasn’t overly noticeable while wearing it, in a very pleasing way.""
* ""**Supergoop** is my preferred product. Not greasy or sticky. Not very oily either.""
* ""I use **Cetaphil daily moisturizer** with spf on my face. ""
* ""I really like the **Cerave sunscreen**, it feels kinda gross first applying but it dries really really quickly and then it doesn't feel all gross and greasy after it's dry like some others do. Hope this helps some :>""
* "" I use **Banana Boat Light As Air Sunscreen Lotion** for the rest of my body.""
* ""The other is **Banana Boat Sheer Sunscreen**. It’s still a lotion, but it isn’t too lotion-y. It’s very thin and doesn’t gunk all up between your fingers or on you. I use it for the beach and such.""
* **Neutrogena Dry Touch Ultra Sheer**
* **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen**
* **Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence**

Powders - primarily for the face

* **Brush on Block Translucent Mineral Powder Sunscreen**
* **Sunforgettable Total Protection Brush-On Shield**

# Coping strategies or distraction tactics to putting on sunscreen

""Sometimes I apply sunscreen with latex/vinyl **disposable gloves** on. Take off the gloves and snap, you're done and no gross hands.""

Providing proprioceptive input prior to sunscreen application can help to reduce touch sensitivity. This is the sensory input one receives from the movement and force of muscles and joints.

Some examples include

* massage/deep pressure to applicable areas
* any pushing/pulling movement
* use of weighted items
* digging in sand
* animal crawls
* wheelbarrow walks

Rub down arms, legs, and back with a towel before applying sunscreen.

# Sunscreen alternatives for when you really just can't handle it.

""I bought some (hi spf rated) **sunscreen shirts**, brand was **Willit** but similar ones out there, that have hoods, thumb holes to cover backs of hands, and even a full face pullover. Wear these & big sunshade hat instead of sunblock.""

""Like others, I use **UV clothing and hats** in direct sun""

""I do prefer just having long sleeved clothing and using an **uv protective umbrella or a hat** (pro tip, you might be able to find wide brimmed basic bucket hats with spf 50 rating from stores that sell fishing gear, i found mine from a store like that)""

**Coolibar Clothing** – Limit the amount of skin that is exposed directly to the sun using protective clothing. This brand offers sun protective clothing options in shirts, hats, bottoms, and swimwear.

# Sunburns

Generally the best treatment for a sunburn is **pure aloe gel.**

They make varieties that are lotion based but the best treatment is going to be pure aloe.

People often keep their aloe vera gel in the fridge so that application is cold.

If you are cold sensitive, you might want to keep yours out of the fridge.

# Heat and needing to be in long sleeves

If you need to remain in long sleeves during the summer, there are ways to make it more accessible and less dangerous.

Usually it is recommended to wear **cotton** or **linen.**

It is also recommended to wear **loose-fitting** shirts.

While some autistics may like cotton or linen loose-fitting shirts, some do not.

Another option is to wear an **athletic**, sweat-wicking, **tight-fitting shirt.**

A tight-fitting shirt will work better for those that don't like light touch and instead prefer pressure.

If you don't like these options and have a shirt you like to wear already, you can try **arm sleeves.**

Arm sleeves are separate from a shirt and can come on or off whenever needed.

When wearing long clothing in the summer heat, it is important to wear **light colors**.

Light colors will reflect the sunlight away from your skin, keeping you more cool than dark colors.

# How to stay cool with heat sensitivity.

Try to drink a lot of **water**. You need at least four cups of water. (Four cups of water is not very much. You need more than this, but I am sharing the minimum for those that struggle).

Not everyone can drink water. If you can, try to drink something hydrating instead like a sports drink or something with **electrolytes.**

Electrolytes taste salty. Some common electrolyte drinks are Gatorade, Powerade, Pedialyte, Liquid IV, coconut water, Lucozade Sport, and Body Armor.

I struggle with drinking liquids and am frequently dehydrated. Sometimes I like to chew on **ice cubes** because I like the crunching feeling. This helps me get water.

I also like **popsicles**. Eating a popsicle is another way to get liquids.

You can also get water through some **foods,** like watermelon or cucumber.

If you go outside, make sure you have water with you, and take **frequent breaks.**

If you have a lot of trouble understanding when you are overheating, have someone with you that can tell you. It is important to cool down when you are overheating.

There are many ideas to staying cool when overheating. Some of these are:

* **Cooling towels**. You wet it, ring the extra water out, and lay it on the back of your neck. You can also use a cold rag or cold hand towel.
* **Portable fan**. These come in a lot of varieties. Some you can put around your neck (Portable neck fan) and some you just hold or set on your desk.
* **Cooling vest.** This is good for those that have sensitivities to wind on their skin. The cooling vest is made of ice packs.
* **Gel cap**. These are usually meant for migraines, but when you are hot, cooling your head down can cool the rest of your body down. They go on your head and cover your eyes. You can also stick them in the fridge to get extra cold.
* **Ice packs**. Ice packs can keep your drinks cold. They can also be used to cool your body down by placing them inside a ziploc bag, then wrapping a hand towel around the bag and placing it on your chest, neck, or forehead.
* **Drink or eat something cold**. If you can't get regular liquids into your body, try ice cream or sherbet.
* **Cold foot bath**. When you are hot, it's important to cool your head and feet down. If you can tolerate the change in temperature, sticking your feet in an ice bath, or just a cold water bath can help.
* **Cold bath.** If you can manage getting your entire body into water, a cold bath or shower can be a great way to cool down quickly. Just be careful to not shock your body from the change in temperature.

If you are at home, there are some ways to keep the home cool:

* **Block the sunlight**. If your home doesn't have air conditioning, block out the windows with a light colored or reflective panel.
* **Fans**. If you are sensory sensitive to wind, tilt your fans towards the ceiling slightly, so they don't blow directly on you. If you have a ceiling fan, you may need to find a long sleeve shirt to wear that isn't too hot.
* **Avoid using the oven or stove.** The oven and stove give off a lot of heat. Try to limit to just the microwave or air fryer if it is possible.
* **Turn your lights off.** Lights can let off a lot of heat, so try to avoid lights when you can.
* **Give your devices a break**. Devices like phones and tablets also overheat. Avoid using them in direct sunlight and while they are charging.

1mpzwfi,How do we feel about eggs?,"Ever since I was little, fried eggs have been my staple. I learned how to cook them before I could think straight and some days thats all I had for every meal. They are easy, trustworthy, predictable, and one of my favourite foods. I see some people cook it, and it is goopy, borderline raw. Some people like yolk. If my eggs are gooey at all, I will gag and possibly vomit. I used to cook them until they were crispy around the edges- which is still good, but over time Ive come to tolerate them well done. As long as the yolk and egg is completely firm and “dry”. (Although, I use enough butter that it is far from dry.)

1mqjoz3,"I hate dating 'rules' why does everything have to be playful, light, and gradual?","I hate it. I hate that you’re supposed to ""build rapport"" like some cringy corporate team-building exercise. I hate that depth and vulnerability early on are seen as ""too much,"" while stupid witty banter and ""fun flirting"" are the golden tickets.  

I don’t scare off when someone’s honest and direct, I highly respect it. I don’t care for the chase, the manufactured “mystery”, or the dance of small talk. And when I try to tone myself down to match the ""normal"" pace? It feels very wrong (and even boring at times). Like I’m wearing a mask and pretending to be someone I’m not.  

Maybe it’s because my philosophy on trust is backwards in comparison to most people: I give it unconditionally from the beginning. I don’t need to ""warm up."" If someone betrays it, that’s on them, not a reason to preemptively distrust the next person. Most see being taken advantage of as a failure or evidence of why trust is earned; I see it as a tax paid for the freedom to live without suspicion. Time spent withholding trust is just time wasted in half-connection.  

But apparently, that’s ""too intense."" So do I keep faking it and resent the process, or stay unapologetically me and accept that most won’t get it?

1mqn37g,Afraid to seem racist at work due to my facial blindness.,"I recently started working at this job with a diversity of people. Lovely people. I have been trying really hard to learn names and get to know peoples faces. 

There is this one middle eastern guy at work called Allah.  I had to ask many times to repeat his name to me just to avoid saying the wrong ""super-racist"" name if I referred to him wrong. Like imagine calling someone Allah when they are actually called Bob or something idk. Worst fear imaginable. 

And then after a while of calling him by his name I notice what seemed to be his twin brother working at the same shift that day. I was questioning my sanity when he seemed to teleport from one spot to another when I realized. I panicked inside, afraid I had called his brother by that same name. I asked a trusted coworker if he had a twin. They were not twins, just brothers. I could barely differentiate them, same build, facial structure, hairstyle as well as a matching uniform. After looking closer I notice the brother had facial hair, I only assumed the guy had fast hair growth and was shaving regularly. Having no clue they were different people. 

This happened when I mixed up the names of the asian guys on my team as well. I felt ashamed. I started to take notes of peoples name and would practice them at home just to do it right. 

I hardly recognize people when they get a haircut or trim their beards. This doesn't apply to only people of different ethnicity, I struggle with all people. I just feel more self conscious about this one.

1mqn5lg,Interesting Conversation About Autism From A Retired Therapist,"Folks:

I had a fascinating conversation with a retired therapist during a social event for LGBTQ people. 

The person is a retired psychology therapist who counseled with autistic people as thos with other disorders.

He knew about my own autism as I had told him last  year.

The interesting conversation started with me mentioning that I have a desire to wear clear plastic clothing (over underclothing, so not naked).

I had explained to him that my desire to wear clear plastic was due to my En Caul birth (situation when I was born, the unbilical sac did not break, which is a phenominon happening to one in about 20,000 to 30,000. 

What he said shocked me and suggests that myself desiring wrapping myself in clear plastic cloting could be due to my autism.

He claims that sometimes autistics may have a tendancy to want to wrap themselves tightly as if to protect themselves.

This threw me off the rail. I had never heard of this. In fact, when I asked this group if there was connection with my autism and my desire for wearing clear plastic cloting and the answer was no, at that time.

While I love wearing transparent raincoats over my colorful clothing, I am otherwise a high functioning autistic (retired electronics engineer)

To me, the theory of the En Caul birth contributing to my desires seems to make more sense.

Have amy of you heard of a possible result of autism is the desire to wrap themselves tightly in fabric or plastic?

I get so overwhelmed. I just started a new job and have only had 8 1/2 hours in, only 2 1/2 into actually working so far, and I’m contemplating quitting. My heart rate skyrockets to 180 when I even THINK about having to work. I came home today and have been unable to move or do anything but sob my eyes out because of how overwhelmed I am long after working. The last job I had only lasted a month, and I quit for the same reason. I literally can’t even trick my mind into making work bearable. Saying “Other people in the world don’t even have the opportunity to work.” doesn’t even work for me.

Im almost an adult and genuinely don’t know how I’m supposed to survive in the real world. I can handle school fine, but employment might be the death of me. Yes, I have a “dream job”, but it’s more like a dream field of study. I can’t even begin to comprehend how people work more than 3 hour shifts, and every time I try to explain how badly I get overwhelmed, I’m immediately invalidated. People say, “It’s the easiest job in the world.” but it’s impossible for me. Is anyone else like this? I’ve looked into stuff to help with the overwhelming feeling, but literally nothing works for me.

1mqk4ow,"Gatekeeping Therapist, Wrong to Feel Angry?","Long story short, I was recently and properly diagnosed with ASD 1. This post is about a therapy session I had BEFORE being diagnosed, in fact it was probably what propelled me to seek out a concrete diagnosis this late in life. 

I always knew I was on the spectrum even before I was diagnosed. Things had increasingly felt harder to manage (life, relationships) so last year I sought out a spectrum friendly online therapist. Not even one minute into our initial session she says everyone comes to her to affirm their suspicions of autism and they get mad when she shuts them down and tells them it's something else, ""just fair warning,"" she says. I was immediately put off, I hadn't come to her for a diagnosis, but she didn't even hear my story yet before launching into that ""warning."" I began to tell my story and she goes ""yeah that's trauma, not autism."" This pattern repeats for nearly the entire session. 

I felt like she was so insistent on gatekeeping spectrum disorders (she had several autism tattoos on her arms) that she quickly dismissed any notion that I could be on the spectrum. I was livid, I felt dismissed, disregarded, and unheard. I immediately began seeking ways to obtain a proper diagnosis. I searched for weeks before finding a place that took my insurance. I went through the process with a licensed psychologist and eventually received an official diagnosis: ASD level 1.

I want to schedule an appointment with the original gatekeeper to thank her for helping me get to the point where I got a diagnosis, then also to go f off. Valid? Overreacting?Anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. ",1755222535.0,4,9,autism,autism

Happiness that I finally understand, confused about what comes next and anger about how all the signs were missed. The thing is that I showed very “stereotypical” signs of autism in my childhood I just think its so wild that these signs were missed. I used to have such bad meltdowns that I would lay on the floor screaming. I once had one in class so bad (first or second grade) that I climbed on the table and screamed until two adults had to carry me out of the classroom. I didn’t speak at all until I was three then I started talking so excessively and loudly my family nicknamed me “radio”. I hated touch so much from anyone. I was so sensitive my mom nicknamed me “sensitivity” and my sister used to call me “queen”. I used to line up my toy hamsters and just stare at them. Of course I lived in an arabic country where these were seen as behavioural issues and I had to learn to mask pretty early but even when I moved to europe I used to sit at the front of the class at the lone table (where kids would get sat at for punishment) because I didn’t want to socialise. I had a meltdown in the middle of class where I threw my bag across the entire classroom. But I had good grades so I guess that was all neurotypical behaviour apparently. And now my parents don’t even believe the diagnosis. It just makes me so angry. This is obviously the gender bias in autism diagnosis. It doesn’t matter if you showed the textbook signs, if you are a girl it’s almost impossible to get diagnosed as a child.

1mq8huy,Why do autistic adults sometimes not support their own communities?,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share some context and ask an honest question.

I’ve been in autistic/neurodivergent spaces for almost a decade, and I work for an autistic-led org that builds programs *specifically* for autistic adults. We’re not a day program, we’re not “teaching” people to mask, and we’re not trying to change anyone. We focus on inclusion, neuroaffirming spaces, and letting people just be themselves, online and in person.

We’re even **peer-led-** meaning autistic and neurodivergent adults lead the groups and shape the spaces themselves. We hire, train, and support autistic staff so that programs are truly by-and-for the community. We've worked with many neurodivergent and autistic professionals such as Dr. Temple Gradin, therapists, and organizations to create these spaces.

But here’s what’s been breaking my heart lately: I’ve seen autistic folks tear down other autistic folks. Sometimes just because they can’t relate or don’t want the same kind of connection. Sometimes it’s aimed at our autistic staff, people who are dealing with the *exact* same world and struggles as everyone else in the group. And the comments can be so nasty they push staff into burnout, and sometimes even out of the job entirely.. Or we'll receive a hurtful feedback that it's ""still"" neurotypical for something over like conversations starters/icebreakers, like how else are autistic people supposed to communicate and engage with their communities?

I’m neurotypical, so I’m used to criticism (“you’ll never understand” / “us vs. them”), but watching autistic people direct that same hostility at *other* autistic people… it’s rough. Our autistic staff are dealing with the same world and the same barriers. As a manager, it's hard to see our staff hurt just as people, not even the autism piece. We are humans first.

So here’s my genuine question:  
Why do you think some autistic adults don’t (or can’t) support their own communities—whether that’s donating, paying small program fees, or showing up consistently?

We often hear there’s “nothing for autistic adults,” but when we offer programs and ask for even a small fee or donation (to cover costs and keep things running), there’s pushback. Sometimes we lose money hosting events because attendance is so low or the adults don't want to pay even $5 dollar charge. We've hosted free events too, still no one shows. We've asked for feedback multiple times, but at the end of the day, we lost grants because of no attendance after building out these spaces.

What barriers or feelings do you think are behind this? I’m genuinely trying to understand, because we can’t keep building these spaces if our own community won’t show up for them.",1755195239.0,10,45,autism,autism

Italy: 5,5


Unfortunately here there is no full awareness of Autism or special services of welfare for people having it (you can get recognized disabled but there are no checks like PIP in UK for example). However people have heard about it but basically don't know recognizing symptoms or common traits among people with this disability.
My experience in center and south Italy has been a disaster, but the north is okay: local people were nice and quiet (unlike southern one, especially women),  and humbly respectful.
And the doctors there are very competent and know their own job.


Tunisia: 4

There is no awareness, not only about autism but about mental health and disabilities as well. People have heard about it and they think it's caused by vaccine.
People there were loud and quite disrespectful.


France: NR




Ireland: 6

Similarly to my experience in Northern Italy local people were quiet and politely respectful and there is awareness, however the doctors were incompetent but this doesn't change the factual awareness and the positive experience there.

Because of two massive burnouts (over multiple years), I'm no longer able to work. I've had to move back in with my parents while I try to get disability. It has been almost 2.5 years back here, and I'm like 3 years into the disability process. 

I'm in a holding pattern. I won't find out about this round of disability until probably next month. I'm not doing well. Just kind of trying to make it through each day to the next. It's so fucking hard being here. Honestly it was a major source of abuse. My mother, as much as she seems to want to understand, DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SHIT! She tries to give me solutions to my shutdowns when my brain is not capable. Just do it doesn't work. 

I went from low-support needs to mid-support needs. I struggle with everything. Currently, my sister's dog is visiting for the week. That means she has to sleep in my bed. It means she wakes me up early. It means she's glued to my side most of the day. I love her, but there's a reason I don't have a dog. I can't deal with the neediness/sensory issues.

1mqmef3,Is it possible to change the very way you process information and the world around you?,"Hi Reddit, I (28tF) am autistic, and find myself frequently frustrated by the confines of how my mind operates, and just need answers, advice, discussions... some form of feedback.  This post is very long, but please spare the time if you can.

The things that are my greatest strengths, my analytical nature and my focus on precise meaning of things, are also my greatest limitations.  On one hand I'm extraordinarily good at problem solving and feel very confident in my ability to use my words to convey meaning, but on the other hand I overthink literally everything because I can't seem to turn off the analysis engine, so to speak, and I severely struggle to comprehend that which is not literal, obvious, or explicitly communicated.  While these things are very classical autistic traits, I can't help but feel robotic at times, attempting to participate in discussion but falling just short of passing a Turing test.  

I feel often times like my life is somewhat on rails, and that I don't have the ability to experience as much of life as others around me because, for better and for worse, my tendency to overthink things means that I am neither impulsive nor spontaneous, nor comfortable being so.  When it comes to art, my very literal interpretations of things means that most symbolism, short of well established genre trends I'm already aware of, ends up lost on me, and I struggle to find interest and meaning in the abstract or the heavily symbolic.  I am aware these things have value to others, and often those others are friends who are near and dear to me, but often just cannot appreciate it for myself because my interface with the world is inherently at-face-value.

I do my best to understand people who aren't much like me and the things they make, because I recognize their value and love the diversity of human experience, but I also just wish that, for a moment, I could see the world how others see it.  It seems fun.  It's often beautiful, honestly, from my point of view.  I feel confined by my own nature, and robbed of the ability to experience the world in a more, well, human way.  Even my other autistic friends are nothing like this, and are instead very laid back, go with the flow, feelings over reason types of people.  I understand that there's nothing inherently wrong, per se, with being like this, but I can't help but admire and covet the whimsy and wonder with which others interpret the world.  

I wish I could make spontaneous decisions to go do things, that I could enjoy the thrills of life moment by moment, that I could be IN the moment most of the time.  Yes, I know that the other end, being excessively impulsive or thrill-seeking, isn't great, and that being overly focused on the subtext and non-literal meanings of things can put your head thoroughly into the clouds.  What I'm saying is that Horseshoe theory applies here, that these are two extremes and I wish I could find my way toward the middle, but no matter how many different people I meet, no matter how many deep discussions about world views I have, reaching the middle just seems impossible for me.

So again I just have to ask, is it possible to change the way in which one naturally processes and interprets the world around them?  Or is the way our minds interpret information an immutable part of who we are?

1mqbff5,Nice way to say “stop talking to me”,"I have just gotten home, after about 5 hours out. Im tired, agitated, and have no energy or will to speak. As soon as I get home, my grandmother is unintentionally in my space and asking me aggravating questions. I do not like being frustrated at her, and she did nothing wrong, so I want to tell her I am not up to talking. Shes pretty abrasive and unfamiliar with my autism.

What is a good thing to say, thats inoffensive and polite? Im not good at phrasing things. Ive been told I sound mean, and am extremely blunt. While I don’t mean harm by that, it definitely does harm, and I have no idea how a neurotypical person would say it.

My teenager with ASD has been complaining recently that he doesn't understand the ""point"" of romance/love/etc., and he would like to understand it better. He is NOT at this time interested in a romantic relationship for himself, but he has identified it as a part of the world he doesn't understand very well and he'd like to understand better. (I think partly because his uncle is getting married in a couple months and we're all excited for it.)

He is a big reader and loves to read, especially steampunk and scifi (but it doesn't have to be steampunk or scifi!). Can you recommend some novels to help a 16-year-old boy understand the ""point"" of romance and why other people might be interested in it? Something that would let him understand the emotional aspects involved?

Of course I have my favorite romances in literature but a) I'm his mom; b) I'm neurotypical; and c) he thinks my taste is boring and way too heavily influenced by Jane Austen (fair point).

So, getting an autism assesment can be extremely expensive, but, a few years ago (2023 ish), I used to visit a psychologist, and I always mentioned knowing I'm autistic but wanting proof of it, that psychologist said that while getting an actual diagnosis really is expensive, we could do some sort of general test, to see if I truly was autistic.

  
They had me building legos, they game me a box for a lego house, and talked to me while I played it with, the box clearly had instructions for how to build that house, but I was having fun so I played around and made like a garden thingie, clearly going off instructions, anyway, after the test they said I probably am not autistic. and to this day I'm wondering, tf kinda test was that?? did the legos have any part in it? should i have built it like the instructions?

I feel like the giant screaming question mark from Gravity Falls right now. I’m questiony the question mark and everyone’s ignoring me… which I’m kinda used to, but still.

TikTok updated their rules. They basically say:
	•	Don’t sexualize minors
	•	Label realistic AI so people know it’s fake
	•	Don’t harass people
	•	Don’t do challenges that could kill you

That’s it. And yet, people are acting like this is some massive political dog whistle.

From my autistic perspective, it’s baffling. Cause → effect is simple: rules exist → break them → consequence happens. If you don’t want the rules enforced on you, don’t break them.

It’s like yelling “FIRE” in a library for fun, getting kicked out, and then insisting the librarian is part of a secret authoritarian plot.

I have only just gotten my diagnosis but have been told for about 8 or 9 years since I left the military that I show heavily autistic traits and finally got tested.

1mqlaa5,(vent/open discussion) feeling like I have to protect my skin 24/7,"I just really want to talk about this because its something that bothers me so much. For reference, I am currently waitlisted for ASD and I will leave it at that. 

I am super sensitive with the kind of clothes I wear and what parts of my body they are covering. It feels like it is entirely seperated from any kind of social condition and just feels inherent to my personal experiences. I have to wear something really long sleeved or wrist warmers (different patterns are always fun!) to cover my wrists. I am very sensitive about anything touching my wrists especially if I am typing or drawing. the classic cockroach hands were also something that I did a lot normally but also as I sleep. I feel like I have to protect them and I even get super grossed out when i see them, to the point its almost phobic. I also wear socks 24/7 specifically knee socks and thigh highs. My shins have to be covered or else I feel extremely vulnerable and I hate feeling things touch them. In the rare occasion I wear crew socks (NEVER ankle socks I hate them so much!!! they make me cry) I have to make sure they completely cover my ankles and I am wearing a long skirt that also reaches my ankles. And as for the back of my neck, I hate having anything touch it but I love having it covered, which is really contradicting and can sometimes be overwhelming. I feel really exhausted about all of the things that mess me up; I feel like I am shielding or guarding my body like a really sensitive knight. I sometimes just dont know how I am going to cope with it as I get older.  i just feel like a kid sometimes even though I am now an adult I still cry and get squirmy over anyone or something touching me. I feel like I am a little freak sometimes but maaaannn i know i just gotta accept it but damn!!! squirming in front of coworkers/patrons because my wrists accidently hit the edge of the desk doesnt help me look anymore normal (I try to keep masking to a minimum at work). I also feel like I am all alone in this and ""weird"" for it. I used to tell a doctor about it and how im carpophobic and he would do a ""trick"" of making me close my eyes and touch a part of his hand only for it to be his wrist.

1mql1n2,Vent,"Hi, so for context I have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression. I haven't been diagnosed or assessed for autism but it's something I've thought about alot and have gone back and forth on. But I think there's a strong chance I have it. (For clarification, I am not asking if I am or not, I just wanted to give context for my vent)

So today I went to a ""concert"" type thing, but it was a sit down type of concert, with chairs scattered around. When we got there it was quite full, and there were only a few chairs empty, but it was unclear if they were being saved for someone else or not. That caused me a lot of anxiety because I have trouble talking to strangers at all, and I didn't want to bother people. My parents were there and they suggested that we go sit at a less busy spot, where we could listen but not see. 

This stressed me out a lot, more than the chairs did. Because I had got it in my head that I was going to see a concert, and watch people preform. And I was excited. And now that we weren't watching, I was bummed out but also very very stressed out by the change. But I didn't say anything, despite really wanting to. I believe this is when my verbal shutdown started. (I am not sure what the proper term for this is, but I have learned that ""going nonverbal"" is incorrect and harmful. Please let me know if there is a better term I should use instead)

We sat somewhere less busy, but it turned out that we couldn't actually hear the music at all. I was fidgeting with my water bottle and bouncing my leg, staring at nothing and attempting not to cry or show emotion about it cause it felt like a stupid thing to get upset over. My parents got drinks and we sat there in silence for like 10-15 minutes, and I was still unable to say anything unprompted. Although, strangely I am able to speak if I am spoken to or asked a question when this happens, and I don't know why. 

Eventually my mom suggested going back to see if we could find a spot, and I started walking back without saying anything to them. At this point I was feeling a weird mixture of numb and upset. I no longer had the energy to make facial expressions or react to things much. 

I walked back and there were still no obviously unused seats. I anxiously walked around for about 10 minutes, then just stood and watched instead of sitting. I eventually found a chair off to the side in a pile of broken chairs, but it wasn't broken. So I took it and sat down, despite it being full of spiderwebs. I did not care at that point. I had also brought over the ear headphones that are semi-noise cancelling, which helped a lot because for some reason concerts are unreasonably, obnoxiously and unnecessarily loud. 

I say and watched with a blank face for a while, and at intermission my mom found a seat and sat beside me. My dad left, and we waited. At some point, maybe five minutes into the intermission I realized I wanted to leave. I didn't enjoy the music very much anyway, and was in what I think was a shutdown, still having trouble speaking unprompted and it felt like I was stuck in the chair like I couldn't move? But I was unable to say anything at all for around 20 minutes, and just sat there, again trying to not cry. Eventually I was able to casually tell my mom, ""this is taking longer than I thought"". I was trying to hint to her that I wanted to go, because saying it outright was impossible. She said something open ended and said to tell her what I want to do. Which was just great (sarcastic), because I physically couldn't. 

So I sat there miserable for another ten, fifteen minutes before I was able to say, ""can we go?"" She didn't understand what I said and asked what I wanted, and I said, ""go?"" And we did, and somehow I masked the entire situation well enough that she didn't ask questions

I am 30 now and the last year I’ve only just been learning more about autism in therapy and on my own. My therapist guided me into accepting I am autistic despite me fighting that my whole life.

I spent my teenage years and early adult years convincing myself I wasn’t autistic. I grew up being screamed at for not wanting to wear jeans, screamed at for not being able to tie my shoes or had issues with buttons. I was made ashamed of my autism and was never taught about it. I did get some support like OT and speech growing up. As an adult who owns a house, provides for myself, works full time, and does everything myself, I am struggling. I get so overwhelmed and will cry and hyperventilate. I deal with cptsd as well, so that plays a part. 

I keep up with work & cleaning, but by that time I get overwhelmed with phone calls, errands, additional housing things, and putting away laundry. I struggle to get myself to social events. 

It’s hard to always be scripting what I need to say in relationships and at work. I do WFH which helps a lot. I love my job, but when I have meetings it takes a lot, scripting, dealing with anxiety, questioning everything I say, and wondering when to speak etc. 

It’s just me, I don’t have parents and I have one close friend and my boyfriend and a sister that lives a bit away. I am in therapy twice a week right now. CBT(always)and DBT(short term).

I've told him repeatedly that birthdays mean a lot to me and are the only day of the year I get to feel special. He acknowledges this but still doesn't do anything about it.

I'm looking for some advise.

My sister (35) has autism and it's been really helpful to her and our family to have the diagnosis as we all much better understand things like her feeling over-sensitised / needing space at loud family get togethers. 

However I'm a little worried that some  behaviours are not being challenged due to her diagnosis, and I feel concerned we're doing a disservice to her. But as someone who doesn't have an ASD diagnosis, I don't feel qualified to draw a line between what's accomodation and what's enabling.

The most prominent example is that she fell out with one of my brothers - they are now no contact (which I don't have a problem with, sometimes that's just the way relationships go).  However because my cousin is very close with this brother, she has stopped talking to her too. And I don't mean going low contact or no contact...as in, literally she pretends she isn't there / my cousin will say 'hello Sarah' and she literally stares straight ahead and doesn't respond.

I very much understand that ideas of loyalty are very strong to her, and that she struggles with flexible thinking. But the rest of the family pretend it isn't happening/ no-one challenges it (because they feel this is making accomodation for her autism). But as I say, I am concerned that we are enabling behaviour that should be challenged. They don't need to be best chums by any means, but is it asking too much for her to be civil to my cousin on the occasions they're around each other?

The Jellomilk comes out slightly different depending on whether (and how long) you whisk it, and how cold the milk is. Room temperature milk and no whisking makes the two layers much neater, with less froth.


Alternatively I'll sometimes put the Jello and hot water in a blender, and add same volume of a fruit or veggie. So far I tried appples, carrots, peaches, and the greatest revelation, cucumbers... which was shockingly good, much against my expectations.  Mixing and matching the Jello flavor with the added ingredient is half the fun, really.

1mqhc4e,Is anyone else an extroverted autistic?,"I sometimes feel like an outsider around other autistic people because I don’t know a lot of autistic people who are extroverted. At the same time, though, I don’t feel like I’m as extroverted as a neurotypical extrovert would be, since many of them tend to perceive me as being withdrawn and closed off. Socializing with them is equally awkward because they think I’m cold when I’m actually just nervous as all fuck.

I’m not, I just have social anxiety. To me at least that’s a lot different than being an introvert because I want to talk to people and make friends, but I’m afraid of bothering them so I normally sit on the sidelines and wish somebody would talk to me first! Sadly, that usually doesn’t work.

I haven’t met many other autistic extroverts. A lot of neurodivergent people I know don’t seem too interested in that sort of thing. Please understand that I’m not trying to criticize them for that, as a matter of fact, I envy them. I think it would be easier if I just was happy in isolation.

Making friends or dating seems impossible. People usually don’t talk to me. I don’t even think it’s that people necessarily dislike me. I haven’t really noticed people avoiding me, it’s more like I’m invisible to them. They just don’t seem to even notice that I’m there most of the time. I don’t want to risk talking to other people first because I don’t want to unintentionally make anybody uncomfortable.

1mq51yi,How do you find friends?,"Hello. 

I get straight to the point. I always had a hard time actually connecting with people on a deeper level. Over the last few years I at least learned to somehow get people in school to like me, so right now (I'm in 12th grade right now) I have a fairly easy time in school, as most of my mates really seem to like me. But the thing is that in order for them to like me, I have to play a role. The role of an overconfident class clown with no sense of shame. But that's not who I am, and I notice that it's slowly bleeding me dry. It's a role I simply play to survive in school. A role meant to fall apart the moment a wrong nerve gets struck inside of me. It has no meaning beyond that. There is no depth to this role. It's a surface-level representation of what society wants me to be. And it's pissing me off. There are so many days where I just find myself crying right after I leave school because I hate playing this role. But it's a necessity to easily get through school. 


However, and here's the main problem: it also does not allow me to build up any meaningful relationship with anyone I know. My mates really like me a lot, but I didn't even bother to get their phone numbers. Because I'm afraid that I might not be able to stay in role when I'm texting with them in private. Because I'm an insecure weirdo. And usually I'm okay with that, but there are moments where I just feel incredibly lonely. There are so many things I want to say. There are so many things I have to say, and yet nobody will ever hear those words. Nobody I care for will ever know what things I like and what I'm passionate about, and it really hurts. I'm not overly social to begin with, but I also can't stand being alone when I feel like I have something to say. No matter if it's simple things or more emotional stuff. No one will ever hear those things, and it hurts like nothing else. I know it's selfish what I'm asking for, but I just want a person that I can open myself up to. 


And before someone says that I just have to open up to my mates and that everything will get better from there. No. It won't. I've tried it very carefully multiple times, and I always faced social rejection when I tried to show who I really am in school. It's something I need to hide, and it's slowly picking me apart. Because I really have no one at all I can be myself with. No one will ever know who I am. And it hurts, but I don't know what to do about it. Sometimes it just feels like there's no place for autism in society. Everyone mostly likes the same things, and the moment you like something a bit more specific or act differently, you will already get into social conflicts. And I hate it. I just want to have people who think similarly to me or have similar interests, but it's so incredibly hard to find. And so I'm asking for help here.

i guess i can look for clinical trials too but id like to see if anyone else at all has tried it. his book was published almost 10 years ago but i can’t find a single story.

at the end of the day i don’t want to fail interviews with my dream company because i couldn’t read tone and blurted out a stupid question about the salary when in reality the salary was amazing lol. or a job opportunity to live in japan (!!!?) because again, i asked a question that i logically thought fit, but didn’t actually fit the subtleties of the tone and context only a NT can detect.

i know there’s a sentiment that we are perfect just the way we are and have absolutely no good reason to treat symptoms that ruin our lives and that the *entire world* should just change and “accommodate” us instead.

but like… that clearly hasn’t happened before i’ve lost so many *dreams* like this, just to not reading or giving the appropriate social cues. just to the black and white thinking. just to being naive and not getting things.

i didn’t realize how much of it was a problem until a therapist suggested autism. but now i see it. and it’s sad. there’s so much of life i’ve been missing. just bc i can’t read social things. there’s so much more i want from my life that’s been blocked by low social status, inflexible thinking and special interests eclipsing what’s really important.",1755214336.0,0,2,autism,autism
1mqgqxt,25f. How do I know if I have a crush on someone?,"I don't feel things the way most people do. I don't feel things as intensely, although that may be a lie as I do have depression. All of this time, I've thought that I was both asexual and aromantic until I got a girlfriend and realized that I may actually not be aromantic. But I still can't tell because again, I don't feel things the way most people do.

I've never felt butterflies in my stomach, I've never had sweaty palms or been nervous in regards to talking to someone with equal power (aka not job interviewers, etc.). I've never felt *any* of the symptoms that come with a ""crush"". Not even with my ex girlfriend. But I did want to be with her all the time, was very clingy, liked flirting with her, etc. Things even got sexual between us even though I wasn't attracted to her. 

But now, idk if I have a crush on someone. I've had a couple of dreams about kissing her, but that was never the main focus of it. I've wanted to kiss her *once* when we were hanging out together. And being *with* her doesn't make me feel disgusted, but again, I don't feel nervous, butterflies, etc. 

This is not ideal as she's my best friend and both asexual and aromantic as well. I confessed to her like 10 years ago that I may have a crush on her, but I couldn't tell the difference between a crush and just friendship feelings, I just wanted to be with her all the time. I told her all of that. She said she didn't feel the same way and I was like okay :p. And I felt it too. Didn't feel rejected or anything. Just indifferent. 

If I were to confess to her right now, I would still feel indifferent when she says she doesn't feel the same way. 

But even when my girlfriend and I broke up, I felt indifferent, just upset that we wouldn't talk every day anymore. 

Do y'all think this is a crush? Or just me wanting to explore and have that closeness again?? 

I should also mention that I have only been in 1 relationship in my life.

Also, I find girls absolutely fucking beautiful and do want a girlfriend. I also want to marry a girl someday. Guys are pretty too, but they scare me. The only reason I would ever be with a man would be to dominate him in bed. But that's it. Never as a boyfriend. I am still not sexually attracted to either though.

Not just pleasant, but as if you've stumbled into some hidden layer of reality where everything feels cinematic and significant? I experience this with:  

Hyper-Specific Magical Settings:

Hotels are my ultimate sensory wonderland:
- The click of the keycard door unlocking  
- The hum of the AC unit
- The muffled orchestra of sounds: ice machine crunching, elevator dings, laughter through walls as people pass
- The smells: chlorine, linen, stale lobby coffee, plastic-wrapped soap bars  
- Tactile stuff: crisp sheets with just-right thread count, the weighted comfort of stacked pillows  
- Visual magic: curtains that dim the world perfectly, infrared light from vending machines
- Tiny rituals: unwrapping the cups, using the tiny shampoo bottles, watching the digital alarm clock blink  

Other examples:
- Parking lots after rain: Rainbow oil slicks, echoing footsteps, the buzzing halo of floodlights  
- 24-hour diners: Vinyl booth squeaks, coffee cup clinks, being a silent observer of the night shift world  

Cinematic Moments:

Weather as a sensory playground:
- Rain: Petrichor , the sound on different surfaces, clothing slowly becoming heavy  
- Snow: That sound of snow underfoot, how headlights make snowflakes look like falling stars, listening to the blues why wandering.

Others:
- Dancing wildly in grocery store aisles even as people look at me weird
- dancing in an empty parking garage
- Swinging on playgrounds at midnight

Cinematic human moments:
- The feeling of accidental eye contact with someone across the room (it can either feel like an intense thriller or some sort of rom com, but either way it’s electric)
- Eating takeout alone at night

I don't just notice these things, I vibrate with them. It's like:  
- My brain highlights sensory details in neon  
- certain spaces feel like safe, controlled stimulation  
- Scripted-feeling moments provide predictable joy  
- There's beauty in the ""wrong"" places others ignore

Its been especially bad lately, all ive been craving for months is only liquids like juice and smoothies and milkshakes, with the exception of expensive restaurant food. I currently have only drank water and an energy drink today and had one little slice of pizza because thats all I could force down my hatch.

1mqegjs,I resent my autistic best friend,"I've known her since highschool, I didn't like her at the time at all because I felt she was annoying (I didn't know about her diagnosis back then), I remember not liking her but not really the reasons why, if I even had any actual reasons at all.

Well things changed and both our situations got pretty bad, we both started smoking weed and drinking all day every day, experimenting with harder drugs too, so obviously we bonded over that and started hanging out all the time. During those years, I don't remember having any significant negative feelings towards her, we were always having fun.

We're both 20yo now and both got sober this year (yay us!), in my personal life I'm thriving for the first time in years, I'm genuinely so happy and content it feels strange. BUT, for some reason my best friend has started annoying me in the same way she did when we were younger, it's just much more personal now that we are already so close.

The biggest thing is her not listening to me, never asking questions, never remembering things about my life or the things I talk to her about. Our conversations are basically her telling really long stories about her life or interests, I always ask questions, listen, actually try and be there for her and try to care about stuff she has to say even if its something I know nothing about. Tbf most of the time I actually do care, and I do generally really like listening to people, but god damn does it feel awful after talking about her things for hours on end, finally saying something that only I care about, and she totally shuts off.

I can see she's not interested, it's not even that I need the absolute same level of listening, with active questions, reactions etc that I do, were all different after all. It's just, I can so clearly tell that she doesn't give a shit about things that don't have something to do with her life/interest. I get that it's hard for some autistic people, but also I feel like I have the right to be annoyed with that.

I've recently told her this, along with other things, but absolutely, totally 0 changes has happened since, she was really apologetic, explained her autism to me and how it effects her social skills etc, and I want to be the person who can sympathize and grow around her limitations, but I already feel stretched to my limit. I do feel like I already know a lot about autism and how it can effect someone's life, I have ADHD and was also tested for autism at the time of my dignosis, my mom is autistic, actually she and my friend have a lot in common haha. Anyway, understanding something doesn't mean I don't still get hurt by her actions. I want something back and I'm starting to realise it's probably not possible. I need different form of communication all together.

My ideal relationship is all about silent cues, actions, reactions etc, I feel like talking is kinda unnecessary if we can read each other well enough. For me being straightforward is hard, I just feel rude and not like myself, also I often accidentally lie when talking or things just don't come across like I imagined in my head. But that's mostly fine IF my body language, expressions etc are being taken into account. Maybe this is why I've always gravitated towards animals, with them it's just body language, I find it amazing. No need to try to string together a complicated sentence if I can see what you mean from your eyes.

My friend is the total opposite in this.

Anyway wtf do I do? I'm beginning to doubt if I really like her as a person, or did I just want a friend to drink, smoke and do crazy things with, and now that that's over, there's nothing really left.
She is fun, she really is, but is that all friendship is? I crave for a genuine connection and try so fucking hard to find that between us, but I'm actually reaching my limit.

I have learned, very slowly and painfully over many years, that I have terrible reactions to certain things:

Propylene Glycol (PG): often found in scented candles, flavored coffee/whiskey/tobacco, perfumes.  It's a *very* common food additive and most people have no issues.  I, however, have the strangest reaction.  It gives me migraines, makes my skin itch, feels like I'm about to sweat, and makes my neck and back hurt and hands and feet feel weird.  It's like I'm being microwaved and very itchy.

Artificial Sweeteners: I don't know what it is, but all of them from Aspartame to Sucralose give me a taste that lingers for hours, headaches(no migraines), very flushed, dizzy, and brain foggy.

It's difficult because finding household scents, protein powders, flavored liquor, etc is all a minefield, and it has taken me almost 2 decades to narrow down that this is a problem.  I also come off like a weird snob because I can't drink the ""caramel hazelnut"" coffee. I can't chew *any* gum from the store, it all has aspartame in it, and every time I convince myself it's not real and go for it, it happens.  I can't find much good documentation on it.

My first encounter was when I was a kid, the gym I was in would light citronella candles and they gave me a full-on migraine(which I thought was a headache when I was kid, so I just tanked it), and most recently I have been trying to use a protein powder to keep my macros up while cutting calories and it's just sucralose but it makes my face feel like I have a sunburn and gives me a headache.

The speech bubbles on the outside are the hurtful and wrong reactions of people in regard to my diagnosis. The inside speech bubbles are the mean things I have been told in regard of my autistic way of being, but from people not knowing I was autistic (I didn’t know either at the moment of these happening. Worsening my self esteem). It felt all my life like I was a monster, an alien, an outsider, the only one without the script, without the knowledge of how to act right. All my life I’ve felt afraid to be me because even when I tried really hard it always seemed to be wrong. I suffered so bad from all of this. But when I received the diagnostic I felt the peace to know it wasn’t my fault. I am not impolite or rude or mean, I just don’t know that things are considered this way by others. The black lightnings on my body are the manifestations of my pain because of everything I had to go through. The light in my stomach is who I am. A beautiful, shining person. And this light is being contaminated by all the bad things I’ve been told, forcing me to dim it to not make waves around me. Because when I’m me, undiagnosed, I just appear as a mean neurotypical. If only I knew sooner. If only I could take all that pain from little me who thought for decades that she wasn’t enough as much as she was too much. I despise the system for not teaching about autism. I despise the health system for not taking into account women. I despise every person who wasn’t able to see my pain and only treated me like a broken useless toy, still expecting me to perform and act as “normal” people do. I especially despise my former psy of 6 years who told me “you are not autistic.” based on nothing, knowing full well she isn’t specialised in autism. And because of her and others, even though I knew in my heart, I put it to the side and had to wait even more years without a diagnosis. I had to go by myself to a professional, I had to pay all 2800$ by myself. And I despise her because when I came back to her with a diagnostic she told me laughing she thought I wasn’t autistic. I left her. But it broke something inside of me and I feel like I have to prove that I am autistic and handicapped.

1mqckf3,Embarrassed for crying,"Hi all, I've looked through other people's post and realized that I am a HSP and on top of that, I am on the spectrum. This post may be long so I'll post a tl;dr below. (I already posted this in HSP so that's why this paragraph may be a little off) 

Ever since I was a little kid I cried ALOT and even over the smallest things. I was also a very shy kid, so shy that my parents had to tell me to be social whenever we went somewhere that involved extended family or just regular family in general. Anways back to when I cried all the time, I cried whenever I got upset or got frustrated which is normal but I would even cry when I got praised. I hated praise it would embarrass me so much, I also cried when embarrassed or yelled at. My parents didn't know why I cried a lot and eventually I got tested for autism and sure enough I was autistic.

This brings us to what happened yesterday. So I play Trumpet and I'm a senior in HS. There was a senior who graduated a couple of months ago that almost the whole band looked up to including me. Him and his girlfriend (P and A) were viewed (and still is) the best players in the band. Anyways I am best friend with the both of them and they are pretty much the coolest people I have ever met. P plays almost every instrument and A is the best trumpeter in my band and probably the school. Mind you they don't know I have autism or at least I think they don't.

I get lessons from A because I know he'll make me a better player and I'm pretty sure he's the reason where I got to today! Well yesterday I had a lesson and I was having trouble figuring out a rythmn and I thought he was getting frustrated and mad at me because I'm a senior and I know should typically know more. Anyways I start to cry (mind you this isn't the first time I cried at one of the lessons), so he stopped what we were doing and comforted me. He told me that it was fine and he knew that I could do it. He also said that we're learning and it's okay to mess up and I instantly felt better. It was like was comforting a baby with a toy or candy but instead this was just encouraging words,  which is why I'm a little embarrassed.

I guess I get more stressed around him because he is someone I really really look up to and don't want to embarrass myself around him, which I guess I'm not really good at but oh well. He was super nice about it and knew exactly what to do probably because it's happened before. After all that, we moved on with the lesson and everything was fine. I figured out the rythmn and he was super proud of me. I just hope that he doesn't think I'm a crybaby and that I cry for manipulation (because I've seen people in this sub say that to others and it worries me that people think I'm one of those). I genuinely cry because I'm stressed or embarrassed. I even texted him saying thank you for helping me and sorry for crying. He read it but didn't answer so I hope that doesn't mean anything. 

 So I posted this to wonder if I should be embarrassed or not and also want to know how to not cry as much in front of him. I really want to keep doing lessons with him because he is the best and he's sweet. I just hope he still wants to do them with me after it being a 3rd time I cried during a lesson. Any advice? 


tl;dr I had a trumlet lesson yesterday with one of the people I really looked up to. I cried out of embarrassment and now I'm worried he thinks I'm too emotional. Any advice?",1755204048.0,1,1,autism,autism

For context, I'm in my late twenties and I started a university course when I was 18. I struggled with the commitment **hard** and dropped out in the first year in January. I think my issue here was staying living at home and having to commute to uni so I was already overstimulated before I got to a lecture. 

I also started a different university level course 4 years ago and again, I really struggled and left that course halfway. 

  
I'm recently diagnosed so I'm quite new to figuring myself out, what it means, how I can help myself and what support there is for me. 4 years ago I never even considered autism was the reason for my struggles in life.



I've found a degree that I really want to do but I'm worried I'm going to start and then leave again. I want to get a degree to open my options up for a career, as right now I can't get into anything I *want* to do. My motivation is to get into a career I really love which ultimately is going to make my life a lot easier and feel less like a slog (I hope). The burn out just comes out on top every time though, no matter my motivation or how hard I try, it always wins and I want to try change that. 

  
I guess the point of this is: 

Do you have any guidance on studying and having autism? 

How do you push through the burn out to get stuff done?

If you have a degree, how did you manage and do you have any tips on sticking it out?

Every time she dumps stuff for me to do, I get mad and sigh because I have to do it, and whenever I do, she says the whole ""respect your mother"" shit, even though I sigh every time, and makes me feel some guilt.

Just a few hours ago without any warning she asks me to go get one of her car's headlight bulb changed.

1mqgutv,From an autistic special interest perspective: telling Taylor Swift to ‘step aside’ makes zero sense,"‼️THIS POST IS GOING TO BE RAMBLY AND MAY NOT MAKE SENSE‼️

I’m autistic and I’ve never understood the “Taylor Swift should step aside for other women” thing. Why is she the only female artist expected to stop working so others can “have their moment”? Nobody says this about Drake, Ed Sheeran, or literally any man in the industry. Morgan Wallen released 70+ songs this year (and he’s a known racist) and no one cared, but Taylor announces a 12-song album and suddenly she’s “hogging the spotlight”?

For me, Taylor isn’t just an artist she’s my special interest. She’s who I listen to when I’m in autistic burnout, when I’m overstimulated, or when I’m having a full-on breakdown. She’s basically where I get half my life advice. I’ve been listening to her since I was 6, and I’m almost 25 now. She’s gotten me through some of my toughest moments and been there for the happiest ones. That’s what being a Swiftie is to me it’s not about “chart domination” or “blocking other artists,” it’s about loving someone’s work so much that it becomes part of your life story.

I’ve probably spent hundreds of hours curating my Taylor Swift playlist so it’s perfect for every possible mood (autism hyperfocus go brr). So yes Taylor is my top artist almost continuously and probably will be as long as she keeps making bangers. Fans like me will happily drop a pretty penny on her merch not because she demands it, but because that’s the type of energy she puts out into the world, so it’s the type she gets back. (Yes, there are some unhinged Swifties out there, but we ignore them.) And that’s not Taylor “hogging,” some imaginary spotlight that’s what happens when someone builds genuine trust and connection over years.

And the women people claim she’s “overshadowing” (Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter) literally admire her and in Sabrina’s case… opens for her. Taylor’s not taking anything away from anyone she’s just working, and her fans (like me) are excited to support her. As soon as she dropped the “Life of a Showgirl” cover, I changed all my widgets to reflect her different eras and made my home screen Showgirl. That’s not “blocking someone’s shine” that’s just fandom, and nobody tells male artists to stop when they have the same thing.

If Taylor Swift making music makes you feel threatened for your fave, maybe you need to look inward — or maybe they do.

1mqakit,"Any of you guys got any tips at all on how to carry myself more ""normally"" in an way, however subtle it might be?","The way I carry myself is awkward, off-putting and at times even inconvenient. I'm trying to practise more conventional ways of posturing myself - for example: I've always instinctively written with the pen wedged between my pointer finger and my middle finger for some reason, and I've recently taught myself to adjust to holding the pen in the conventional way which has actually made writing feel a lot more comfortable for me in the end.

A more posture-centric example is that I've conditioned myself to slightly clasp my hands while standing and walking so that they lay in a more ""relaxed"" position. I've felt a noticeable increase in my confidence after pushing myself to do these things the way most other people do them.

Basically, I just want to know if there's anything else along these lines I could be overlooking that I could also adapt to. I feel like someone might chime in by saying to just be myself and not conform to societal pressure or something, but it makes me happier with myself to change the way I present myself in these ways.

1mpots7,Am I a bad autistic for not caring deeply about ‘community’,"I keep seeing TikToks and posts saying “community is being lost” or “the price you pay for community is being inconvenienced.”

I’m autistic (high-functioning) and I do the basic human decency stuff, hold doors, smile, help my close friends and family. But beyond that? I genuinely do not care about “interacting with my community” in the vague, cinematic way people keep describing.

Part of it is probably because I live in a constant state of burnout maybe from autism, maybe from life, maybe from the general absurdity of existence. Either way, we love apathy and nihilism in this household.

And here’s the thing  I used to have that “always show up for people” mindset. I’m a total people pleaser, and it took me almost 17 years to finally cut off a lifelong “best friend” who did nothing but use me. I always showed up for them, they never showed up for me. That whole experience made me generally not trust new friendships, so now I’m down to two friends and my family… and honestly, I’m fine with that.

Despite all this, I’m not some anti-social troll under a bridge. I have an on-campus job this semester. I constantly go to dorm events. I ask questions in class. I engage plenty. Everyone’s interpretation of “community” is different — but if your only example is “drive strangers to the airport,” then yeah, I’m not interested.

I just don’t think it’s fair to anthropomorphize a concept like “community” and guilt-trip people into caring about it without any actual research to back it up.

1mqdk8h,Urgently Seeking Florida Resources for Autistic Teen with Severe Aggression,"Hi everyone,

I’m writing because my sister is in Florida, and her situation with her 16 year old son has reached a point where I’m deeply worried for her safety and his future. I know this is long, but I want to share the full picture so anyone reading can understand the complexity and offer the most relevant advice or resources.

My nephew was originally diagnosed with oppositional defiance disorder before later being diagnosed with autism at age seven. He’s extremely bright and high-functioning in some ways, like he can hold long, detailed conversations and does well academically but he struggles socially and hates leaving the house. Crowds make him anxious, and since COVID he’s developed extreme germaphobia, taking multiple showers a day and always showering immediately after being outside.

He’s been homeschooled through a state virtual program since he was about eight or nine. He doesn’t have any friends other than a cousin, and his world has become very small. This isolation hasn’t made him calmer. Over the past five years, his anger has become more intense. He’s been hospitalized multiple times for violent outbursts. Each time he’s put on medication, but they’re always stopped within seven or eight months because his parents don’t like how it changes him. Without medication, the aggression comes back.

Most of that aggression is aimed squarely at my sister. He’s thrown chairs at her, punched holes in the walls, given her multiple black eyes, and more recently almost broke her nose. He dictates what she eats, what she watches, and even forces her to watch what he wants on TV, physically moving her face toward the screen if she looks away. She hides all the kn!ves in the house because he’s come at her with one before and the one time he destroyed multiple paintings by cutting them up. He has never physically attacked my brother-in-law, only my sister.

My sister’s life before this wasn’t easy. She grew up between my mom, grandmother, and her biological father, all of which came with different forms of neglect or abuse. At 16, she met her now-husband who was 25 at the time through church. They married when she turned 18. Her first pregnancy ended in stillbirth, and two years later she had my nephew. Over the years I’ve had a rocky relationship with her husband. I’ve seen how much he enables my nephew and babies him to the point that I think it makes the problem worse.

A recent visit to my parents’ house in Florida drove home how bad things have gotten. My nephew didn’t want to come because my parents have dogs that are pee pad trained, and while we clean, it still bothers him. He spent most of the visit shut away in a bedroom sulking that he was here. My sister ended up leaving early because she saw his mood changing and didn’t want to risk an episode in my parents’ home. She’s constantly making decisions based on keeping the peace, living in fear of triggering him.

I’m four states away and feel helpless. A part of me wishes she’d send him to live with me because I wouldn’t enable his behavior, but I’m scared of him too. I’ve suggested a group home, but they’re expensive and my brother-in-law is completely against it. But I truly believe he needs that level of care before something tragic happens. I’m terrified I’m going to get a phone call one day telling me my sister has been killed, my nephew has killed himself, or something else unthinkable.

What I’m Looking For  
Florida-specific resources for:  
Affordable or state-funded group homes/residential programs for autistic teens with severe aggression  
Crisis intervention teams experienced with autism and violent outbursts  
Caregiver support programs, including respite care  
Legal or protective options so my sister can remain safe while still ensuring my nephew gets care

If anyone has navigated something similar, or knows of agencies/programs that specialize in these cases, I would be deeply grateful for your guidance.

TLDR**:** My 16-year-old autistic nephew in Florida has extreme germaphobia, social anxiety, and violent outbursts, all directed at my sister. She lives in fear every day. He’s been hospitalized several times, medications are always stopped, and group home care is needed but cost and family resistance are barriers. I’m desperate for Florida-specific resources for residential care, crisis intervention, and caregiver safety support before something tragic happens.",1755206240.0,0,6,autism,autism

1mptat7,"Not to be dramatic, but do you sometimes feel like you have a decent day ruined by just going outside or leaving the house?","I know this is a mix of both agoraphobia/anxiety stuff and autism, but what I'm talking about right now is mostly the parts that are autism-related. Because admittedly sometimes it can be caused by actual mental anxiety type stuff, but even without that I struggle a ton

I can be having an ok day, like today, where I feel like I'm just... thinking, existing, ok, while I'm in the house. I may not feel great or having an amazing day, but it's like things just aren't quite so hard. Just existing, having a slow day. 

And then I go outside, and suddenly having to process the bigger world around me, trying to hold onto my ability to think and trying to make my brain work and not get so overwhelmed that I'm just in excruciating pain, makes me feel like I was just zapped into a new world. My brain can't filter things, I can't quiet my mind, or I feel myself mentally taking a nosedive, I'm panicking trying to make sense of things and feel calm and ground myself at all. I truly wish I could actually put it into words.

When I was a younger I spent my time constantly trying to figure out how to bring my mind down to earth and quiet my mind. And I don't just mean too many thoughts, I mean like, I feel like an astronaut in space, or like the world around me is a vacuum trying to suck my brain and senses in all directions and making it impossible to feel anywhere near grounded and think. Just existing as a person in a body, with a brain that can work and think in linear lines and just everything, was really hard for me to try to make happen at all and took so much effort. I would be a young kid and go to the store with my mom or out somewhere else, and suddenly feel absolutely horrible and feel these things I couldn't quite name then - I know now that what it was, was feeling suddenly s***cidal because of how painful it was, internally melting down, and sudden surges of extremely strong self-loathing (because of the instant extreme self-consciousness), to put names to some of it. *So* much of my time and mental effort in my life has been focused on how to work on dampening this down and trying to make it less painful.

This is part of why sometimes, even though I was late diagnosed and everything and would've sworn I was ""high functioning,"" I feel like in a way I can't relate to a lot of the most high functioning autistic people and almost wonder if I'd be either at the more ""severe"" end of level 1 or maybe I've even always been wrong and would be level 2 or something (if I were evaluated by a more thorough up-to-date psych than the one I went to who just gave me a basic diagnosis), for lack of better way to put it. Because it feels like I have these issues with I guess sensory things, proprioception, concept of time, mental processing issues, *something* I can't put my finger on, that are just worse than some of the high functioning autistic people I've known. Like it doesn't seem like their brain literally explodes so easily, like they don't lose the literal ability to think so often.

I don't know. Anyway, I guess I'm just flabbergasted by the way that I can sometimes spend a day in the house, sometimes get my brain calmed down to where I can just *think* and exist, and then *boom* it all goes away so quickly the second I walk out the door, or am faced with a sudden unexpected social interaction, or just so many things. But especially the way that even just simply walking out in my own yard can trigger this, and has been that way to at least some level for as long as I remember, will never make sense to me. Because I can so simply put it into words - ""oh, I'm autistic and have sensory/processing issues and agoraphobia,"" but *nothing* can truly explain the intense, painful, frustrating experience of going through it, and not being able to fix it.

1mpx0xx,I'm having nightmares about losing my friends,"I am very oblivious and overthink a lot about social signs because either I can't read them at all or if someone points it out then I analyze it so much it becomes exhausting. Help. I don't know what to do with this situation no more:

This is way too long of a story, so to summarize it, I had a band with my closest friends and one of them, a girl, decided to leave and leave our little circle because she said we were ”too weird” for her. Then she proceeded to start being very very rude to me in ways my other two friends noticed. A week later she admitted to treating me badly because she was jealous of me. Which threw me off balance. And she continued. So I had a breakdown and told the whole bigger group (about 12 people who talked badly about eachother, and me) to go fuck themselves and left. 

After doing that, I also discovered that most of them were secretly ripping on my disabilities, including autism, adhd, dyscalculia. The girl came to try and ”apologize“ to me but for some reason she brought them into the question and proceeded to be invasive about it and tell me I'm faking being socially dumb because I want people to think I'm innocent and also faking failing school due to untreated disability because I'm lazy. 

Recently I have been just ignoring her but my two other friends still constantly talk to her infront of me and this is stressing me out. She is throwing a birthday party and she invited all 12 people and my two friends to go except me, and my friends are going, and she only decided this after I threw a quiet birthday party and the others got upset they weren't invited. 

This is weighing very heavily on me specially because I feel like my friends aren't really on my side and this girl is randomly trying to pick a social fight I can't win with me. Today I had a nightmare where my friends quite literally just stopped talking with me altogether. I fucking hate humanity and people and I should get inside a car drive very far away and never talk to anyone again and leave these people thinking I was killed.

She is also very rigid and anxious. We try to accommodate her, but it is becoming clear that the world is not built for her. She is in daycare and comes home very upset. She has several meltdowns a day and sometimes her hands shake. She complains of headaches, which I suspect is anxiety. She screams when we talk.

We try to give her a consistent routine and lots of time to transition, but we both work so we can't keep her home.

1mpemtz,"How I Deal with ""Why Are You So Quiet?"" [Might be helpful for you too]","Like some of you here, growing up, I've heard this question a lot by family members, teachers, classmates and it always annoyed me, even more so when I was simply minding my own business.  
I would then feel frustrated for not knowing how to respond which would ironically make me avoid talking to the person who asked that question.  
I only know I've had social anxiety and have been neurodivergent in some form (either from trauma or by being born with autism) which no person in my life ever fully empathized with.

Now I figured there are two motives for that question (the first one being more common unfortunately):

**1) If the person is rude / narcissistic / bullying / provoking / projecting / passive-aggressive, they will usually ask that question out of nowhere to put you on the spot.**

Example: One of my aunts is known for talking endlessly and making everything about herself. I remember some family gatherings where my dad and his siblings would talk about random topics and then suddenly, my aunt asks my dad ""Hey, why is he \[referring to me\] so quiet?""  
She then keeps talking about how her son (my cousin) is much more active and social compared to me (even though he also tends to keep quiet during our family gatherings). She intentionally raised her voice so that I could hear it from afar as well. My dad couldn't give a better answer other than ""He's just like that"".

**I realized that asking that kind of question creates a power imbalance. To restore that balance, it's best not to answer directly but asking the person back on a meta level. This shows you can read the other person's tone and won't take their bs.**

**Examples:**  
**-Why do you ask?**  
**-Do you actually care or are you just provoking me?**  
**-Do you want to discuss something specific with me?**  
**-What do you mean by that?**

See how you're now **putting the focus on the other person**.

A direct answer would have kept the focus on you.  
My literal answer would have been ""I'm not always quiet. I just don't know what to say right now. I also don't feel comfortable enough. I can't relate because you're all older than me. Etc.""  
Replying authentically like this wouldn't have helped here, it most likely would make you appear naive which subjects you even more to being mocked.  
Even if the other person left you alone after your answer, the power imbalance would still exist and leave you feeling frustrated while the other person would simply move on with their life or even worse, start mocking your quietness behind your back in front of other people.

I've seen some others' comments saying they would directly mirror the passive-aggressiveness by replying with ""Why are you so loud?"" or they wouldn't even respond and just shrug or stare at the person.  
The problem here is this will most likely not work with someone who is an authority figure (boss, teacher, family member). A Karen type of person might turn the tables and accuse you for being the rude and disrespectful one instead.  
That's why I prefer **staying on a meta level, this allows you to stay calm and stand up for yourself without having to stoop down on their level of pettiness**.

Someone also commented they would repeatedly insist asking back ""What do you mean by that?"", ""No, no, I'm curious. Please explain!"". This is also a good method to catch someone off-guard, although I would reserve this method for moments when the other person aggressively throws hard insults at you.

**2) If the person genuinely cared, they would do at least one of these two things:**

\-They would **talk to you one on one** and instead of asking, they would **acknowledge you** and maybe offer help:  
Example: ""Hey, I noticed you're so quiet. Anything wrong? You can talk to me.""

You can also be assured they genuinely care when they know you're usually more talkative with them so context matters as well.  
Example: ""You've been so quiet ***today***! Are you okay?""

Only in this case, I would feel comfortable enough to answer directly.

\-They wouldn't even address your quietness (anymore) and simply **engage you in a** **different conversation**.",1755114602.0,34,7,autism,autism

1mot287,My autism isn't “dumbness” or “retardation” and I'm tired of my family acting like it is.,"
Today the family went out to a pizzeria and there was the adult table and the young table (for some reason). It was one of this long tables with a long stuffed sit stocked to the wall and on the other side normal chairs. I of course went to the stuffed sit and went to the corner to make room for the rest obviously. I know my cousins consider me “the weird one” but I never thought it would get to the point to not sit in obvious spots just to avoid me. It’s ridiculous!!! 
At one point, one of my aunts notice this and orders them to come sit near me, and the faces they make were basically of disgust. 

It’s little things like this why I hate being autistic. Because adults (my parents included) somehow think autism = dumbness or retardation. So they always tell me I’m misinterpreting things, or that I don’t understand my cousins, or that I’m not viewing their perspective, or that I’m exaggerating things. And even if they believed me, my cousins would never admit it, let alone change. It’s like being racist.

1mq102i,Am I ungrateful or am I abused?,"First, here’s my family dynamic. I (13M), my half-sister (6F) and my brother (also 13M) live with our mum (48F) and our stepdad (50M). I have autism, and I’m not sure which type (the doctor never said, either that or I cannot remember since the diagnosis was 4 years ago) but all I know is it’s the ‘smart’ kind of autism that doesn’t really make you act too neurodiverse, unless you get triggered.

Now, into the part that I need to talk about urgently before my brain pops.

I despise my stepdad. And it’s because of my half-sister. She is spoiled rotten, even for a 6yo. When she screams and cries, my stepdad immediately senses what is happening at the very second he’s in, then makes a punishment if applicable and doesn’t take it back or allow appeal. So yeah, he’s shallow. The punishment is never to my half-sister, which can lead to unfairness.

If I get unfairly punished, I try to appeal, get sent to my room (with all devices taken away, including non-electronic devices so I can’t even read) and then I get triggered and have a meltdown. Then I get even more punished for having a meltdown. ‘Oh you need to calm down mister or you’ll be punished even longer’- SHUT THE FUCK UP, JON.

If personality were to be described in pools, my stepdad is a stagnant puddle. He’s heavily biased as well. Also, he doesn’t seem to care about my needs. Yes, the needs are low (thankfully) but ignoring them can still lead to me having a meltdown if left unaccounted for too long.

Jon is a massive extrovert. And he also forces me to be one, despite the fact that I hate being forced to be someone I’m not. I can mask feelings, but not personality. He drags me to the park (which was renovated a while back so it’s all kiddy playstuff made of plastic and butterfly genitals or some shit) and forces me to chat to people I don’t know while expecting me to be friendly and talkative, and if I’m not, BOOM. More punishment.

I’ve lost the lines between if I’m abused or if I’m just an ungrateful bastard who needs to get my shit together. Sure, he tries to make me experience things (as parents should do), but he just assumes that I’m entirely okay with everything and anything he makes me do.

I can’t talk to Jon about this unless I want my phone and computer (bought with my own pocket money) confiscated alongside my books and any other things I have, I can’t talk to Mum about it because she’s stressed about work and I don’t want to be a burden to her, I can’t talk to my brother or half-sister about it because they’re not mature enough, I can’t talk to my dad about it because he lives in a separate home, alone, without contact to Mum or Jon so he couldn’t do anything about the situation. So I’m just taking a blind leap of faith and venting to fellow neurodivergents I’ve never met.

1mpttk7,Is it bad that im upset that i dont get an IEP?,"for context im 14, female and have adhd, autism level 1, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia and dyspraxia. im in year ten/freshman year at high school and i was being denied an IEP 'cause my attendance was too low last year (fair, they cant help me if im at school and my attendance was under 50% i wasnt sick i just didnt wanna go to school tbh and soemtimes id have anxiety attacks in the car if i was late to school and stuff) 

but now after my mum talked to my school they say i dont need one? their reasoning is that my teachers all give me acomodations anyways and that my mum makes sure they do but like, i just feel like its kinda messed up? i dunno maybe i missunderstand what an IEP (individual education plan) is but still. i had an IEP in primary school tho my teacher wrote one without consulting me or my mum which aparently was quite messed up of him.

anyways back to the matter at hand, i think i should have an iep but my school thinks i dont cus my teachers just do what i need anyways. my acomodations are a time out card that i can give my teacher to get ten minutes maximum out of class if i need a break (its kinda a life saver tho i havnt had it for long and havnt used it yet i do need it its jsut been a bunch of half days or i forgot i had it and didnt use it), earmuffs if its too loud, being allowed non-disruptive fidgets, writing  on my laptop rather than on paper (because i am at a huge disadvantage if i have to write on paper) and i dont do PE (my dyspraxia is so bad that i have to attend 1:1 swimming lessons for disabled children and go to a program thingy outside of school that is essencially so improve my gross and fine motor skills, i havnt gone yet cus we just learned it was an option but yeah. you get the idea right? no way can i join in sports with the rest of my class if my motor skills are that bad, ive tried i really have but PE is everything im bad at in one subject and i just cant) 

so anyways, my school and mum say i dont need an IEP 'cause everyone jsut follows my acomodations anyways and i dont understand, 'cause an IEP legally protects these so my mum and i dont have to fight my teachers if they ignore it (at the start of the year i had a teacher who would ignore my special needs and treat me like everyone else and it was so bad i had an anxiety attack in his class and whent to the office cus i felt like id cry or throw up or both, he didnt even do anything, it was just that he scared me and it genuinely is that hard a thing for me to write a bunch on paper) but for some reason they dont think they need to make it official just 'cause everything seems okay right now? im disabled enough that my mum gets money from the government, the government agrees im disabled (Tho you get benefits even if your kid just has asthma or dyslexia, cus its extra expenses, its a great system imo) 

but like i dunno, i guess id just feel safer if my acomodations WHICH I NEED TO LEARN where legally protected? am i overreacting? do i misunderstand something? what do you guys think? i just think its kinda dumb that i dont get an IEP tbh.",1755156523.0,3,7,autism,autism

I was talking to a ex friend, and the topic of autism came up. She was talking about how her brother has autism, and I said, “Oh, I have autism, too.” And here’s what she said: “You know you don’t have autism. That is very ableist of you. You do not have autism. I know how autism is, and you don’t have autism.”
Mind you, I have  low support autism. This got me really pissed because, of all the people who should know that autism is a freaking spectrum, it’s probably someone whose close relative is on THE SPECTRUM, right? so I told her, and she got very mad at me and continued calling me an ableist.

What really got to me was the fact that she herself was the one being the ableist—because she was belittling my autism, saying that I don’t have it because I’m “normal.” It was total bullshit to me. Needless to say, the friendship was over after that.

So the question is: 

for people who have low support autism? Is this kind of ignorance common?

1mpyz59,How to deal with moving out,"Hello, I’m NB 19 and I’m soon moving out form my room to a new apartment for university, and as before I knew it’s going to happen eventually, now while cleaning my room for the last time I can’t get myself together.

I hate changes, but moving to university was mostly an exciting idea for me, I will finally be able to study something I’m deeply interested in and live with my boyfriend, and even moving itself felt fine at the beginning, I love organising and list making, so I was excited for all the packing, but then the horrible truth came to me. I can’t take everything.

I have a lot of things in my room. I rarely throw something out, even my shoes I still have the ones I wore in 4th class of primary school, and every time I changed to a new model I kept the old ones. I’m really sentimental towards many many things, and now when I have to choose what to take with me it’s just pinning me down.

Obviously I’d take the most important like my dinosaur collection, my mangas that I bought in Japan, my stones, my plushies, but I have so many books it’s impossible to take all of them. The new apartament will surely be small I know I will have to leave 80% in my old room at my parents house but it’s just so hard for me. I feel so safe around these things they give me kind of comfort zone and I’d love to just move my whole room to the new apartment so this zone gets moved with it, because that’s kind of what’s been holding me about this whole move, that I will take my things with me, cus these are what’s really makes my room „mine”.

I could go on and on describing my situation but eventually I’ll just start to loop myself, I just need some advice from people with similar problems, how do you deal with moving and choosing what to take with you. I feel like crying on the sole thought of leaving even little bits. Before I moved only once in my life and it was literally moving to an apartment next door and this time is other side of the country. When I was moving that time I even took a dead bug that’s been lying on my windowsill for quite some time and I keep it in a small box on my windowsill and I will be surely taking it with me. But I have so many other things like an old bottle of coke from my 18th birthday that we’ve been tossing around and playing with friends.

There’s just so many things, I’m sure I’ll take them with me eventually somewhere this is just university apartment for max 3 years, but still it’s hard for me, please help.

Edit: when overthinking about it I came to conclusion taking even half of the things wouldn’t make it good either because I’m moving them from their original place, I don’t know if that makes sense, but thought of my room with those empty spots of things I took with me is like thinking I died and my room is now left empty with pieces of its soul taken away. If that is so, I’ll take as little as possible for my room to stay untouched, so when I go back I can go back to my complete room, and not the one with pieces missing. I lowkey feel like I’m losing my mind by thinking about it. Now I’m not sure if I should even take my mangas from Japan and dinosaur collection. Maybe I’ll leave it there and take only minimum, and after moving out completely I’ll just take everything with me, so the soul of my room won’t be that much damaged. ",1755173760.0,0,1,autism,autism

Hi, I recently got an adhd-diagnosis. The practice specializes in adhd and doesn't diagnose autism.

Autism runs in my family, more so than adhd I'd say.

My psychiatrist and therapist said I show 'attributes of autism' (excuse my English in advance).

My sister got diagnosed autism at an early age and I developed and interest since. I strongly considered autism in myself and concluded that I don't have it.

My self-diagnosis is me being an awkward and very socially aware kid (I could explain social rules and how social situations are supposed to play out (+ pattern recognition) in extreme detail - freaks people out, I also love sociology).

My question is, is the comment from my psychiatrist and therapist worth pursuing an assessment? I'm honestly torn because I can't decide whether I should even take it very seriously.

1mpu59l,Autism discord servers,"So. This is just a rant/vent, that's all it is really. A rant about discord servers that claim to be super duper inclusive to neurodivergent and mentally ill people. But that aren't really.

Right. I've joined this autism server and this other server, and both servers are very much displaying themselves as 'safe, inclusive spaces', like they make you fucking research DID and 'otherkin' stuff. Which is a lot more than most servers I've been in, but anyways. It's nice to be informed, sure, yup.
BUT, but the thing is, tell me WHY I'm messaging in the autism server, this person asks me something I don't understand, they're trying to tell me how to stop 'pinging' them, right. (I had no idea what that meant) so I was furiously googling it.
Turns out pinging is when you reply to a message and have the @ button highlighted. So... to me, being a dumbass it came across to me that this person didn't want me _replying to their messages_?? I didn't clock the whole @ thing and just genuinely thought this person didn't want me replying to them. That's what they seemed to be telling me repeatedly anyway.
So for context I'd had a discord account for ages, but not actually joined groups and stuff. So I had NO clue what they were on about. So I'm sitting there like a lemon that's been airdropped into a conference meeting about cereal brands. Basically I'm clueless.
Literally no clue as to why this person is demanding that I stop replying to them after they replied to me. I'm just holding my phone and staring at it in terror, because.. what..??
So I say something like ""oh I'm really sorry I don't really understand, do you not want me to reply to you?""
This person then sends a stressed/sad emoji, like two in a row.
By this time I'm feeling fucking stressed out, I'm sat, clutching my phone, sweating. (In case you haven't noticed, I have social anxiety)
I'm thinking, fuck, how do I respond to this?
Then this person sends this ""I'm uncomfortable"" emoji?? So, literally it's an emoji that says the words ""I'm uncomfortable"".
Just straight into the chat. 
I'm sitting there, thinking, bro do you not think I'M uncomfortable as well??? I'm here, holding my phone, shaking in my damn boots, because I have no idea how to respond to any of this, or what to say. I don't want to be doing something bad obviously, I was just being chill, chatting in this server, now it's like I'm being held at gunpoint and being interrogated about my knowledge on seahorse breeds, and if I slip up I get it in the jugular.

Now in the chat this person who sent the ""I'm uncomfortable"" emote has another person comforting them and then another basically telling me off and trying to very confusingly explain how to not @ them. I mean, these people weren't saying ""dont @ this person"", they were saying ""don't reply to this person"", which to me is genuinely crazy.
How are they gonna see your messages if someone else says something different  before you can write your message fast enough to pop up under theirs??

In fact I was so stressed I zipped over to hover over my poor, long suffering mother's shoulder, and started yapping about the whole situation and showing her the texts. Now my mother is also autistic, technically not diagnosed, but, you see, I had to get my autism from somewhere and considering I don't have another secret mother and father, the blame falls on them lol.
Anyways the point of me saying that, is my mother struggles with socialising as well, but since being an undiagnosed autistic girl in the... I wanna say.. 70s (???) (Good lord my memory for numbers is bad) she has had amazing practise in the art of masking and analysing every little social cue and clue and adopting it.
But even my mother with her heightened neurotypical faking abilities listened to my anxious jibbering, explaining the situation, and asking how best to reply, she made the kind of facial expression that penguins seem to make 24/7, e.i, devoid of any knowledge or intelligence on the matter.

So I reverted to what any autistic does in any situation that's remotely stressful or uncomfortable: I apologised profusely and exited quickly.


I now know that to stop 'pinging' someone you just tap the '@' button so it goes grey, or whatever colour it goes. So that's cleared up i guess. Would have been nice if the people in that server could have just told me that, instead of acting like I was a strange middle aged man watching a kids birthday party from afar and refusing to leave.

And this keeps happening in the autism ""safe places"" I go to on discord. People get really aggressive and pissy about the whole ""not pinging"" thing. I get if you don't wanna get a notification. But.. why not just mute discord or find an easy, kind way to explain it to people?
(I have met 1 person so far that explained it to me and was chill, which is why I now know how to do it.)

Now.
Today, I was in another server, now this server wasn't specifically for autism,  but was very heavily 'safe' for neurodiverse people and mental illness, they were the server I mentioned up top that made you research 'otherkin' stuff, so they're very inclusive... supposedly.
I was in a ""room"". This server has rooms where people can talk about stuff. They're mainly owned by random people, they can 'open' the room and 'close' it by saying whether it's open or closed, and you can ""knock"" to enter. Each room has a different theme and slightly different rules.
So. I'm in this room that's spider-man themed (because I fuckin love spider-man) I'm just hovering, seeing what people are talking about. The room is open by the way.
I see someone use a bot command that I didn't know existed. (So if you don't know what bots are in the context of discord, it's like a (I presume ai) thing that can follow commands, it's made of code and stuff, you can do stuff with a bot and earn made up currency or rewards and stuff.) (me saying ""do stuff with a bot and earn rewards"" makes it sound like the bot is doing sex work, but no lol, I'm talking about random fucking stuff, like, for example if you send ""/kick"" the bot will reply with something like; ""you just kicked me in the head, heres 5,000 fucking cookies"".)
Anyways.
So. I see the person use a command I've never seen before, I think, ""oh that's cool, what a fine and dandy command, I've never seen that before, I think I'll use it and see what happens.."" 
Fatal. Mistake.
I use the command.
A mod responds to me, saying I shouldnt use bot commands here.
Okay, so far, not too bad, definitely nerve wracking, because yay, I fucking LOVE having an anxiety disorder that makes me scared 24/7 of people telling me off. (Also yay past trauma)
I say something like, ""oh okay, sorry, I didn't know that was against the rules""
I then get a user reply to me saying, ""Dams doesn't like people xe doesn't know using bot commands in Dams room""
At first I'm just looking at this message, wondering what fresh hell of zero brain compatibility I've unknowingly and unwittingly stumbled upon, whilst simultaneously wondering if I'm just fucking dumb at this point and should give up my attempts at socialising completely, and live in a hole, or preferably get transported to the shire in middle earth and live out the rest of my days smoking pipe weed and sitting under trees, until, I realise they must be talking about this person while using neopronouns. 
Cool.
I go to the profile of the user this other person is talking about, just to worl it out for myself, and 'Dams' is not in their pronouns OR their name, it's not even a derivative of their damn name or username.
WHO IS DAMS??!

Neopronouns are fine I guess, I'm not going to lie, they're simultaneously confusing as hell and cool af. I mean let's be real, having your pronouns as ""death/death"" is fucking cold. But also ngl, ""dollie/dolliself"" is a little... cringy, TO ME ANYWAYS, it goes either way, but whatever, you do you. 👍🏻
With all these thoughts racking my brain, I quickly apologise and reply, ""I'm sorry, I'm still getting used to understanding how the rooms work, I didn't know, sorry""
I get an immediate reply, that was replying to an hours old message where I was clarifying how you're supposed to enter a room. You're supposed to ""knock"" I found out. This message replying to me having asked about how to use the rooms says something like ""So you've been told how to use the rooms before, this is your second time being confused? /neu"" 
They put the neutral tone tag, to indicate that they're neutral about this statement.
I mean it didn't sound neutral to me, but whatever lol.
In a panic I fall on the old reliable ""I'm so sorry, I didn't realise"", etc, etc.
Because I literally didn't know.
The anxiety is increasing at this point and I'm wishing that I could be swallowed up and disappear from the texts. (Yes I get that ""i wish the ground swallowed me up"" online as well as in real life.)
I then get a reply from this person saying _""respectfully""_ they and Dams are tired of people saying ""they didn't know"" and that I should look at the rules.
At this point I'm feeling conflicting feelings of intense anxiety and building irritation. I'm about as irritated as I imagine fish are when they're suddenly yanked out of their sitting rooms by a metal hook for simply eating the worm that suddenly started levitating in front of them.

To me, these kinds of interactions are worse that those fucked up saw traps. I'd rather get swiftly stabbed in the gut a couple of fimes than have to dance around other people's (highly offended) sensibilities.
But I am the type of person that wants to please, I want people to like me, or at least find me mildly tolerable. I want to make other people comfortable, because I like treating people the way I want to be treated.
I'm happy to accommodate other people. Hell, I'm a fucking autistic wheelchair user, I need accommodation too. I get it.
But what makes me fucking jibber and start having overdue anxiety attacks is being witch hunted and targeted for making a simple blunder.
I am blunderous.
I blunder.
God forbid a guy blunder.

In a server dedicated to making it a safe space and supporting everyone, it seems kind of trash to behave like this.

So, since this user kindly informed me that I was fucking dumb and didn't read the rules, I frantically scroll up to the top of this 'room' page, where the room's rules are listed.
_Surprisingly enough_ there isn't a single word mentioned about using a bot being against the rules of this room.
But. I remember what the mod said, that nobody should use a bot in another person's room.
But. I also remember the messages I saw, clear as day, clear as the gengar plush on my bed, of other users using bot commands happily and without repercussions in the room, just seconds before I did so myself.
So.
That must mean that Dams friend was saying that Dams doesn't like when strangers use bot commands in their room, or xier room. (I'm sorry I genuinely don't remember what pronouns this person uses)
But if that is the case, why the flying fuck didn't it say that in the rules?
Why then, does this friend get to ""respectfully"" impersonate a passive aggressive SEN teacher?? (we've all met them, they're the worst.)

Like, god forbid I didn't know the secret rule you and your friend have that isn't written down anywhere??
God forbid I got stressed about it.

Of course I'm apologetic that I made these people upset in the first place, but I really don't need that kind of stress.

Do these servers not realise that people get anxious?
I mean, for me currently I've had two major bad events happen in the span of a week, my dog fucking died a few days ago and I just found out there's a possibility that my mum has cancer. (Please not, please not)
You'd think, understandably, I happened to be a bit slow on the uptake and shaken.
Obviously I didn't say this to these people, because in this server you have to censor adult stuff, and a lot of stuff isn't allowed to be discussed, and I really did NOT want to get into trouble again for trying to explain myself.

Also. Do they not realise that people can have cognitive problems that affect their ability to remember rules and shit?
Personally my only learning difficulties are with dyscalculia, but they don't know that, I might genuinely just need help in that area, and anyways I was genuinely struggling to understand what the fuck they were on about, because it literally didn't make sense.
For a server that makes you learn trick questions about DID to join, they are amazingly unaware of how clinical anxiety, neurodivergence, and poor mental health can affect someone's ability to remember rules and stuff.

It's weird, with these people and in both cases I've discussed, it doesn't seem to matter how many times you apologise, they're still upset by you.
It's kind of a weird mentality in these autism spaces of not thinking about how you.. I guess affect other people?
Of course not everyone is like this, it just keeps happening to me.
I'm not even joking, I got a little tearful about it, just because I really struggle with this stupid kind of terror I get when people tell me off, it stems from this awful abusive teacher I had.
And you'd think in this server mods would keep in mind that the people using it are all messed up (as it's literally advertised as a safe spaces for people like that) and therfore, you should be gentle with them?

I mean, I'm going to out myself here. This second server I've talking about is primarily an ""age regression"" server, personally I'm not really 100% sure I do that, i just know that as an autistic I find comfort and safety in ""childish"" things and liked the idea of a server that was based around comfort and nostalgia.

There are people in this server straight up typing literal ""googoogaga"" esq, baby noises in the chat, yet I get in trouble for being a bit confused?? One might even say... child like??
Make it make sense!

It seems that unless you have DID or are regressed as a 2year old, your emotions or mistakes aren't tolerated in these spaces, and it's genuinely.. _odd_.
DID is super fucking rare, autism and anxiety are pretty common.. it's weird that the staff don't seem to.. understand it I guess.

God forbid I suffer from my conditions/diagnoses, the same as these people with DID do, just in a different way.


But anyways, hope you all enjoyed my insane ramblings, if you made it this far :)

I like to have them as I go through life, but also struggle with them. There are far too many situations, where I cannot prepare properly. If I start to think things through and there isn't enough information available, I become frustrated. In the end, things can be very different from expectations. I gave up a long time ago and developed a 'just let it happen' attitude. Sometimes my bf does all the organisation for holidays, because I'm detached.

This still causes me some stress, but alternatives seem harder. Planning overwhelms me. I haven't had a proper job yet, but I try to trust that problems will be solved as they arise.

1mpxnaf,Before you knew about Autism did you come up with any of your own explanations for some of your Autistic qualities?,"I was diagnosed with Autism as a child but I think in early childhood I came up with some of my own explanations for Autistic qualities in myself, not necessarily in terms of explicitly thinking certain things with words but sometimes in implicit ways that I saw myself and the world.

For instance I think several years before I learned I had Autism I had an awareness that I scripted as a vocal stim even when I wasn’t talking to anyone and noticed that characters in movies and TV, especially often main characters, seemed to have monologues that weren’t directed towards other characters and implicitly thought that the reason for my scripting behavior was related to the monologues that TV and movie characters had.

I think also I knew that I had an affinity for patterns and noticed that in nature there are a lot of patterns, such as the day night cycle and life cycles of people and animals, and implicitly assumed that because there’s patterns in nature that naturally I would like patterns as a reflection of that.

I think I also knew that some of my behaviors were repetitive but didn’t think that that could be what made them unusual because I noticed repetition in the behaviors of others.  For instance I noticed that songs were repetitive, and I noticed that people eat and sleep every day and so I think I thought of my behaviors being repetitive as being a reflection on how everyone else is rather than actually thinking that such behaviors were something that could make me different.

I think I also had a feeling of being different and sort of assumed that was because I was basically the main character of the universe because I noticed that I only ever saw the world through one point of view similar to how in a movie the main character has their point of view presented the most.",1755169985.0,1,2,autism,autism

The doctor then changed my antibiotic to a stronger one. Three days later, I broke out in hives, and my doctor told me I was probably allergic to penicillin. At this point, my leg is looking worse than it was before.
Third try: cefadroxil. Everything was fine at first, but on day seven, the hives and intense itching returned. To the ER again. They ran blood tests (finally), and it turns out I'm allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins, which, from what I understand, have the same component as penicillin.
This has been the worst health-related experience I've ever had. Everything itched and burned, and I couldn't do anything to make it better. I cried so much because I was so uncomfortable, and no one seemed to understand what was happening. Even a nurse said I was overreacting at first. (My mom almost yelled at her)

Every single normal sound of life is annoying me. I hate the sound of people speaking. I don't like music currently at all... It just sounds like useless noise to me. Reading or writing anything is torturous. I don't like watching anything on TV or listening to any podcasts or anything. It's to the point where I don't want to even have my eyes open. The sight of ANYTHING is just annoying. The only relief is sleep.

I'm not replying to any of my friends messages anymore because I just have nothing to say and I'm so agitated that I can't concentrate on reading or writing. 
Speaking to anyone in person feels impossible currently.

I usually watch a lot of movies and listen to a lot of podcasts but hearing humans voice their stupid opinions over and over is getting on my nerves. When people speak it just sounds like dogs are loud barking to me currently lol and the sound of my own voice annoys me too so I'm speaking as little as possible.
Also I live in an apartment building that allows dogs and there are two seperate dogs barking non stop.

I've been feeling unusually depressed lately so I'm sure depression is part of all of this. I work in construction and the loud noises of all the construction equipment is driving me bonkers. I've done this for years so I've learned habits to deal with the loud noises but in the last week I'm finding it unbearable.

I'm thinking about asking a doctor for Seroquel (antipsychotic) which I took years ago in that past for anxiety. But this was back when I didn't have an autism diagnosis and I didn't know much about autism. And i am thinking Seroquel worked so well for me because it worked great for agitation.

I had people throw crumbs at me, was a fill in space for birthdays (i was never directly invited, only invited the morning of when there was a cancellation or an extra party bag), I was never invited to sleepovers, i got body shamed, bullied for enjoying interests that others started enjoying, got laughed at whenever guys showed interest in me. i was insulted, called weird and even called ""ew"". A lot of this bullying was shoved off as ""misunderstandings"". 

Going into secondary school wasn't any much different tbh, but that was mainly just words, I'm going to college now with 3 friends and one of them is my partner. With having childhood experiences like that, i can't help but question what do my current friends see in me that others dont? or do they see the same and just dont care about it? and if they do, why did everyone else care to the point i was thrown crumbs at by people again at 14 years old ? was i called asexual cause they thought i was or it'd be hilarious to even think anyone would have s3x with someone like me? did i ask someone a lot of questions why the broke up with me or was i confused why there was a sudden change i didn't realise?

1mpqg2h,Quick 2-min survey — designing a portion control tool with autistic needs in mind,"
Hi everyone,

I’m a student working on a design project to create a portion control product for different needs — including for autistic people.

If you’ve ever found portioning food tricky (due to sensory issues, food texture, visual layout, executive function, or how existing tools are designed), I’d really value your input.

The survey is short — under 2 minutes — and your responses will help me design something that’s genuinely practical and accessible.

1mpq90y,When I was,"When I was a child, I used to tell stories. Stories of grandeur, stories of war, and all to try and fit in with the laughter and comradery my father shared with his friends with drinks around the living room.

My stories always used to start with the same phrase, “When I was in the Army”…   Hearing my father repeat that phrase, I learned that when you said that the room fell silent and for a brief moment, people listened.  
When you are young, what you have to say does not matter. You are simply entertainment or a nuisance.  With this single phrase I was able to somehow shift the room from apathetic to mesmerized.

Today 38 years later, I see so much of myself in my son.  
He is full of stories of all kinds. Stories of his mother, stories of his friends and stories of imaginary monsters that go on incredible adventures, but he never has to start any of them with, “When I was in the Army” Whether he is talking to his mother or his father, we both listen, pay attention and engage with him as a real person.

“Kids are people too” That phrase has been around for years but there is a reason behind it.  
The fallout of treating children as subordinates instead of people with logical reasoning and opinions is a society of adults who are unable to gauge self-worth and individual strength. If your own parents wouldn’t give you the time of day, then what hope do you have of deserving anyone else’s?

Worth is not just something you wear on your sleeve, nor is it what you have in your bank account.  
Worth comes from sound morals and love for people who offer love and care in return.  
Worth comes from offering help to those who need it, even when it puts you out.  
Worth comes from admitting faults and wrongs.  
Worth comes from saying, “I’m sorry.

1mpesgu,Insecurities when dating a neurotypical,"(26F) Most of my life I have always dated other neurodivergent people, at least ADHD minimum usually both ADHD and autism like myself. 

Before when I dated neurotypicals, I didn't know about my autism. As I only got diagnosed at 20. And I also wasn't as disabled by it. I was in different ways. As I have got older Ive become pretty immaculate at masking, to the point that I have more social skills and charisma than neurotypicals, I can pretty much go up to anyone on the street and strike a conversation and get chatting etc. But because I made it my special interest due to being insecure about previously being socially inept slightly during my teens. Now because I mask so heavily and I'm an adult in adult world. I get burnt out really easy. 

I've started seeing someone recently and whenever I try and explain to them how disabled I actually am I feel like they don't believe me. They always hit me with 'yeah but you don't seem autistic'... No shit. I've spent years trying to pretend not to be disabled... I've tried to explain to them as someone who's just finished uni that I've rarely been able to hold a full-time job down for long. Longest I had was 6months, but otherwise my other jobs have always been part time (as I've been uni etc). But I find working and socializing very draining. I feel like they listen but they don't understand and if they do... The other issue is, I am insecure about being autistic. I'm not when around neurodivergent people and most my circles are. But being in close relations with a neurotypical like this and me being aware and accepting and understanding my autism is new. I find myself having fears of doubts in the sense that they will grow to resent me because of disability or they will think I'm lazy... Or perhaps they will just think I'm a loser. I don't think they do initially, but I'm afraid it's something they feel underneath there silence. 

I am not sure if this is me projecting my own insecurities or perhaps I am detecting some mild resentment subconsciously on their behalf.

They are kind to people. Although, I can be kind to others even when I don't emotionally care. I suppose they are doing the same thing.

Some things that confuse me:
They have referred to a term they use for me as something reserved for those they care for. 
They also said family is the people you choose and lamented English only having one word for family. 
They have been upset with someone for upsetting someone else.
They have texted me to stay safe and sent a crying emoticon followed by you're too kind.

1mpt23j,Need to understand if I made a social gaff.,"Obligatory I'm ASD Level 1 and just looking for some social/communication advice from the community.

I was in a conversation recently with someone that was complaining about people who shouted at other people unreasonably for abusing their animals.

I said ""surely that only happens if they actually harm the animal?""

The person said no that they shared a picture of their cat being overweight and people started calling them an abuser.

Now in the UK that would be considered abuse. You have a duty of care to your animals that includes giving them a reasonable diet.

I asked them a question. ""Who is responsible for making the animal fat if not the owner?""

The replied to me ""see?""

I said i dont see and explained about the duty of care thing.

They then kept on trying to goad me into some kind of extreme reaction saying things like ""this is hilarious, keep going i'm sure you have more to say.""

I just told them i didnt want to continue the conversation and that it seemed clear they were trying to goad me into a chaotic reaction and that they want validation thay they weren't harming their cat which I wasn't going to give then.

They still tried to goad me, saying something like ""go on, I'm sure you have more to say.""

I told them I dont know what they want from me, that it was a simple situation and everything had been said.

I thought the whole thing was done but then someone else chimed in and started telling me off for suggesting he had abused his cat. Telling me I was just doing it for self aggrandisement and saying I was a bully. They told me I acted like a crazy person.

I said no we had a relatively polite interaction and I asked them a question that they refused to answer and instead tried to goad me.

This person just wouldnt let it lie they kept coming after me and in the end I asked them to stop harassing me and told them I was done with the conversation.

They didnt stop and told me that if I kept responding to them I was asking for it. I called them abusive and they called me a cry bully and said I was just looking for the last word.

I told them to take the last word and that I hope they jad their fill of bullying with me. Let them have their last abusive response and walked off.

So i guess the question is, was I really acting crazy like this person said. Was it so unreasonable to ask that question?

It seems to me if they loved their cat they would want to take some responsibility for it and someone else caring about wether they did shouldn't make them angry or try and goad me into the way they did.

I'm into my 40s now and sometimes feel like I'm well practiced socially, then a situation like this comes along and shoots my confidence in my social skills to pieces. I know I'm going to be ruminating on this for days, when I'm not flashing back on it later.",1755153835.0,1,9,autism,autism

1mph1y9,How do I communicate better with my daughter?,"
Hi, I’m not sure the best community to ask this question. My daughter is 15 and recently diagnosed. We are in the UK so don’t have levels but I’m repeatedly told she is high functioning, which is a term I’m not really comfortable with but just want to provide some background. She is academically capable, but socially and emotionally has not been able to attend high school, she burnt out when she transitioned to high school and maybe has attended a few hours a week since then. So long and short of it is she has not had structure and routine for a long time, she has friends she may see once a week but the rest of the week can be quite isolated and she spends a lot of it in bed. She struggles with day to day life, won’t go to the shop, tidy her room, ear properly, sleep at night, brush teeth etc. When she has meltdowns they are mostly verbal and directed towards me and this is where i’m looking for advice. They will normally merge into an onslaught of everything i’ve done wrong in her life and she will call me things like pathetic, mean, self serving, selfish and so on. I naturally get upset at this and can get defensive and she says i’m then making it all about myself and she can’t express her feelings about me. I feel her style of communication is not ok but she feels it is honest and I need to be able to listen and accept it. I also feel a bit upset as i definitely make mistakes  as a parent but try so hard to be supportive and to get her the right help, but im struggling with this and she doesn’t really engage with any offers. How can I speak to her about trying to communicate her feelings in a way that isn’t about putting me down or am I wrong to try this? She isn’t open to family counselling which I would like to try. These melt downs can happen weekly and it’s becoming very difficult for us both to cope with. ",1755120093.0,4,5,autism,autism

1moqxfi,I will never be fully understood by anyone,"I am not normal. Yes, I’m aware this is, in general, a social construct. Saying I’m not normal is like saying a type of clothing is ugly- purely from my point of view. Only one perspective of many- many, many thousands, who have their own perceptions of me. But as a society, we have placed social boundaries to maintain order. Loonies are imprisoned, voices are suppressed, dictators rise to the top, weak sink and strong rise, if you fail you’re vermin, people who fall cant be saved. We see someone, and we judge them- we make assumptions, we feel that because of social rules, we should follow along and place labels on people. Not that I think this is particularly bad; it helps us establish when things are “too far” and order in society is an absolute must. Im talking about the bigotry, the bias, the misconceptions, the narratives.

Ive been through thick and thin. Abuse, disease, disorders, confusion, but it always comes back to me— why am I like this? Everybody leaves, everyone’s scared away. Nobody sees my point of views that I bury back in my mind after rejection, rejection, rejection. They don’t like how much I talk; or how little. How serious I am; or how aloof I am. Because in this world not being the “norm” is alienated. 

  At a certain point, I wonder. Like the saying, “if one persons an asshole, they’re an asshole. If everyone’s an asshole, you’re the asshole.”
I wonder— am I the problem? These pieces i have missing, that others have, no matter who I talk to. Fellow disabled folk, neurotypical, therapists. They look at me and I know in their face, they just can’t fathom it. My life and how I think.
All my life Ive wondered, why bother. Why talk. Why make friends? Everyone leaves me, hates me or is scared of me. Eventually, I decided that being the odd one out meant I was a freak. I cuddled into my little shell, and no matter how much I grew I wouldn’t leave, no matter the pressure on my chest.

I don’t know what to say to them. I don’t want to have to speak. The only thing I’ve ever wanted is someone who silently, knows, and takes that self hatred away. I want to know that I am not the odd one out and the freak. But never, have I found someone who’s been through what I have. It’s so painstaking. Keeping it to myself, because I know I’ll get puzzled looks. I know I’ll humiliate myself, and marinate in self disgust when I open up.

1mpkp3e,Was this support worker abusive? How should I handle this situation? Am I at fault?,"There is some stupid automatic thing that thinks I'm trying to upload pictures of things if kitchenware words are in the post so I have had to edit those so sorry if this is now illegible.

The situation in brief.  
Two days ago I was struggling a lot. I've been seeing a new psychiatrist who put me on an antidepressant and then told me to stop taking it two weeks later when it did what I explained to him all antidepressants have done in the past and put me in that nihilistic 'what the fuck is the point of living, why do I even try?' mood. So I was about 48 hours into withdrawal from that. I was extremely emotional, which for me, typically means staring into space and constant apologizing.  
This was essentially how the first hour of that shift was spent. Sitting on the couch in tears apologizing over and over.  
I've worked with this individual for several months. He should have spent enough time with me to be aware of my condition. He was also aware of the medication situation.  
For days he had been doing things which I now believe to have been abusive. Three days prior to this he had started swearing at me struggling to do things he was telling me to do. When I asked him if I'd upset him later, he claimed he was 'being abrasive on purpose to get me to leave my comfort zone'. At the time this seemed like a reasonable explanation, but I think the events of two days ago have now recontextualized it as a lie.  
Yesterday, he tried to get me to get in the car to go out for something to eat. But due to a series of appointments, my kitchen had been a mess for days as I hadn't had time on shifts to clean it. I told him I needed to do that (My policy with these shifts is typically that support workers do not clean for me. My goal is to become independent, but I struggle to realize things need to be done and to break goals down into tasks. The role of the support workers is largely supposed to be prompting me as to what needs to be done. I say supposed as we have had consistent issues getting them to actually do this.)  
While I was washing, he was sitting at the table doing essentially nothing.  
I find washing kitchenware distressing. Normally I handle it reasonably well. Yesterday I wasn't. I was already extremely overwhelmed, and couldn't find a place to put the kitchenware down beside the sink. I ended up in what I call a 'loop' which is essentially decision paralysis and panic, my hand kept switching back and forth between two places I wanted to put the kitchenware down, neither of which had room to do it. I grew frustrated at my inability to overcome this and let the kitchenware go, which caused a loud crash.  
The support worker immediately seemed aggressive, at least as far as I can tell, I struggle to identify the emotions of others, hence my difficulty being able to tell if his claims of 'being abrasive on purpose' were a lie or not. First he took the kitchenware I was holding away and put it in the dishrack. Then he forced me to sit down at the table. I was already at this point very much overwhelmed, something which has happened often with him and he should be able to identify.  
He began asking me why I'd done that. I tried to explain the situation, but I struggle to communicate well when overwhelmed, even if I can do so well under normal circumstances. All I was able to express was 'I couldn't figure out where to put it'.  
He seemed to grow more angry at this and started telling me about the dishrack. I was aware of the dishrack, though it hadn't occurred to me while panicking. He seemed to think I wasn't aware of it's existence and kept telling me to turn around and look at it. I wanted to explain that this was not what I had meant and looking at it wasn't necessary, but was unable to communicate, as I was feeling threatened.  
He then explicitly threatened to grab my head and forcibly turn it around to make me look at the dishrack. I would have liked to express that if he tried, the situation would escalate very, very quickly, but again, I wasn't able to speak. I was already in fight or flight waiting to see how I needed to react, and hoping he would realize how badly this was affecting me.  
He then threatened to forcibly drag my chair around 'so I could look at it', which again, I was unable to respond to. Even now, I do not feel his seeming obsession with making me look at the dishrack served a constructive purpose or would have been acceptable in his role. I suspect he was just angry and was venting his emotions and lashing out at me, but I can't be sure. But I don't think this was a reasonable choice or course of action. Still, I do not understand these social nuances. I cannot be sure this was inappropriate behavior to everyone, or just to me. The way the company has treated it so far suggests this behavior was entirely appropriate, so I'm somewhat confused.  
At this point he did actually get up, grab the back of my chair, and attempt to drag it, at which point adrenaline kicked in. This is somewhat of a trigger. Grabbing the back of my chair is something other students used to do daily in school in an attempt to provoke me. They would do it over and over and the teachers would do nothing, but when I turned around and punched them, I would be punished. We are talking daily, multiple times a day. It was something that made me feel I always needed to be on guard and looking over my shoulder, and always ready to defend myself. In his defense the support worker was probably not aware of this. My memory of the next few seconds is spotty as it tends to be during these situations. I remember the words 'Don't fucking do that', though I cannot be confident I said them or just thought them. I remember being on my feet and holding the chair, with him also hanging onto it. I remember telling him to let go, and him doing so. I remember choosing to slam it to the floor and managing to control the urge to defend myself. I remember turning my back on him and taking several steps away while crying, to which he asked what I was doing. I remember telling him 'leave', and him immediately doing so.  
For context, this is the first time in five, perhaps six years with this company I have had anything close to a violent reaction. I understand the context I've provided about my experience in school may give the impression I can be a violent person. I'm not. I'm a person who's been through a lot of violence and become quick to react to it when forced to, but also a person who dislikes violence. I do grow agitated and express my frustration, but I am never abusive or violent towards my support workers, and I wasn't in this instance either. I reacted, but didn't cross either of those lines. I'm rather upset that I was put in a situation I felt I needed to react to in the first place.  
I have explained the situation to a representative the company sent over, and was told my explanation 'more or less' aligned with the incident report he had filled out. However, the company has made no apology, nor given any indication his actions were considered out of line. There has, as far as I know, been no disciplinary action against him. As a result I have instructed them to cancel all my shifts.  
This company has been good to me, and has gone out of their way to do things they really weren't require to to help me multiple times in the past. I like the CEO and feel he understands me and my needs well. There's at least one other employee that I trust and have complete faith in. There was a third I held in the same high regard, but he has since left the company. I can no longer work with any of these individuals due to various reasons (too busy, now working in admin instead of doing support work, and left the company respectively), and the last person I've worked with in the long term (the potentially abusive worker in question) is clearly no longer an option. I don't think I feel safe continuing to use their services. This isn't the first time a support worker they've provided has lost their temper and shouted at me, and escalating the situation to manhandling me is, to my mind, completely unacceptable and speaks to a negligence in training and workplace culture. I also feel it's likely I've become a 'problem client' and source of frustration in 'water cooler' talk, potentially biasing new workers against me before they even meet me. The basis for this is that my needs are different to the needs of their other clients (prompting me instead of doing things for me, assisting me with organization and helping me identity what to do instead of just following orders) which I've been told in the past has created the impression I'm difficult to work with.  
At this point I'm feeling the best option may be to leave this company and to start over with a different one.  
However, I also understand I can be very sensitive and unreasonable with these things when I feel threatened and wronged, so I may be biased and making a poor decision as a result.  
How should I proceed from here? Was this support worker being abusive? Should I continue to work with this company? What should I do?  
Also, am I a problem client? Is what I'm asking from these support companies unreasonable? I struggle to organize myself and know what to do or how to break things down. I also don't have access to an OT currently, as I've repeatedly tried to see them, only to find they only have experience working with children and insist on trying to work with me (a 36 year old man) the same way they do with them, by handing me a pack of crayons and a worksheet that mentions 'school' and 'homework' in every sentence. The last one I saw I spent three sessions explaining my needs to her (in this instance, organization and social skills training for communication in the workplace) and she showed up on the fourth with a book about idioms. I'd literally used idioms multiple times while trying to explain my needs to her. My expectation is that if I'm trying to use these services in unreasonable ways or ways they don't or are unwilling to train their employees in, that the company will communicate that to me, so I don't think I've done the wrong thing here. They seemed fine with it whenever I've spoken to the office about what I need support workers to do, but it seems the workers themselves consistently grow frustrated being asked to suggest things that we could do instead of just cleaning my house for me.",1755128872.0,3,13,autism,autism

1mpk6uo,I wish my mom could understand what she says hurts me and that I am an adult even if I process things differently (vent),"For context, we had a... HUGE argument. I'm around 20, if that matters. Diagnosed since I was 3(?) and I realized I was autistic when I was 13-14 (my parents didn't disclose this and left me to figure it out again so I took another test for it in 2019) I can also drive, I've been holding a job for 4+ years, I pay for some of my stuff, I go to college, I've been left home alone for like 5 days on end, and a few days less long on at least 3 occasions. For like dinners and stuff I'm also left home for the evening. I am independent, I struggle with some stuff more than the average person does but I am more than capable of functioning.

The way I view the world and present myself is already different to what she expects of me. I love her and I do genuinely believe she wants the best for me, but being neurotypical (or perhaps very well at masking and ND in some way) the experience she has with autism remains... well she can't really understand the way she views the world is gonna be different to how I view it.

I usually get along with her, but when we have heavy arguments like this, shit gets real. My dad's arguments can also hurt, but I don't know if it is because they are less frequent or more personally motivated, but as time goes on I've always been left feeling more hurt by what my mom has said. Yesterday we got into a huge fight over me texting a friend of mine late at night. I told her we are both adults and it didn't really matter and she screamed and went ""YOU AREN'T AN ADULT!"" and while things were already tense, that broke the camels back and we started to exchange words.

 I was sobbing like a violent mess and it didn't help that my day had already been going to shit as I woke up for work late and had to apologize to my manager with tears in my eyes while she and my mom were frantically texting each other as I was driving. I came back and I knew I was going to be lectured, I just felt it, but as soon as she called me downstairs to help her with dinner she went in with a ""we are going to have a huge talk"" and I knew it was going to go south. She accuses me of talking to my friend late at night, I argue about being an adult and she screams that I am not. 

And then all I can remember is me telling her how she doesn't understand and how I feel like she loves me but doesn't like me. I know she loves and wants the best for me, but I don't think she likes my interests, my habits, or what I do all the time. I know for a fact that a lot of my interests are unconventional and ""weird."" I know for a fact she does not like a lot of things about online friendships and doesn't view them under the same lens as real ones, though I'll give her credit she's learned to accept them and I appreciate her for that. 

I think she misinterpreted that as me not thinking she knew she loved me because she went on about how if I'm so unloved and mistreated I should live by myself. Or that she came to this country when she was my age and had to rely on nobody to get through life. Or how the world isn't going to be kind to people like me and she's preparing to send me into a society where I just can't take things to heart or act the way I do. There was a talk about how I never give people a chance, and while I struggle with irl interaction and understand it is a thing to work at I also reminded me I had a lot of trauma surrounding irl friendships and interactions due to years of being excluded, harassed, and nagged by people who were my peers and even people I considered to be friends, good friends included. I wish she knew what it was like to grow up knowing how much people don't like being around those they deem different. How isolating and hurt it feels to just KNOW when people laugh AT you, or when people find you boring, and when you come out of your shell someone seems to give you a reason to stay stuck in it. I'm working on breaking that, but it's tough and will take a lot more time to get over than I expected. I appreciate her telling me I need to give others a chance. I just wish someone in my life outside of close family had done the same to me.

Back the talks about the online friend, but she accused me of being obsessed with her. That staying up talking to her texting was not normal and that is was a sign of obsession. That I wasn't her therapist (which I never claimed to be, just because I'm an ear for those in need at times does not mean I don't have boundaries and we always make sure to ask each other if it's comfortable for the other to vent), that she would call her parents to make sure she knew who she was (obviously not going to happen), or that she works with people like me who get so caught up in what their friends say online they get sent to psych wards. I'm not sure what she was implying with that, but god that broke me. I know she wouldn't send me there, but man... I hate being a comparison to her students. I also feel like it is incredibly insensitive for her to treat the experiences of those kids she works with like that. I'm very much certain those teens are more than that too.

I also got accused of manipulating her, of making excuses, and of bullshitting whenever I tried to explain why I was feeling the way I was or whyf I was acting ""aloof"" this summer. Every summer since 2023 I feel like I'm just... being told that I've ""changed"" and that I'm no longer who I am? I'm not sure if this is because I see my parents more due to not having a busy college life like I do when I go back in the academic world and they see more of my authentic self but like no. I am who I am. I am not ""changing"" if anything I feel the most of myself during summer and online. I wish my parents got to see more of that but sadly they're learning at a different pace (as am I) about autism and while they're very progressive (they dislike a certain president very vocally) and speak against blatant ableism but its stuff like what I mentioned above my mom struggles with. Sadly my therapist is very much someone who also tends to side with my mom (due to being paid by her lol) but my tutor turned irl friend who's ND is also somewhat a therapist for me and has made many remarks and complaints about how my mom perceives things and wishes my mom would let things go too.

I also have an issue when I get told I'm making an excuse for texting a lot and explaining my story. I really hate being accused of making an excuse when I'm just giving more information to explain why something happened or got in the way. I really wish she didn't perceive an entire paragraph of rambling as some get out of jail free card. Especially when she tells me she wants me to use details when explaining something I need to do or in my school work.

I don't know. Sometimes I'm just very hurt, and I feel like my mom is as much of a victim of my autism as I am. I'm stuck with a condition she can't understand, and she's stuck forcing herself to pretend she can understand me. I don't even need her to know every little thing about autism, but I just wish she understood that when I tell her something regarding how I process things, or to not yell at me, or to not tell me something hurtful, she would understand it's not a personal jab at her. She's told me a lot of hurtful stuff and I know she would and does get upset when I hold it as a representation of her. ",1755127546.0,3,1,autism,autism

I am currently employed but I’m planning on handing in my two weeks very soon and trying to find another job. (Also if anyone has recommendations for part time or full time jobs that don’t require a lot of experience that are fairly neurodivergent friendly I’d really appreciate it!)

1mpnvks,does this happen to anyone else? im confused.,"so like i was wondering if anyone else experiences this or if you know why i do? i feel confuswed almoist all the time and i feel like people treat me differently.

for context im 14 years old, female and have autism level 1/low support needs, adhd, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia and dyspraxia  (fairly bad dyspraxia like i need to have one on one swiming lessons with a coach specialized in disabled people and i need to go to a therapist kinda person to teach me to use my arms and legs right and i might have to see an ocupational therapist for sensory stuff and fine motor skills, i mean i can take care of ymself but im still below where i should be and i think i walk kinda funny but i dunno) and at school im fairly open about that i dont mask (i think i used to but subconsciously stopped when i was learning more about autism and now i cant mask and it kinda sucks) and when i started at my high school i wore earmuffs a fair bit and had a full time Teachers aid for a few weeks to help me adjust.

so like i have very little social skills im not sure how related that is but i do and i am so confused all the time i hardly ever understand whats going on and i try to follow everyone else, its not that im dumb my iq tested for high average (115) so at very least im of average inteligence its just that i cannot read the room if my life depended on it, i cant read facial expressions that arent cartoon obvious and whenever i try to get out of ym shell and be social i mess it up like today at the school library i overheard the librarian talking about a film festival to some people so i asked what a film festival was and the two girls she was talking to just looked at me like i was an idiot or something like they just looked very confused and it was embarrassing.

and like people talk to me different espeically teacher aids and my old teachers aide and i used to go to RDA (riding for the disabled) and everyone there talked to me like i was a little kid i just feel like when people hear 'disabled' they think 'five years old' and like i know i act weird and it doesnt bother me too much cus parts of my brain are underdeveloped but i hate it when its to the point that they use that high pithced tone and too many compliments people use with toddlers like at RDA i was complimented profusly for the increadibly difficult act of leading a horse/sarcasm. i think its abelism cus i openly stim and stuff and i dont respond how people expect of someone my age and im kinda in my own world

Why. It. Tastes. Different. EVERY. Time. 

i mean i still always end up eating it but i don’t have THAT enjoyment.. 

for some reason every time i grab a new one to eat it tastes differently, its a gambling experience almost!

some times it tastes sweet and exactly what i was looking for, and sometimes is my LEAST favorite way that it tastes.. i have no clue why its not consistent!

1mpcglg,"My therapist warned me not to get diagnosed. How risky is it, really?","I live in the United States & I'm a 19yo black female. Political tensions are high here and I don't want to ignore the real issues that could affect me.

I've known that I'm autistic for awhile. Multiple therapists I've worked with have validated that they think I'm on the spectrum. I got diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago, and they also made me do an unofficial autism test to rule out the possibility of autism.

I scored high on the test, indicating autism, & my doctor recommended I get an official diagnosis which is a much longer test. **But,** I'm worried about getting diagnosed because of what my therapist said to me. She said that it could be risky to be diagnosed with the direction the country is going in & she wouldn't feel right telling me to get a diagnosis. But she but did not elaborate.

But... I feel like I need that validation because I'm struggling so bad in my life. I had to drop out of high school & I am unable to work and I just feel so useless. I can't even fully validate myself because I can't tell others I'm autistic since I'm not officially diagnosed. So, I'm held to the same standards as people who are regular. I just feel so useless because I can't bring in money or anything. And that's what's expected of me.

I know the reason I want to be diagnosed is very much for other people. I already know I'm autistic. I just don't know. I need some advice here please. I hope I explained myself well. ",1755109729.0,5,29,autism,autism

1mphbc0,What's the way to find a safety romantic net while being an autistic teen?,"Hello guys!

I'm 17, Pole. If that matters? + diagnosed!

Basically, I've had plenty of relationship/friendship problems since childhood, but at least not severe (I'm technically an Aspie). But there was always a thing I've lacked - the thing of talking how neurotypicals talk.

On the other hand though... Of course I have friends!...

...but that unfortunately does not mean for me that I can hold a conversation for long or anything. I've known my homies for a bit of a time and the main reason we are attached is that we play the same online pvp games and... that's all! Literally my whole speaking with people experience is either:  
\- yapping about geopolitics for hours like a monologue (I love it)  
\- commenting things happening on my screen.

But holy, there's puberty, the lil' puberty that makes our lives feel more... sexually attached? I think that's what should I call that phenomenon.

And yes, I've had *some* contact, but in comparison to neurotypicals - that's literally like nothing.

And it ended not so well cuz ended with harsh abusement, my neurotypical friends stun when I talk about it, lmao. Also, 1st love, so yk - a bit unexperienced I should say.

So it ceased my desires to find somebody, at least for the *short puberty years*.

But the will of being attached to somebody and feeling of safety have emerged drastically for many months.

So I tried a meeting app for teens which is kind of popular here, stated clearly that I ain't a neurotypical person and a bit weird, but at least it does not stop some people from adding me back.

But... absolutely no idea what to do with them.

I talked to some of those, but the convo ended like... literally every convo with my friends if we're not playing games haha

But here's the problem, cuz I can kind of live without hanging out (I barely do so), but my inner natural desires are natural desires which I can't for now overhop.

Is there any chance for me?=)))

What should I do??

\+ oh, I forgot one thing - I barely can even imagine a conversation with a human except for the ones I have I mentioned before, tho those are also hard to do so.

1mp71ko,"I want to be re-evaluated, but my only option is the person who I believe misdiagnosed me","Back in 2018 I was diagnosed with BPD and Bipolar II instead of autism, when I went in thinking I was autistic. I STRONGLY believe that she misdiagnosed me and I have gathered a lot of “data” to show this. 

First of all, this woman admitted to me that she didn’t evaluate adults often, mostly children. My state has TERRIBLE resources for adults with autism without an accompanying diagnosis of an intellectual disability. 

Second of all, the evaluation was NOTHING like others have explained. It consisted of two appointments; one I sat in her waiting room and filled out surveys on an iPad while she sat in her office. I misunderstood some of the questions and it made me look like I had psychotic features, which I don’t, something she later acknowledged. 

The second appointment was the part with all the little tests she gives, which seems consistent with what others say. With the little puzzles and so forth. 

But she did not interview anyone in my life. Not my mom or my husband or anyone who has known me for any length of time. She also did not take into consideration that I have had all my traits and “symptoms” since early childhood (around toddler age). BPD and Bipolar don’t begin in early childhood (to my knowledge and understanding).

Also, I think she has confused my AuDHD traits and my past trauma for what she thinks is BPD/BP2. Basically every symptom I’m showing of BPD and BP2 can be better explained by autism, ADHD and past trauma. 

Like, impulsivity and risk taking behavior, but that can be linked to my (previously diagnosed) ADHD. Or fear of abandonment, but I’ve experienced LOTS of valid abandonment trauma, so it makes sense that I would have a fear of abandonment. Or my mood swings and anger, both things also often connected to ADHD and autism. 

Then there is the fact that there are many things I don’t do, like sabotage my healthy relationships or have mania or hypomania of any kind. 

Since then, I gave birth to a little boy who was diagnosed with level 2 autism at 2.5 years old in the spring. I recognized characteristics of autism by 7 months and was right. 

I want to be re-evaluated, since right now I am technically diagnosed with ADHD (previously diagnosed), BPD, Bipolar II, MDD, and generalized anxiety, when in reality it’s probably just autism and ADHD. The problem is, the only person who would evaluate me (that insurance will cover) is the same lady that I believed misdiagnosed me.

Should I go back to her with the knowledge and evidence I have now? 
- son is diagnosed level 2
- She never interviewed family members which is common in evals
- My traits are lifelong, since toddler age
- I have collected and categorized what I think are autistic/ADHD traits in all the three categories of the criteria for diagnosis 
- Every noticeable characteristic/symptom of BPD/BP2 can be better explained with autism and ADHD
- I do not experience some of the key characteristics of BPD or BP2

Is it fair or appropriate to bring all of this back to her 7 years later and ask to be re-evaluated? At the time when I questioned the diagnosis, she said she had no other tests to give and that’s what the tests said. She said that I COULD have autism, but it was hard to tell with the other stuff in the way. Is it fair to assume that maybe she has learned more about late diagnosed autism in adults since it’s almost been a decade, and would it be appropriate to tell her I think she’s wrong and here’s why? I just don’t have another choice for psych evals, they’re hard to come by up here. ",1755097704.0,5,4,autism,autism

1mpirox,Looking for Tips/Tricks on asking for help as an Autistic person.,"# As an Autistic person who struggles to ask for help, have you found any tips or tricks to make asking for help less stressful?

\-------------

My partner and I are both late-diagnosed ASD (in our 40s). I am the AuDHD flavour of the household, a high-masking phantom that was so good at it I fooled even myself for most of my life. My partner is more of a traditional, less-social individual with a very vibrant internal life (Eg, living in your head and not in the physical world).

In the past few months I have found that as we go about our own ways of trying to heal past traumas/wounds/etc. , one of the issues that we both seem to share is asking for help. And I mean asking for help with ***anything***, it does not have to be a big life situation like moving or starting a new job, it can even be little things like help with organizing or cleaning up a shelf, help with learning a new skill. The most recent example that just ended up in an emotional discussion was using whetstones to resurface some of the kn\*\*es**^(1)** we have at home as we both enjoy baking/cooking.

What I tend to see a lot on this forum is that in response to these problems it becomes a bit of an open mic on relating to others via misery, and neither of us are looking for that; It's hard to live in a world not designed for folks with ND issues, but neither of us have the time or energy to sit in that sadness for long periods of time without doing something proactive to solve it. The problem? We're still autistic adults who are 'new' to the autism game and in needing to find ways to ask for help that gel with our lifeskill set, we sort of get stirred up in the actual process of asking for help and it devolves into emotional outbursts or severe self-loathing in a way we cant seem to find a way around. 

**So, for the TLDR crowd** (or anyone who read this post in its entirety)**, As an Autistic person who struggles to ask for help, have you found any tips or tricks to make asking for help less stressful?** Again, we empathize compassionately with everyone here and understand that we all go through things differently, but I'm looking for *actual answers* on this question and not 1\~2 sentences of commiserating. This is clearly an issue that makes many of us very upset and sanguine, and we're looking for possible solutions or personal anecdotal evidence towards ways that other Autistic Persons approach this issue.

The most recent example i have is this. My dryer recently broke, it doesn’t get hot so I’ve been having to air dry them. Doing this makes them feel awful. They’re incredibly stiff and not soft at all. To most people it would probably be okay, but it feels like I’m wearing sand paper, its so uncomfortable. I’m also really sensitive to light and sound and stuff, and I was just wondering how to explain it to someone without making it sound like I’m making a big deal about nothing.

1mpgm34,I need help helping my son socially.,"Hello everyone,

I've lurked here for quite a while, I like seeing the different perspectives that people have here that might give me insight into what my son is going through. On more than one occasion I saw someone going through something here that I thought mirrored his experience and the look on his face when he realized that I understood what was going on was priceless. He was diagnosed on the spectrum very young--we had our suspicions when he was 2 but the pediatrician thought what was going on was, ""just a phase"". Anyway, over the years we have done as most parents do, try to make the best decisions we can at that time and hope they turn out right. Some have, some haven't been so good but we both try really hard.

My son is now a teenager, he was able to skip a couple grades in school and unfortunately the special needs school he attended could no longer meet his needs so we parted ways. Since then he has attended a virtual public school(like legitimately part of our county's public school system--not some guy down the street streaming youtube videos). The problem is that he gets NO socialization, he's not around kids his age at all. He's SO desperate for social interaction but it's, like so many others experience, one of the scariest things in the world for him! We've tried taking him to functions around town that have bowling events and little social functions for people on the spectrum, or that struggle socially and he has such a hard time with that. Do any of you know of any safe online spaces where he can connect with other people? He likes playing online games, roblox is a fave, he has a few others. I just worry about sending him to an online community with a couple weirdos hanging out in the corner waiting to pounce on a young kid. ",1755119061.0,1,4,autism,autism

I was maybe 7 in this picture. I was diagnosed autistic (I didn’t know until I was 13 because my mom didn’t believe it was right and then didn’t tell my dad). My mom knew what to do to help autistic meltdowns and knew how to recognize them. I was clearly throwing things and trying to get a point across that she was not understanding. I understand her not getting it but taking a picture and posting it on Facebook to show her screaming child that everyone can see her (I distinctly remember this happening maybe 20 times before I masked my meltdowns into shutdowns). I also remember one time she posted a picture like this with the caption “I’m looking to get rid of this kid, does anyone want her?” And then showing me the comments of her college friends all saying “no she looks weird and babyish” and stuff like that. 

To this day she refuses to admit she did any of this or acknowledge that it was traumatic.

He has given me good advice and ideas in the past, but he tends to seek to be dominant, make me feel small, show off, and put in a position that is secondary and supportive to him and his immediate family that he can control. He has become very successful, healthy, good looking and popular and my family worships him. They believe and follow everything he says. He wants to be friends with me, but partly because he had pushed me into psychiatry (taking psych meds) my life got derails 5 years ago (I had a bad reaction to the meds that he pushed on me and became sort of deranged myself and lost my job and housing partially).

He keeps pushing me to go to a gym, often his own gym, and in the past he had been shoving him being at their vacation house (I am invited to come, but it is their house, their rules, and I am supposed to fawn over them) and now he is living in his amazing apartment with a hot girlfriend and he obsessed with her, shoving his amazing life (he goes to a gym daily and is in amazing shape) in my face.

I went from being a supportive older sibling with a job and housing and savings guiding him through college and getting his first job, to being a fat unhappy loser with a miserable job who can't attend family events (partly because he bullies me when I get there and puts social pressure on me). I let him abuse me because he was younger, wouldn't take No for an answer, and it seemed like I had no choice if I wanted to support him. Complaining just causes him to gaslight me and tell me I am overly negative. I was told in the past that he is not my friend, and that I just don't see it due to autism.

I feel a bit of relief, as I had a feeling I was and I think if it had been a negative diagnosis, it would have put me on a bit of a tailspin as Ive had a few struggles over the years etc... so it feels comforting to now have some sort of explanation.

It also felt a little anticlimactic, like ""Oh, okay. I'm autistic"" and realising nothing has really changed.

I read through my report, and apparently I didn't meet the threshold for the ADOS-2, but the mutli-disciplinary team that assessed it decided there was still enough evidence from my other interview and questionnaires etc... to meet the diagnosis.

1molk51,I can’t do this anymore,"I don’t feel like I can live my life anymore. I am broken, I am beaten, I am burnt out.

All I ever wanted ever since I was little was to be loved, to find my soulmate. When I was 10 I fell in “love”. I wouldn’t know until almost two decades later that this was limerence, but at the time it felt like the most powerful love in the universe. It ended up being a heartache and a loneliness I carried with me for almost 10 years.

I was so lonely, so desperate. When I was 19, I was the only one of my friends who had still never been in a relationship, never been kissed. When I did finally start getting into relationships, I was so desperate that I took anything I could get.

I poured my entire soul into my relationships. I made big romantic gestures, I sacrificed my own mental health for theirs, I did everything to keep them together when they were falling apart. In the end, I was taken advantage of by every single one of them. I’ve been cheated on, abused, manipulated.

I finally got into a healthy relationship with a good person, but it’s too late. Now I’m the shitty partner. I can’t put effort into my relationships anymore. I spent a decade putting everything I had into my relationships, only to be used and thrown away like garbage, and then when I finally found a good one, I’m too broken and beat down that I have no effort left to give. Every ounce of my energy is put into just keeping myself alive at this point.

It all just feels like a sick joke. Like dangling a steak in front of a starving dog, but by the time you finally give it to him, it’s too late. The starvation is already too deep, his body too far gone.

I’m so tired. I’m tired of working 40 hours a week. I’ve lost all passion for the things I used to love. I can’t read books anymore. I can’t write anymore. I used to be so smart, genius level, and now I can hardly put together cohesive sentences or do basic math. My memory at this point is comparable to dementia.

I can’t see a therapist. I’ve tried. Even if I find a good one, I can’t get myself to open up and talk to them. Will it even matter? There’s no way I can possibly explain what’s going on in my head, all the trauma I’ve endured. It’s too much. I feel like I’d need years and years to explain just how much has happened and how deep it all goes. Where do I even start?

I have no friends, and I don’t know how to get new ones. Every day I feel my social skills degrading more and more. I can’t make appointments. I can’t sell my car that’s been sitting there unused for a year. I can’t do anything anymore without help, and I have no one to help me.

I don’t want to die. I really don’t. I had dreams once. I wanted to travel the world. I wanted to see every inch of this gorgeous planet. I wanted to save animals. I wanted to write a book.

But I don’t know how I’m going to live like this another 5 years, let alone another 50. I have nothing left in me anymore. I just can’t do it.

It doesn't take much to make me cry or shake and I'm 27 years old. My independence is impaired and as soon as I am alone, such as when I tried to live on my own, I break down. I am also sensitive to stimulation or agitation. Vitamins can be enough to make me euphoric and ssris make me restless and unhinged. When I tried to take a mood stabilizer, I became anxious and started crying because I had no friend, no support system and the thought of medicating myself totally alone scared me. The thing is, I need this type of support to start treatment but I don't have it. There were moments I hated myself and the world for not being able to help myself or having support but I am trying to accept that maybe I am not meant to take any medication. I cannot force people to want to help me neither force myself to forget my traumas, and although everything is harder without medication, I can still live. I would prefer feeling relief now, but I have hope there are other ways because I truly don't see myself being able to take medication, the fear, anxiety, sensitivity are too much and I'm tired of begging others to help when no one wants to.

1mosofy,My autism isn't “dumbness”or “retardation” and I'm tired of my family acting like it is.,"
Today the family went out to a pizzeria and there was the adult table and the young table (for some reason). It was one of this long tables with a long stuffed sit stocked to the wall and on the other side normal chairs. I of course went to the stuffed sit and went to the corner to make room for the rest obviously. I know my cousins consider me “the weird one” but I never thought it would get to the point to not sit in obvious spots just to avoid me.  It’s ridiculous.

At one point, one of my aunts notice this and orders them to come sit near me, and the faces they make were basically of disgust. 

It’s little things like this why I hate being autistic. Because adults (my parents included) somehow think autism = dumbness or retardation. So they always tell me I’m misinterpreting things, or that I don’t understand my cousins, or that I’m not viewing their perspective, or that I’m exaggerating things. And even if they believed me, my cousins would never admit it, let alone change. It’s like being racist.

However, last night, we were at an amusement park and my mom decided to tell me that I had a dentist appointment at 2:30 the next day, after we had planned to stay home and pack the rest of my stuff. That was fine with me, but I was really frustrated today, as she decided to change plans last minute. I had a rough night with all the stress of adult life, I was up until about 2 am just trying to figure out my issue with online banking, for whatever reason they aren’t letting me reset my username 🙄. So as a result I slept in, until my mom very rudely called me to let me know that she had changed my appointment to 2.5 hours earlier. It’s a 45 minute drive so if I was going to get my run in, I only had about 20 minutes to do so. So I got ready as fast as I could and headed out the door. I had to rush because I only had so much time. I got back with about 10 minutes to spare, so luckily I made it back in time. But I was so frustrated. My mom has a tendency to make changes last minute and when I ask her to let me know in advance, her response is always, “I just told you.” I was just a little nervous with the rush and not being aware sooner. Normally I book my own appointments but with my dental issues, my mom and I see the same dentist. Luckily everything went well.

On my way there was some construction work being done so there were orange cones laid out on the road. As far as I know, if there's construction they usually cover the left turn light to keep traffic flowing. But it wasn't covered and I needed to turn left. So while the light was green I was waiting for crossing traffic to go before I could turn but I was blocking the traffic behind me. I didn't mean to do that, I pulled up so cars could go around. Then one of the construction workers told me to go straight. So ended up going straight around through some businesses in order to get to the doctors office. That should have been the logical thing to do. But I also thought if the left turn light wasn't covered I should've been able to turn when it was safe to do so. I felt embarrassed, confused and now anxious because of it. I'd decided to go a different way home because I was afraid of passing by the construction workers again with them possibly thinking ""there goes that idiot that blocked traffic again"".

My dog is healthy but has been in vet a lot due to one reason or another over the span of a year or so. Recently he had to get 5 teeth taken out, even if he’s doing good. It still affects me. 

I’ve recently lost a childhood friend due to how narcissistic and toxic he became, I tried to help him but I was met with harassment. 

Last year I was constantly working too. didn’t have much time for breaks or anything. It was with my parents who also constantly worked like I did.

I’ve taken a long break and now  i’m trying to work again but I can’t seem to find work at all.

1mpbh8t,"Almost 10+ of misery and burnout, I’m dragging down the people in my life, I’m stuck and don’t know what to do","Long post incoming, tw for suicide

I’m 28 years old and it wasn’t until last year that me and my therapist have realized I most likely have autism, or at the least ADHD 

It all started with me moving out at 18 and starting college. I finished my associate’s degree with little issue but I couldn’t figure out a career path to move forward for. Going to university didn’t appeal to me because I’d have to move to a new city away from my friends and family and I even had a meltdown at orientation for University because of the overwhelming fear that overtook me

So I decided to stay in the workforce. I quit my job at McDonald’s that I held through my time at college, almost three years, and moved on to a call center that paid more and offered full time hours

Big mistake. 10 hours at a desk endlessly speaking on the phone to people, sometimes who would verbally abuse you for being unable to help them for things out of your control…I attempted suicide and never showed up to that job again.

The next five months was spent rotting away in my apartment, expending my savings account to pay bills, and trying to find employment and eventually giving up after trying two more jobs that ended with me walking out either due to crippling anxiety from coworkers and customers or from this newly discovered vertigo I would experience from standing/sitting for too long. 

My girlfriend’s family was gracious enough to allow me to move into their place the new year of 2019 with the stipulation I find work, and work I did find. Another call center. I lasted 8 months before the same thing happened after they tried to schedule me 6 days in a row 

I spent the next few years through the pandemic doing BiteSquad (and eventually Doordash after they went defunct) delivery to get me a small amount of spending money. I was also medicated on Wellbutrin and was feeling better with many of my symptoms. This led me to earn my A+ certification and seek out IT work, which I ended up finding in the form of a work from home help desk (another fucking call center) 

Wanna guess what happened? Yeah…I never did IT again. 

Went back to DoorDash and started online school. 

Got a job at a grocery store. Same pattern again 

Moved to another city with my girlfriend. My financial aid money from college plus my girlfriend’s disability payments funded our bills. I was one year from graduating so my plan was to move on to a better job afterwards

September 2023, my car that enabled me even a chance at survival got into an accident on a rainy day. Couldn’t afford to fix it, didn’t have insurance that paid for accidents if they’re your fault, so I lost my car. Got $400 for junking it and I basically completely gave up on my life. I got a job at a Dunkin’ Donuts and bought a bicycle to try to get by but eventually the heat and stress got to me eventually and I crashed once again. This time I got fired for being sick too much. My Wellbutrin stopped working ages ago. My days were spent rotting as I struggled to find SOME form of income online

Roommates decided to move so we had to move back down to my girlfriend’s family. 

I got back on medication, but the Wellbutrin made me super sick and I am now on Effexor and Strattera which helps some but makes me drowsy and nauseous a lot, and my executive function still suffers 

What kind of life can I even live at this point? How do you guys make money? My disability application has already been denied for both Medicaid and SSDI. I don’t have health insurance, and the cheapest place I can get evaluated is $1500

I’m on the verge of giving up, I really am. I’m trying so fucking hard to do game development and I can’t even get the fucking energy to work on that. 

The only jobs I qualify for pay the bare minimum and are the type of work that drive me insane anyway. I’m a fucking perpetual failure who has failed every endeavor I’ve attempted

1mov7h1,I’m 27 and just found out I actually belong here (:,"I used to be pretty good at masking, but the past few years  I started letting go more and I would just start stimming in public without thinking about it. Or getting stuck making a weird face stimming with my hands or biting my lip just thinking, in public just zoned out because I was so over stimulated. 

The other day I met someone who I think is just like me, I can literally feel that she is just as autistic as me. Extremely socially awkward but so detail oriented when it comes to work. She’s legit a genius. Why even follow the social rules at that point? So many of you here are geniuses who will never get the credit because of ASD. 

I’ve had 3 hour conversations with unhoused people at tea shops, and this one guy who claimed to be a professor at the local university told me all about his trips in Japan with a rich CEO while he was smoking weed out of a tin foil pipe. Before this, he was just shouting out loud to himself. 

I didn’t notice anything else around me , I didn’t think to or even gauge what we must have looked like sitting in front of this tea shop. When I think back to these times, I realize how long I went doing the most autistic things imaginable without any awareness of it 😅

It’s depressing at first but then I end up laughing about it and I’m just like, “lol why are you like this ??”

All that to say I want to connect with more people like you all who understand this unique experience. 

It feels like that one scene in the Matrix when Neo was walking around in the simulation, and the AI suddenly notices him. Then they all start chasing him. 

I’m afraid I will stop masking all together one day and lose everything because life IS social. 
But at the same time I want to just let go. 

I would never make you feel guilty for that sarcasm flying over your head, or misunderstanding those lightning fast directions, you are amazing friend. And you deserve to let go and take the mask off, to be accepted for your natural self.

I was officially diagnosed with Level 1 autism last month. I had suspected it for years, and I finally decided to go through the process and get tested. Getting the diagnosis was actually a relief. It felt validating. Since then, I’ve been slowly sharing the news with my family and my closest friend.

But honestly, it’s been kind of a shit show. There have been accusations about where I got diagnosed, people questioning why I even took the “weird” test, and the usual “it’s all in your head” stuff. They even got mad at me for getting diagnosed. What the hell. I’ve just asked them to try to learn more about what autism actually is, but so far, only my younger sister has been supportive.

I think because I used to work in a high position and was doing well, they now see me, taking a career break, as being lazy or shutting myself in. But the truth is, I’m going through a serious breakdown. I’m trying to hold it together while healing from years of internal suffering.

Meanwhile, everyone else either doesn’t give two f*cks or still feels entitled to emotionally dump on me, as long as it doesn’t require any effort from their side.

Recently diagnosed and all childhood markers (now) point to autism and ADHD but growing up in the 80’s these were generally not as well known as they are now. Was preliminarily diagnosed BPD and schizophrenic as a teenager (at my assistance because I knew there was something wrong- I wasn’t like the other kids or my siblings); and my parents chose to disregard those diagnoses (luckily) but I was the odd duck in the family although even then I knew I was different. Mom taught me not to be myself but how to behave in public- masking. This created tremendous issues for all of us and it has only been in the past few years, before they died, that my parents and I made amends.

My brother who is a child psychologist suggested that adopted kids suffer from varying degrees of both physical, mental and emotional trauma stemming from life before adoption; he said that the act of moving from one environment to another and then moving into a new culture that does not recognize your cultural differences impacts the trauma experienced for adoptees and thus can attribute to negative Autistic experiences. Those adopted as babies or toddlers (like myself) may not even have been aware of this but just felt there was some unknown wrongness in their childhood. 

This has been weighing on my mind after I talked with my brother a few weeks back- writing it out helps me to understand that adoption trauma is not my fault and my brain is trying to resolve something that may never be resolved.

*recently learned this term from a different subgroup. It means that the adoptee and adopter are from different ethnicities. I don’t like using the term “race” because genetically, the human race is one,  but anthropologically speaking, we are different ethnicities with different genetic variations.

1mp4sod,2 year old diagnosed with autism. Wasn’t diagnosed with a level and is considered verbal. Need some support and some advice!,"Hello!

My 2 year old girl was diagnosed with autism last week (no level), right after having my next baby. Right now she is in speech therapy 2x a week. She is starting at a mainstream preschool 5 days a week in September and also starting EI. 

Right now, she has the following words she uses consistently: more, open, milk, all animal sounds, all colors, all done, up, ready set go, and a few more action words. She loves to repeats words we say but doesn’t technically use them intentionally. She can fill in the blanks of words like uh uh choo and also for songs. She has limited screen time but we let her watch Mrs. Rachel and Mickey every once in awhile. She follows directions sometimes and also responds to her name sometimes. 

Her speech therapist is confident she is going to get there eventually. She has only been in speech for five months and started out with nothing so I know she is making progress.

My question is, if your child is considered verbal, when did they start using words intentionally and holding a conversation? 

I work with her at home all day as I am a stay at home mom. 
Also if there is any tips or advice you can give me to help with her speech that would be awesome too!

We’re starting to have some conflicts that are causing meltdowns for me. They’re minor conflicts and unintentional, but it’s hard to deal with. Basically, my boyfriend has a really dry sense of humor so he makes jokes in his normal voice or very monotone voice. It’s really confusing for me and he doesn’t understand that he’s supposed to change his voice when he’s making a joke.

For example some jokes he’s made include:
- telling me he wants 10 kids
- telling me I can’t have a smoothie when I wanted one
- telling me he wouldn’t use a booster seat for future kids
- telling me he wanted to get married the next day
- telling me my food was bad

These have all sent me into meltdowns and he doesn’t understand why. I think I would have understood them if he used a different voice. They just sound mean without a different voice so they’re really upsetting to me.

Man that likes me has made a mess of our plans to go out. I just wanted to see a movie. We agreed on that. Little did my poor soul know.. apparently going to a movie means a walk prior and not random parks and a shopping centre. Has he offered to pay for anything? No. I literally have no idea who's funds this is on and I can't ask because it's taboo.
Also I'm upset at him. I really like Hamilton and I really like musicals and I'm proud of lin Manuel Miranda . So I asked a "" would you rather "" question to him involving lin Manuel Miranda . Here is the conversation including that that I didn't like.


Me💘 : if lin-manuel Miranda came up to you and offered you free Hamilton tickets but there was a thousand and they were all neon and glowing and Lin looked crazy but you could tell it was him him would you say yes and take the tickets or else what would you do? 

Him: Is Hamilton a f1 driver ? 

me💘: No I mean this guy * insert pics of lin Manuel Miranda*

Him:what’s so important about this guy. ( Notice the full stop. Get a load of this guy.)

I responded with multiple paragraphs from Google selected by me about his achievements and how they impact today.

Me💘: he's the best. Really you will love Hamilton *facts about it and little anecdotes*

Him: did you write all this yourself ? *Referring to the copy and pasted paragraphs from Google*

Me💘: no I had them in my notes 🥳

Him: don't care about it then.
 
The fuck??

Me💘: * thumbs down that message  and changes chat to flames , symbolising hell*

Anyone have any thoughts on why he was so fucking mean he knows I love Hamilton. I genuinely think he might be jealous of Hamilton. that's not cute.

Then he said ""I'm actually playing the piano. You play any instruments?"" 
Like yeah just interrupt me and then talk about a piano you clump

Ok moving on I guess..?? Not like we were just talking about Hamilton or anything.. (sarcasm).

And now we're going out tomorrow on these disgustingly vague plans??! Do I know how I'm gonna get there? Fuck no
Do I know what time I'm back?? What food we'll eat?? Who's paying??

This guy SEEMS like he'll pay but genuinely I can't tell there's a lot of background you would need more but I can't rn.

I'm so stressed.

How do I get out of this?? A fake injury is too obvious.

He was mean ☹️.

I am upset and distraught. Why was he mean?? He interrupted me and said he didn't care. Why was he mean ☹️.

And guess what we're seeing it midday. Fuckass timing he knows I hate midday. Ugly word aswell, ""midday"" .

I'm not showered. Not shaved. Not happy at all. HE KNOWS I LOVE HAMILTON AND THEN HE SAID HE DIDNT CARE???? usually I'd be blocking here but we're going out and idk how to cancel . Only though ATM is ghosting ( blocking on everything and ignoring ) 

He's the type to misunderstand me and make me feel dumb 😞. Like not reading my tone. Thats why I keep saying hey I don't think you'll like me or find me funny it seems like you can't read my tone and I don't like misunderstandings. 

This is upsetting. And then he wrote after ""I meant it in the nicest way""

Hello one ticket to vaguetown please where I can eat vague food and vague drinks. Dear lord. Meant WHAT in the nicest way? There's no nice way to shut me down like that.


I am interested to know what you guys think. Was he mean? (Yeah, he was. I've told him how special Hamilton is to me)

What do I do??
How do I cancel??

1mp3w5p,how do I stop pushing people away?,"quick disclaimer- I believe this specific issue is caused by a mix of autism and (suspected) BPD. please lmk if this is the wrong sub. this is a side account only for these types of posts as I'd like to stay anonymous, not a bot! I also have anxiety, which will make a lot of this clearer.

I'm compulsively pushing my friend away to the point where they're becoming distant to me, and I don't know how to stop. since our friendship began, I've always been the person to initiate- it just kinda worked out that way, and we're both autistic, so it stayed that way and has been fine. however, recently I've had really bad anxiety, and with it the worry that I'm being overbearing and pushy.

it's rude to always initiate; go for a 50/50 mix, right? but how does changing that work with another autistic person? I *know* the answer- just fine- but I'm so anxious and scared to push them away and even though I know the harmful pattern of testing people I can't stop. I sometimes make myself initiate- just call, just talk to them, it'll be fine (and every time it is) but I'm worried that even with this they're feeling like I don't want them around.

how do I deal with this? how do I stop? I've had something similar before but that was irrational. this isn't- I know that they *will* get overwhelmed with too much, and that's ok, but it adds a layer of reality that makes the whole thing so much harder to break out of. please, any advice is very much wanted and needed.

tl;dr- I'm compulsively pushing away my friend by not initiating as much as I used to and not staying around them much at school. I know the patterns and reasons but can't stop because the behaviour is more rooted in reality (I know that initiating too much does cause real issues) than other issues I've had like this in the past. this also has roots in anxiety and possible ties with BPD",1755090296.0,0,1,autism,autism

1moz8ba,I don't feel taken serious,"Tl;dr: fuck this weather 🖕


I'm sorry just being a overreacting whiny little cry baby, I just really need to get this of my chest.

We're currently dealing with a (possible) heat wave where I'm living, and I simply cannot deal with this weather. It's currently 26°C/78,8°F outside, and 27,5°C/81,1°F in the store I work at. Weather forecasts predicted temperatures around 35°C/95°F. No, we do not have airco (too expensive according to my boss), no windows that can open, only 2 big doors, 2 emergency exits and a shitton of fans which doesn't help for obvious reasons.
I felt sweat rolling down my back when I entered the store at 8:50am while I was walking from the entrance to the breakroom, and I just knew I'm going to have a terrible day today. I just had to lay down in the bathroom because I started to become extremely dizzy and nauseated.

Where do I get the feeling that I'm not being taking serious? Well, I let everyone know I cannot deal with temperatures like this, it's causing shutdown and meltdowns. I've been told on numerous occasions that: 
- We all have to deal with this
- Just take it slow (I also have ADD, not going to work my dude)
- It'll be fine (no it won't, Iv'e cried 4 times today and it's only 10:50 am as I'm writing this)
- Just drink enough
- It's not that hot
- Yes we know, we all feel it (when I'm asked whats wrong with me)
- It'll be over before you know it!

I'm dealing with the disgusting feeling of sweat on my body the whole day, it's damn near impossible to cool down once I'm sweaty, I'm wearing as little layers as I possibly can but it's driving me insane.
No one seems to understand that it's not only the heat I'm struggling with, but also my clothes that stick to my body, the feeling of sweat I can't get rid of, the overal feeling of despair. I'm in constant sensory overload, I feel like I could cry at any given moment and I can't fix it.

 But oh well, it's only a little heat for about 5 days, everyone struggles with it, just shut the f- up 🤷",1755075354.0,2,3,autism,autism
1mox5ai,"The definition of ""autism"" isn't set in stone. It's infinitely complex, changing, and has no owner.","I used the communication flair because it's somewhat about communication, but it's really venting / making an observation / sharing my opinion, I guess.

I am getting  sick and tired of all the shit (online and offline) where people's hobby seem to be complaining about what others do or don't do, should do, or shouldn't do, all through the lense of bad faith and ""conspiracy"". Especially when it comes to autism and neurodivergence. (And yes, I acknowledge that bottomline that's (mainly) a ""me problem"".)

For the subreddit's sake let's keep it to autism. Please don't take what I am saying here as (an absolute) truth or way of thinking you will have to accept or believe. (That's out of my power. Rightfully and fortunately so since I am not a big fan of coercion.)

Every autistic person has their own flavor of autism, and yes, in some cases, there are overlaps. In some cases, there aren't. Also yes, some people share information about their flavor. There is nothing wrong or weird about that and it's an impossibility for an individual to represent a whole community (a 100% accurately).

When people judge you, based on such subjective information (shared by a person online or irl) for what that other person communicates, that's on them (the one judging). Turning that into something about yourself (and dismissing the information shared, because it doesn't represent your experience) besides being invalidating towards the person sharing this information, that's completely on you.

The content of the label ""autism"", so to speak (that what the label points to), is of infinite complexion and always changing. Hence the ""if you've seen one autistic person, you've seen one autistic person"". 

By trying to objectify / solidify / own this container term through taking my subjective experience as an absolute truth and applying that to what the term ""autism"" should represent when it is spoken of, I basically invalidate every autistic person with a different experience. And since all human beings are one of a kind, I practically invalidate all others. 

I do have personal preferences about how the term ""autism"" could be used, but that's exactly what it is, a personal preference (a preference that may not be the same as the preference of somebody else). Since I am not all knowing, nor a god, but just a human being like the others who post here I am not the one owning the definitive definition of ""autism"" (assuming such a thing would exist) and neither are you.

The only thing this whole mechanism of, ""imagining to own the only right definition"", will do make things worse and less safe by creating infighting and division. For me that feels very frustrating and it makes me feel both angry and sad at times. 

In my experience, all of this feels so much like a competition. Something like: ""Will the real autistic person please stand up"". Especially when it comes to the struggles that come with being autistic in a world designed for and designed by allistics. Every person (both autistic and allistic for that matter) will have their own struggles and suffering that comes from it. 

Again that's not a competition and dismissing somebody's suffering by claiming the suffering you experience is worse, isn't only dismissive towards the other person's suffering, it's also based on nothing but belief, not necessarily reality. It's impossible to fully experience the other person's suffering, so any comparison will always be (at least somewhat) off. 

What's wrong with acknowledging different people have different experiences / preferences / struggles, etcetera, I do me and you do you, and (as long as it's not hurting or damaging others) to live and let live? 

The way I see it is that at the end of the day, we're all in the same boat and all have, generally speaking, the same basic needs.

I know they were referring to networking, but I was just hoping for more than just “comment more lmao leave me alone now.” Then they suggested I make an online portfolio and I asked if they knew any free sites that didn’t have hidden fees to run the portfolio and they just said “ask ChatGPT.” For reference, I’m strictly anti-AI and I hate it so much so when I was told to use AI to generate a list of websites I could use, I just lost hope with the career center. I wanted real career guidance not “comment more and use ChatGPT.”

1mos9e7,Imposter syndrome and wondering if I should cancel my eval,"Hi. I have an eval scheduled next week because I heavily relate to so much autistic content, and so much of what I see posted on this sub. 

That being said, I don’t fit a lot of the qualities described and I am worried the evaluator is gonna laugh in my face when he sees how many non-autistic qualities I have.

For instance, I don’t think I had all the developmental delays autistic kids are said to have. I made eye contact, I was social and wanted to play with my friends, I learned to read and write at a normal or above-normal pace. My mom remembers me as being polite and well-behaved. I loved being touched and cuddled and still do.

I don’t have many childhood stories of meltdowns. Sure there were a few tantrums. But it’s not like what I remember from childhood nor is it what my parents recollect.

I love eye contact, and I’m 99% certain it’s not due to masking. I read body language and social cues extremely well.

I don’t have an ongoing special interest, but I do have interests I intensely hyper focus on until I get bored or distracted. I also am keen to listen to other people talk about what lights them up, even if it’s something that doesn’t interest me. I hate small talk with a passion though.

That being said…here are some of the qualities that make me want to go for the eval:

-comorbidities: ocd, adhd, Tourette’s, depression, anxiety (often debilitated by an anxiety disorder for the first 35 years of my life)

-sensory processing: I occasionally have shutdowns if exposed to cacophonous environments, sensitive to lights and certain sounds, can’t follow conversation without great effort when it’s loud and would rather just not talk than try to expend the eneegy

-people have often told me I’m talking too loud or standing too close to them and asked me to back off

-stimming, rocking my body to self-soothe when I’m in bed, holding my arms tight to my chest to ground myself 

-inability to summarize as a kid…writing the summary for a story or book was hell and took me hours 

-difficulty seeing the big picture, focusing on insignificant details

-I sleep with hella t-rex arms lol I don’t know how my hands haven’t fallen off yet

-surrounded by neurodivergent and autistic friends in adulthood and high school. Dated multiple autistic men before I even understood what autism was. 

-several autistic friends assumed I was autistic 

-strong sense of justice that has gotten me into many conflicts, destroyed relationships, and caused me ongoing suffering

-I used to collect dead insects as a child and even as an adult if I find a beautiful dead moth I will give it to someone I like as a gift

-I will often say things that offend others but will quickly realize why they were off color and apologize

1mp1blb,Does anyone else struggle with coping strategies?,"When I was younger I used to constantly binge eat and play video games to distract myself and to lose my sense of self and to let these other things consume me. When I got older I had substance abuse issues. For some people they could use weed or alcohol a little bit for me I always craved just losing control on it. Take so many edibles I couldn't feel anything. Drink until I was blacked out or almost delirious. I used to think the reasons for these was, ""Oh I just have a very addictvie personality!"" But I think it was actually because I was in so much pain when I was younger due to constant social issues, masking, and being afraid to know my true self after so many years of masking and smothering who I am. Now I choose to just go through life being more self-aware and putting awareness above distractions. But damn is it exhausting. I feel like after work all I do is try to relax from the day and prepare for the next. I completely self-isolate in the darkness for hours trying to process the day the best I can but it is just so tiring. Does anyone else have or had problems with bad coping behaviors? What do you do now, if anything.

TLDR;

Used distractions to cope: drugs, games, and food but now I don't and it's hard feeling everything. Do you share similar issues?

1mp0wpy,The connection between Autism and Trains,"Sorry if the tag isn't accurate but I didn't know how to categorise it. 

It's just something I've been thinking about lately. 

We've probably all heard some variations of jokes about autistic people being really into trains (I've got a really good one but it's NSFW so I can't share it here). 

I was just wondering where that comes from.
Are autistic people really more likely to develop a special interest for trains? And if so: why trains? 

I mean, I get it. I prefer trains as a means of transportation over anything else. Well, maybe I like cars a little bit better as long as I don't have to drive. 
Trains are more accommodating than planes, in my opinion. 
First of all, you don't have all that hassle of an airport and then trains often have ""quiet zones"", which airplanes don't have. 

But that stereotype of autistic people and trains is also that they have a vast knowledge of technical aspects, knowing all kinds of train models, etc. 

I basically just want to hear your thoughts and maybe there are some trains enthusiasts here who can enlighten us about why trains are so interesting. 

Oh, I'd also like to add an idea I've had to save the planet:
So I was at the Sisi Museum (Empress Elisabeth, huge deal in Austria, you might have heard of the Sisi Movies with Romy Schneider) and she had her own train wagon (which was faaaancy. Like she had her own bathtub in that wagon). 
It made me think: a). If I ever become filthy rich, I'll get my own train wagon and b.) If we convince rich people that personal train wagons are far cooler than private jets we save the environment + the train system will be improved, since all those rich people want to get to their destinations as quickly and efficiently as possible. It would be a win for everyone. ",1755081484.0,1,6,autism,autism
1mouz9c,I can’t make myself feel,"(TW! SH AND DEATH OF ANIMALS/RELATIVES) I’m not sure if I used the right flare, but I think it’s closest to what I am going through. So before I start off, I want to make it clear that I am not diagnosed with autism, I just think that I may have it and this could be related to it.

So I’m going through a really rough breakup right now, and I don’t feel sad. We’ve been dating for 3 years but I broke it off cause I was overwhelmed. I should feel something, but I don’t. I mean yeah, I’m bummed, but I’m not sad. I feel like I should be sad. 

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. When I was 7, my cat died. Maybe I was just too young to understand death, but I felt nothing when it happened. Then about 3 years ago, my grandma died from cancer. We were pretty close, but again, I didn’t really feel sad. A few months ago, my cat died in a pretty bad way that I shouldn’t share, and I didn’t feel sad. I don’t know what I felt. It’s a really weird emotion. That’s when I started getting worried.

Fast forward to when I broke up with my girlfriend, I started to get really worried. I don’t know what’s going on. I just can’t feel. So I tried to make myself feel. I haven’t self harmed since 6th grade, but I did tonight just to try to make myself feel something, and it kind of worked, but nothing changed.

The weird thing is, it’s not like I can’t feel ANYTHING, it’s that it just doesn’t work really well. I either feel big emotions, or no emotions. Sad things don’t make me sad. But I get mad easily, I get stressed easily, I get annoyed easily. Whenever I’m excited, I can’t control my volume. But I’m never just a little bit happy. It’s either big or nothing.

I often go into great depths on this, multiple times. Explaining scenario specific things, past confusions etc. 

One thing I keep noticing, however, is just how ineffective this seems to be. Maybe to someone you interact with very consistently, and after a long while, it begins to be somewhat effective but to pretty much anyone else it’s like talking to a wall.

I have suspected it at times over the past decade or so, but haven't said anything to anyone. I just figured I was ""different"" and awkward.

1mourt5,How to learn languages as an AuDHD?,"Hello!

I need to learn English and German, for work reasons. Currently, I start from only speaking Spanish and nothing else. I know a little bit of English, I know a little bit of Catalan, but nothing that helps me communicate.

I have always tried to learn English and I have ended up the same: with translators (I use reedit with a translation add-on), without understanding half of what they say (trying to watch YouTube videos only in English with subtitles, but since I don't understand anything I always end up putting the subtitles in Spanish). And the English they taught me at school is terrible.

The reason I need to learn languages is because I want to emigrate, so I will always need English to work anywhere and German, since it is the language there.

I am not a constant person, that has always been my main barrier. I left the language academy last year because I quickly became demotivated because they required minimal attendance that I couldn't meet because I combined it with other studies, and I left mobile apps like Duolingo because I ran out of lives and became demotivated. Watching content in another language has more than proven that it doesn't work for me (although curiously, with this I accidentally picked up a bit of Catalan base... but that's because it's a language similar to my native language). That's why I wanted to ask you... is there anything that has worked for you when learning languages?

I have more than 5 years left to leave, so my concern is not the biggest nor is it the most priority, but I know that German is a difficult language to learn and English has always been difficult for me.

I don’t entirely know why I do it, I think it’s because I like the deep pressure, and it calms me without being as violent as if I was doing a self injurious behavior. In the past when I’ve given these types of hugs, my mom has told me to never be that violent towards others or my kids. Obviously I don’t plan to, but these squeeze type hugs are so comforting to me, and hopefully provide comfort to others around me. My friends and teammates don’t seem to mind it, I think they appreciate that I am so sensitive towards them? Is it too much though? I never intend on being aggressive but I think it is a good alternative to being violent towards myself. ",1755037403.0,6,2,autism,autism

1moxu17,Help with my nephew’s violent episodes,"My nephew has autism, and likely OCD. 
He is very sweet, gentle, and docile 60% of the time. 35% of the time he is agitated and rattles through his obsessions in an echolalia kind of way, or asks questions to quell his overactive, worried mind: what if it rains? What if Covid comes back? What if (insert 27 other worries). He needs reassurance on these things, so we have to tell him it’s not raining, Covid isn’t coming back (a lie, but easier this way), etc. 

5% of the time he is violent, and occasionally to an extreme degree. It’s that 5% that is the problem. He has hospitalized his father a couple times with heatbutts to the eye or nose. He has destroyed 10s of thousands of dollars in property. He has smashed holes into walls of our house with his head, causing himself headaches (and I worry, mini concussions). He has shattered countless windows with all sorts of things— a rolling pin, a guitar, a picture frame— and in some instances sliced his hand open in the process. He has dragged his grandmother across the floor by the hair, ripping out whole chunks of it. He will also pull his pants down when he’s in these meltdowns and pee on the bed, flash his genitals in public, shout profanities in a strangers’ face. He has gotten so uncontrollably violent in these moments that no one is able to restrain him (he is a strong 19 year old, 6 feet tall), and we have had no other choice but to call the police —the cops have been to the house at least 20 times. They are good at deescalating actually — but even in front of them he has rampaged through the house destroying everything near him. He has been 5150d a dozen times (involuntarily held at hospital) during these rages. 

He was abandoned by his mother at age 8, over 10 years ago. My brother has raised him as a single parent, but he also manages bipolar disorder, and the task of parenting my nephew, which would be hard for any parent, is enormously difficult for him. He does his best, and it’s a lot, and I respect him for how hard he’s tried and how much patience he exhibits with my nephew. 

My nephew is on Seroquel, Xanax, and CBD. He eats whatever he wants, often consisting of not the healthiest choices. This is a difficult one to change, because one of his obsessions is food, and he probably has some kind of eating disorder.

It has gotten to the point where he is such a danger to his grandma that the family is considering looking for residential placement, though no one wants this to happen. 

We are all entirely at a loss for what to do or how to help him. His father is also difficult to engage with when it comes to ideas of things that may help. A part of me gets it — it’s his son, and he has the right to make decisions regarding his well being. It’s also frustrating that any suggestion the rest of us make is shot down as overstepping, or a judgement of his parenting, and so we are not invited into a space of helping, and my brother can become so combative, we have stopped trying as much. 

However, we need help. My nephew needs help. The family is drowning and I am at a loss. Any advice would be appreciated.

1mootla,Just venting and desperately looking for ppl to relate so I don't feel alone,"Im sorry im not diagnosed, the best I can give u is that my psychologist says I fit the criteria but Autism is too complex to know unless I see a specialist which is too expensive. And I completely agree with her, therefore would never self diagnose, but I still chose to come here, because even if I'm not autistic, I think I'm more likely to find ppl who would relate to my distress rn.

There's so much more to the story than the SS, but basically ive been working since I was 15, trying to earn enough for rent, and now that im finally here, at 22 (which is alr too late..) my boss advised me that if i save another 15-20 months, I could buy, instead of trapping myself in the renting world. I know that my future self will be better off like that, and my future self is unfortunately right now. But I'm still stuck in the past. Its so hard to dedicate and strictly save for that amount of time, down to the dollar, and partly gamble that I even manage to save it in that time, for my future, while sacrificing my childhood self.

I have lost all my hobbies because my Dad never let me keep a hobby without getting angry that ""its all u ever do"" no matter how much I worked or did my school work (homeschooled, so i was also isolated in this situation) so now I struggle to do any of my previous hobbies. I still haven't finished a book, I still haven't played the games i wanted to play, I don't eat properly, cant shower properly, sleep properly, live properly, or do anything i want, because I'm always so tense and anxious in this cluttered household of 7 other loud people. I have no personal space. Even my clothes r in my parents room so I often cant get to them in the morning.

Theres no order, there's no peace, im going crazy, all my cats die because im not allowed to take them to the vet, or keep them indoors, but they keep buying me more cats that I dont want to watch die. I love my current cat so dearly, im so afraid i won't be able to get her out in time.

My Dad is controlling, emotionally and financially abusive (previously physically) and to be comfortable and secure at least in 15 months saving, id need to have an extra 15-20k more by the end than i will actually have, if i save every penny. I would need to work 7 days a week for the next 12 months to be out before December (summer) 2027. 24 is the last good number I have left in my life. Since 19, my only other good numbers are 23 and 24, and im afraid to waste them, plus I hate winter, so rlly wanna be out b4 summer so I can experience 23yo me summer, so I get some good things. 

But either way, even now, i feel like im too old to relive this childhood i lost, or even start my life.

1mo03bv,Turns out there’s a good reason I can’t get through a day without napping,"Ever since I can remember, I’ve been someone who loves naps. Not the “oh, I feel a bit sleepy, maybe I’ll rest” kind, but the overwhelming, can-barely-keep-my-eyes-open, “if you don’t lie down now you might actually collapse” kind.

By the time I hit my early twenties, it became almost impossible to ignore. What confused me most was how unpredictable it seemed. This intense afternoon sleepiness had nothing to do with how much sleep I’d gotten the night before, or how physically active I’d been that day. I could sleep a full eight hours, eat well, have a calm morning… and still hit a wall around midday where staying awake felt like an uphill battle.

It wasn’t until I got my autism diagnosis in my late twenties (after a long, drawn-out process) that the pieces started falling into place. So much of my life suddenly made sense. 

That constant exhaustion? It wasn’t laziness, and it wasn’t bad sleep habits. It was the sheer amount of energy I’d been unknowingly pouring into simply existing in a world designed for neurotypical people.

For me, it’s not the obvious stuff that drains me most. It’s the “invisible” things neurotypical people barely register. Sitting in a meeting and parsing everyone’s tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language while trying to follow the actual content. Navigating a busy store. Having a day full of new or unpredictable events. Every little sensory input, social nuance, and environmental change adds to the mental load. And by the middle of the day, my brain is just done.

When I take a “nap,” it’s often not even about sleep. Sometimes I do fall asleep, but other times I just lie down with earplugs and an eye mask, shutting out every possible sensory input so my brain can finally, finally stop processing for a bit. It’s less about resting my body, and more about giving my mind a chance to reset,  like pressing “pause” on the constant stream of data I’ve been decoding since I woke up.

Learning this has been liberating. I no longer see my naps as a weird, unexplainable quirk or a sign of being “weak” or ""lazy"". They’re an essential tool for managing my energy as an autistic person. They’re my way of keeping myself functional in a world that often demands more processing power than my brain can sustainably give without breaks.

1moqiuo,My Safe Foods and FODMAPs conflict.,"I recently visited a Gastroenterologist and was once again recommended the FODMAP diet.

The problem is that I can’t just switch my diet around like a Neurotypical. Most of my Safe Foods are high in FODMAPs and most of the low FODMAP foods are ones I hate.

I can’t just swap my apples, peaches, and mangos for blueberries, melon, and bananas. Eating one of those would ruin my entire week. And forget about Coconuts. I can’t even tolerate the **smell** of those stupid bowling balls.

Most of my protein comes from cow milk yogurt and cheese, soy beans, and pistachios. I have a low FODMAP protein powder but it’s *barely* acceptable and expensive AF. I have tried chickpeas and beans but I can barely stomach them. There’s a lot of bread in my diet too.

I want to try my best to follow the diet but it’s time consuming and expensive. I want to exist without the constant belly pains but I have to eat something.

1mosyrx,Is night-shift factory work good for my type of Autism?,"Bit of a rant but here goes.

I hate hate hate work that involves catering to the whims of a manager. I've mainly worked in data processing, and the cycle goes like this:

The manager gives me a task. I ask how they'd like it done, they give a vauge answer. I do the task to the best of my ability, but because I didn't meet the vauge specifications, they get mad. I've had managers ask for some wild shit that couldn't be done by a team of people, let alone me, a single individual.

I just find it so unbelievably frustrating when people don't communicate clearly. I know that no human is 100% clear all the time, but my Autism seems to make it impossible to pick up on what managers are implying when they want stuff.

Now, a few years ago I worked in a factory, night shift. It wasn't a magical experience, there was a lot of boredom and pain, plenty of dreading going to work. But the more I look back on it, the more I see the positives.

I had clear goals every day: make X product at Y quality for Z hours. There wasn't anything to guess at or interpret. I made mistakes, sure, and I had to have things explained to me, but I learned and didn't repeat those mistakes. I could listen to music and podcasts and audiobooks or just let my mind think about things and keep working.

1mosjfy,Questions about jacksepticeye diagnosis,"I want to preface by clarifying that this post isn't meant to scrutinize the results or nature of jacksepticeye's ASD diagnosis, nor is it at all to ask if I'm autistic. Rather, I want to ask people about similar (or very different) experiences they might have. I find his diagnosis credible and my intent is not at all to question its reality.

For people who don't know him, jacksepticeye is a Youtuber who's been posting for at least a decade now, mostly gaming videos. He's kinda grouped in with the Pewdiepie/Markiplier generation of Youtube when gaming was one of its most popular genres. I (20F) grew up watching him and he was my favorite Youtuber by far around when I was 10, and I always thought I was kind of like him (not in the parasocial way... just that I was known as a loud, high-energy kid and liked video games).

I kinda fell off with watching him as I got older and at some point I hadn't seen one of his videos in a long long time. But he recently got diagnosed with autism, which wasn't surprising to most of his viewers, and I watched his video and a podcast where he talked about his experiences. He talked about how he was diagnosed late, partly because people never associated his traits with autism - he's ""sociable"" and a ""good communicator,"" and he acts ""normal,"" which contrasts common beliefs about what autism is. With each experience and habit he described, I always had the thought of ""that's just like me,"" like when I was a kid.

I've suspected in the past that I'm autistic, but I've usually come to the general conclusion of ""probably not."" I figured that I'm just part of the tiktok generation that's just discovering what autism is. But hearing jacksepticeye talk about his ""form"" of autism made me more aware about how it manifests differently across people. It confuses me, because the actual expert/diagnostic criteria portrays a very specific image to me of autism that differs from what jacksepticeye and other autistic figures describe - which isnt to discount their experiences, but just express curiosity. I think I just want to understand how wide the spectrum really is, and if this certain expression of autism is very relatable to many autistic folks.

SO I just want to ask for anybody who is autistic and knows jacksepticeye (or not, even) - do you have similar experiences to him about being able to mask really ""well"" or having potential symptoms overlooked? Is anyone else also known generally as a ""good communicator"" but maybe struggles internally in thinking about or fixating on social situations? I just want to hear about anything people might relate to in his discussions.

Tl;dr - jacksepticeye is autistic, no im not asking if/saying that im autistic, no im not asking people to define what autism is, just want to talk to people who are diagnosed if they resonate with his experiences.

for reference im 19F, late diagnosed, and I’ve got autism, ADHD (educational diagnosis) OCD, and likely some form of cPTSD

but my problem is my imposter syndrome is disgustingly high and getting diagnosed didn’t help at all because i was already 100% sure by the time i got an assessment, and all the diagnosis did for me was confirm it. sure it helped to have it on paper for explanation purposes etc, but it still didn’t help me mentally

so long story short my mums the only grown up in the house and when i told her she literally laughed because “im probably fine” and “just shy” ya know the usual dismissive stuff. but now its been months since the diagnosis and she still cracks jokes like “see you’re ok!” whenever i push through my discomfort to do things like wash the dishes and go outside to do errands on short notice. she’s “chill” about it and “accepts” it but the snide comments fuck with my mind. id rather outright dismissal than whatever tf she does to me. anyway its annoying but i can handle it, only issue is idk how im supposed to get rid of my imposter syndrome while living in that kind of environment 

the worst part is when i see/meet people who talk about their imposter syndrome and i feel so seen for a second, and then i notice that they are literally trademark autistic/ADHD and all that does it make me feel worse about myself and that if they feel like a fake i SURELY must be faking. like sure i struggle with things NTs would find easy, but I can still do it all everyday. just means i sometimes cry a little at night 🥹

Lately I’ve been trying to read and watch everything I can on the topic to start figuring out which of my traits are actually related to autism (and oh my god, it’s such a mind-blowing relief when all the puzzle pieces finally click, all those things that people tried to explain with OCD, avoidant personality disorder, and other stuff, but never quite fit the full criteria, turned out to be ASD all along).

So, my question is this: are imaginary conversations considered a common trait of ASD?

My daughter was crying, and I overheard new RBT repetitively say, “What’s wrong with you? Why do you keep crying?” in a tone that sounded irritated and harsh — not calm, supportive, or even neutral.

Later, when my daughter tried to peek into her bag, new RBT called her a “nosey little girl” in the same annoyed tone. I realize some people might think that’s harmless, but the tone again felt dismissive and not the respectful approach my daughter’s other RBTs have taken.

Very early on, new RBT asked the BCBA and later me how involved I am during sessions which I found odd since that’s already been discussed and agreed upon with the BCBA. We established early on that my involvement during sessions is limited unless my daughter is really upset or I need to check in, and it’s worked fine for us.

The way she brought it up made me feel judged since I had gone out a few times to check on my daughter when she was crying. I also felt uneasy bc she kept mentioning how other parents interfere with therapy and it’s better for them to stay away and trust the therapist knows what they’re doing. This is the first time I’ve ever heard a rbt question whether or not I’ll be popping in and seemingly have an issue with it.

She also seemed unusually focused on how much my daughter can verbally communicate, rather than working with her current communication tools and strengths. That was another red flag for me. She was very adamant about knowing if she could vocal sentences. This also made me feel uneasy bc first she is concerned I’ll be popping into sessions and is trying to figure out exactly what my daughter is able to verbalize. Maybe I’m overly anxious but that makes me think she’ll be doing things in unconventional and maybe even harmful ways.

Before she left, she told me to expect Friday to “not be a good day” because she’s planning to “really push” my daughter to see how many targets she can complete. Knowing my kid, that’s a surefire way to make her shut down, especially when they barely know each other yet. The BCBA also told the new RBT that my daughter is stubborn and will shutdown if pushed too far.

All of this combined left me feeling uncomfortable enough that I told my husband I don’t even want to leave my daughter alone with new RBT. I’m actually considering putting up cameras, which is saying a lot because I’ve never felt this level of distrust with her previous RBTs.

Am I overreacting by requesting a new RBT after just one session?",1755063005.0,1,7,autism,autism

1moltaa,So my online girlfriend broke up with me because I don’t know how to treat her more than a friend,"So basically my online girlfriend of a couple of months broke up with me and I feel horrible about it and how I made her feel I feel really guilty about everything and all I want to do is just infinitely apologise but that isn’t a proper apology 

So basically I never liked the idea of an online relationship and used to make fun of them until my online best friend of a year and half confessed to me over and hour of convincing her that whatever secret she wanted to say would be fine with me no matter what and eventually she said “well basically I love you” and I had liked her too for the past few months but thought I was crazy but I regret saying I liked her too not because I don’t like her because I still do but because I hurt her emotionally and I’ve never been good with girls so I was very surprised she said this and she always sent me snaps of her face which lwk made me blush very hard bc I think she’s pretty and I’m a pretty chopped guy and eventually after a week of begging me I sent her my face and she surprisingly said I was cute but I’m going to get into today and acknowledge what I did wrong i just need to do this even if people don’t care or just look over it and if they do I honestly don’t blame you, basically her message starts off with me being insecure and autistic which she was always okay with or atleast said she was I don’t actually think she was because this is why I never managed to make it feel real, and she said I always used it as an excuse to make things about myself which I 100% did do without realising and I regret, I insulted her asking if she had dementia whenever she forgot something ( she did insult me a lot too I will say and she did often call me a r*tard ) and apparently that made her cry which I feel awful about I have a terrible  thing for insulting people thinking it’s only a joke because where I’m from it is which doesn’t justify it it just delusions me further and makes me a worse person, I never asked how she was feeling because I was always too shy to ask which made her feel like she couldn’t tell me all of this sooner, whenever she said something I would start an argument about It which is true a lot recently although she did this too ( not trying to justify anything just explain ) whenever she vented to me about shit I never knew how to respond which I did say while doing that and I really feel bad for that one since I don’t know how to talk well even over text, she had previously been suicidal the past few years as her school hates her and she is often ignored by her friends or parents  and I made that even worse and that’s what I feel by far worst about like I can’t describe how bad I feel like I just feel awful I made it all about me and made her feel worthless, I never even complimented her or said I loved her all because I’m too shy and insecure I just feel awful and she said I can’t reverse the damage nomatter how much I apologise but that we can stay friends, 

I did write her an apology about the same length of this and acknowledged that if she needed space or wanted to unfriend or block me she could and that I would respect that and never contact her again even in my apology I feel like I made it about me I didn’t but I feel like I did I need some advice here of what to do going forward as I feel awful and I’m moving on fast i just feel really bad and part of me wishes she could see this but I’m not going to show her if anyone can give help on how I can show love or respond better to venting or anything that possibly could have made the situation better so I can learn from my mistakes please help and if you read this much thank you this shit is so long lol",1755034615.0,4,1,autism,autism

1momxao,How do I ask for help?,"I am late diagnosed Audhd and with giftedness and I have a really strong impulse to self isolate. I finally got diagnosed after I basically found that I have isolated myself away from all relationships including my family, spending long gaps of time with no communication where friends just give up on reaching out over time. 

I don’t want to be a burden while also being hyper-aware of people’s capacities or current stress which causes distortions so I also avoid being vulnerable to spare being projected onto and misunderstood. Being understood feels extremely important and o tend to over-explain and over-share. When I am not in crisis I tend to explain in very honest and lucid ways which seem to confuse people because I am not screaming or emotionally expressing the struggle. 

I recognize that this pattern leads me to feeling frustrated and resentful from habitually expecting people to understand the severity of my challenges and know how to show up to help while I isolate and don’t ask for help. I have been noticing that even when I think I am asking for help I am not being clear enough which I suspect may be because of alexythimia because when I am in crisis I am overwhelmed and confused so I don’t know what I need and thus cannot ask for specific supports. 

Since my diagnosis I have been experiencing a lot of skill regression and heightened sensitivity and have been learning about my sensory needs, executive dysfunction and emotional regulation issues (etc) through trial and error but still feel very helpless as I continue on this non-linear journey of self discovery. It feels incredibly daunting to feel my struggles worsen as I simultaneously learn more about myself and become more aware of my neurodivergence. 

So I am curious if anyone feels this way and how they have learned to 1) know what you need and 2) ask for help.

1momhe3,Doctor Who (pt4),"In this Doctor's first story, he fights against a giant robot. He also, really likes jelly babies now, and offers them to everyone. Even rude people. He of course, defeats the robot.

Eventually, in The Genesis of the Daleks, we learn about Davros. Basically, the Time Lords have sent the Doctor and his companions, Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan, into the past, to prevent the Daleks from ever being created. The Doctor ultimately doesn't.  Sarah Jane: Well, what are you waiting for?!

The Doctor: Just touch these two strands together, and the Daleks are finished... Have I that right?

Sarah Jane: To destroy the Daleks? You can't doubt it!

The Doctor: But I do! You see, some things could be better with the Daleks. Many future worlds will become allies because of the fear of the Daleks.

Sarah Jane: It isn't like that!

The Doctor: Well, the final responsibility is mine. And mine alone. You see, if someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you and told you that that child would grow up totally evil to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives... could you then kill that child?

Sarah Jane: [pause] We're talking about the Daleks, the most evil creatures ever invented. You must destroy them! You must complete your mission for the Time Lords!

The Doctor: Do I have the right? Simply touch one wire against the other, and it's it? The Daleks cease to exist? Hundreds of millions of people, thousands of generations, can live without fear, in peace, and never even know the word ""Dalek""?

Sarah Jane: Then why wait? If it was a disease or some sort of bacteria you were destroying, you wouldn't even hesitate!

The Doctor: But if I kill, wipe out a whole intelligent life form, then I'd become like them. I'd be no better than the Daleks.

Sarah Jane: Think of all the suffering there'll be if you don't do it!

I'm gonna skip over a few things, and we now get to Romana. Another Time Lord, but I guess you could call her a Time Lady. But before her, the Doctor met k-9, a robot dog, and Leela. Leela left on Gallifrey, because she fell in love with a Time Lord.

I should probably mention that the Master first appeared in the 3rd Doctor's era, and was s big baddie, and still is. I think you can guess he's also a Time Lord. And the sonic screwdriver, first appeared in the 2nd Doctor's era.

It's the end of the universe, and the Master and Doctor, team up to prevent the universe from being, over entropyified? But, the Master betrays the Doctor, because of course he did, and the Doctor ends up falling to his death, where he would then regerate into the 5th Doctor, played by Peter Davidson. And, he also now has Nyssa, Tegan, and Adric as companions. Out of those 3, only 1 comes from Earth. Can you guess who that is?",1755036197.0,3,3,autism,autism

1moetk7,Always needing to yield to others when walking?,"I've dealt with this for a while, but just recently wondered if it was an autistic thing.

I like going for walks, and I walk in a local park quite often. Sometimes, the path is a bit narrow. I've had it happen many times that two people will be walking side-by-side coming the other way. I'll be as far over on my side as I feel like I can reasonably be, but I'll still have to turn my body sideways to avoid colliding with them. They never turn theirs. I would *think* that if you're walking two across, and you're passing a single person walking on the edge of the path, and there's not room, that one of the two in the pair would walk behind the other for a second so everyone can pass. (At least, that's what I do when I'm walking with someone.)

I'm a 6' man, and often times it's women smaller than me that do this. I feel like I *have* to move because a 6' man running into a smaller person is not going to be viewed kindly (and I really don't have any interest in colliding with someone or getting into a pissing contest to see who's *not* going to yield, anyway).

The other day this happened, and I was walking on the edge of a sidewalk that is directly against the road. I had to go fully sideways to not step off the sidewalk into the road, and into any potential oncoming traffic, and I didn't feel safe doing that. There was plenty of room for both of them to walk side-by-side and give me room if they had just moved over a bit.

One last example, and this one really pissed me off. I was at the beach a couple years ago, walking through an alley way that led to the boardwalk. I was with my wife and our young, autistic son. We were pretty close to a wall on our right, and a large family was coming the other way. They had a good 20 feet of open space on the other side of them, but insisted on walking very close to us (coming the opposite way). I didn't want to move away from my son, because I was holding his hand so he could feel safe, and so we could feel that he was safe. There was an older lady (not super old, but older than me) in their family that was clearly going to run into me. I didn't move. I didn't want to bump into her, but I didn't want to let go of my son's hand, either. She stopped, turned around, and demanded that I apologize. Meanwhile, I thought her whole family might jump us. I apologized just to get her to go away, but it really pissed me off.

Anyway, does anyone else deal with this? Am I just really missing some cues here? Or do I just happen to find the assholes? (I mean, I know you can't *really* answer that without actually observing me, but still...)",1755019131.0,6,3,autism,autism

I’ve always had trouble socializing but now it feels like I’m past the point of No return.

I don’t have any friends and it’s starting to get to me again. I’m 21 and I’ve been basically friendless since I turned 15, with random short term friendships in between that always ended badly. I’ve only ever been able to make friends in the mental hospital because that’s the only place I’ve been that has other people my age or people that can relate to me. 
I can’t work or attend school because my anxiety is so bad that I faint. I take meds for it but as of now I can’t manage it. I’m doing TMS in hopes of improving those symptoms but I’m not gonna hold my breath.
I don’t drive for the same reason. So even if I had a place to go for meetups, I don’t think I’d be able to handle being there. 

Sometimes people interact with me irl and I just don’t know what to do. We have a small chat and then what? If I ask if they want to be friends they get weirded out. They say I’m too desperate or coming off as creepy. I don’t know how to organically communicate with others. If I don’t do anything we both just walk away and never talk again, but if I try to advance things I look like a weirdo.

I can’t even make online friends. I get chats and I find people that have stuff in common with me but nobody feels like a true friend. Everyone feels like a brick wall or just words on a screen and no matter what I do, that doesn’t change.
It wasn’t always this way. I met my ex online by happenstance and we hit it off immediately. but ever since then I haven’t been able to feel a damn thing for anyone. I don’t feel like these people are my friends but we talk daily and often.
Am I broken? What’s wrong with me?

Anybody else struggle with periodical bouts of insomnia?

Ever since I was a teenager I’ve had periods lasting from 1 week to upwards of 10 weeks where I just can’t get to sleep at regular hours. Doesn’t matter if I have a regular work schedule, go to the gym, go to bed at a consistent time and do all the sleep hygiene stuff, my body just decides 3-4 times a year that it’s not gonna fall asleep until it has to from exhaustion. And even when I manage to fall asleep on time during these periods my body can just decide after 2 hours to go “haha, that’s enough sleep for you, time to wake up and not be able to fall asleep for the rest of the night”. Which of course mess up my day/night cycle, as I eventually fall asleep from exhaustion in the morning/at noon (or I have to power through until the afternoon when I have a job). And even then there’s no guarantee I stay asleep for more than for a couple of hours again.

I just turn into a zombie during these periods, and while I used to try and fight it in the past, I’ve just kinda submitted myself to the fact that this is how my body is, as the anxiety and stress I’d get over trying to fall asleep only made it worse.

Is this something that could be autism related? I know sleep issues are common for both people with autism and ADHD, but I don’t know if it can cause it to be this bad?

Bare with me as I untangle this mess in my brain. For context of my life:

I work a customer service facing job at an office supply store. It is a big, bright building with decent crowds with back to school season coming up and it means a lot of time with these bright lights, multi tasking, and maintaining customer service and that’s really difficult as is because I’m not extroverted but “masked me” is super out going as I can make good conversation and will talk to my coworkers a lot. It is the same way with friends I’ve known for years, being out going, talking a lot, and usually full of energy. The other day, I was more quiet and wasn’t talking as much and my coworkers were very quick to ask me what was going on, but the truth was, nothing was going on, it was just I was in my own head and thinking about my special interests, but it wasn’t the first time someone has asked me if I’m okay because I was quiet- coworkers in the past, friends, and even my fiance has asked this too. 

I don’t really like to tell people I’m autistic in fear of judgement, but my friends and fiance know I’m autistic and it makes me wonder if I’ve made my entire identity the “masked me” because the second I start being me (mono tone voice, special interest mode, needing headphones for louder places), I feel… embarrassed even though it’s who I am and I can’t change that, but it’s the fact I’ve become so “low needs” that people and even myself have forgotten that I am autistic. But how do you guys do it? How do you accept yourself and let yourself unmask more?

Also i am not going to tell him this anytime soon. of course.

Tonight is the first night he landed in my city and with delay and the new scenery I knew it would be rough for him, and he is really apologetic too.

I am not angry or stressed out about any of this, but he is physically sick(chronically ill) on top of his autism, and he had 3 crying meltdowns and insomnia completely even with two doses of his prescribed drug. It’s just not very safe or healthy for him to go on trip especially that he cannot apply for insurance anymore from his numerous diagnosis.

He talked to me about wanting to save up for a trip I can go with him to asia one day, and he made me promise before. (He traveled a lot before he became disabled from his physical illness, and before he visited me, he usually explains to me he is very used to the process of travel. That’s why I promised him.)

I know how serious a promise is taken by autism in general, but this is such a sensitive issue I already know telling him directly will only cause his meltdown.

Please any advice if possible, thank you very much. I want the best for him and that involves talking about one of the most sensitive issue for him in the least upsetting way.",1755034328.0,2,6,autism,autism

1mop0q8,Understanding Special Education Placement and Moving to General Education?,"When our child was 18 months old, he was speaking fewer than 50 words. Our pediatrician recommended that we schedule appointments with both a speech therapist and a pediatric developmental specialist. By the time we saw the speech therapist, his vocabulary had already increased. The therapist explained that, for his age, his speech was within the normal range, so there was no immediate cause for concern.

During the developmental evaluation, we learned that he was behind on some milestones, and he was diagnosed with autism. Over the past year, he has received an IEP through the regional school and started ABA therapy, which has helped him make significant progress. He is now speaking, communicating his needs, and generally doing well for his age while continuing to improve.

Recently, the school recommended placing him in a special education program. We are open to this option during these early years, especially since the smaller class size could help him adjust. However, I’ve heard from some parents that once a child begins receiving special education services, it can be difficult to transition them back into a general education classroom, as decisions often depend on ongoing evaluations and district policies. I’m not sure how accurate that is, but it’s something I’d like to understand better. At times, I have felt that the school may be strongly encouraging special education placement, though I recognize they may be seeing things from a professional perspective that we do not observe at home.

I would appreciate hearing from parents whose children have received special education services about how the process typically works. The school mentioned that we can request an independent evaluation, which is fine with us. Our main question is whether, at some point, we as parents can request that our child try a general education classroom to see how he does, or if the decision is entirely based on the school’s evaluations.

For context, we are based in the Bay Area, California.",1755042538.0,0,2,autism,autism

He is not able to say why he’s mad, but he is able to say “mad”. He is 15, and was a very happy, chill guy up u til about a year and a half ago.

When he is mad, he does something so we will “yell” at him, then he runs around telling g, swipes things off of the table to make a crash sound, and throws himself to the hard floor. He often gets cut up and bruises when he does this. 
I know it sounds like I’m just saying he wants me to yell, but I’m not kidding. He will actually say “go to your room” and put my hand in his back to get me to push him towards his room. Or he will put his hand next to a hot stove and look at me so I’ll tell him to stop. Put his foot up on the dining  table and look at me and say “ put your foot down” because he wants me to say it. I have tried NOT saying it, but things get much worse if I don’t . 
When he starts to get mad, (before the the throwing) he starts sweating and his heart beats very hard. We were at the doctor once during this and she put him on a  blood pressure medicine, thinking he was in flight or flight. We haven’t seen a  difference.
Recently we tried ignoring the behavior, but he stood outside waiting for us to yell him for 2 hours. He wouldn’t budge until we finished the routine. When he’s done, he says he’s sorry and falls asleep.

1mon91m,Kpop Demon Hunters,"Before i get flamed in the comments, I am making this post in order to gain so understanding as to why this movie is apparently so good and what i might have missed or misunderstood. I will also try to stick to the issue that is actually relevant to this subreddit and how this movie related to me… in all the wrong ways.

Spoiler warning of course. Firstly one of the main things this movie goes over is being different, especially in a way that others will see negatively. It also goes over keeping secrets relating to differences and accepting those with differences. It could very well relate to having disabilities such as autism and much more.

I related to these things a lot, having autism is something that people at my school saw as negative for most of my years there. It also related to me being queer and not being accepted by one of my best friends for it (que the Rumi’s demon side reveal to Zoe and Mira but without a true resolution at the end, a sort of awkward topic that my friend tries to keep out). The fact that Rumi was scared to reveal her secret made perfect sense to me! Especially since it was her friend’s job to kill people like her. Now i can excuse the original surprise from her friends, even them walking away to process. But then they drew their weapons on her and that. Hurt. I have never been truly accepted by people who reacted badly toward one of my differences or issues at first. They never got over it and i just lost them as a friend or something similar. So this scene felt super wrong.

Essay break: am i the only one who felt my senses were being assaulted by the high notes in the music and the animation style? No shame on the movie, its a me issue, but still. 
Obviously movies often represent what should be but isn’t. Yet this acceptance of Rumi after an original aggressive reaction to her secret left me with a complete lack of trust of Zoe and Mira instead of admiration for their acceptance. Im sure it has to do with previous trauma and my current “being queer vs my friend” issue. It bothers me that the movie sets me off in so many ways and i want to figure out why and how to go around it since- its not just a movie in this case and in fact probably a trauma issue in me.

Any similar thoughts or opposing points? This essay is probably quite convoluted so i apologize.

I love that quote, as it seems to describe me, at least to a point.

Older AuDH (whatever, just call me neurospecial) here.

I noticed these last days that I seem to have some sort of a situation where I seem to experience a certain type of ""lag"" with regard to my environment, and with that I guess I mostly mean my social environment, like the people around me and what they are going on about.

I assume this has something to do with my neuroweird brain. I'm not really sure what to make of this ""realization"", if that is even what this is, but it seems like at least a form of explanation for why I appear to be ""out of it"" or ""in my own world"" so often. I feel like I function on a slightly different time scale than others. In some ways super fast, but socially, somehow, kinda slow.

If anyone has any ideas of how to follow up on this, please tell me. Am I processing too much stuff on the side?

I mean I also constantly lose the thread, so to speak, and get sidetracked by either my own brain, or some random background conversation or movement or whatever, and completely forget whatever the person I had been trying to follow/communicate with was saying.

Is this an emotional processing thing? Just a bit clueless here, trying to learn more about myself and how to deal with the world more effectively. And not appearing to both myself and others like a complete idiot.

the really scary part is when I ingest certain stimulants, I feel like this handicap disappears, at least for a short time, but that's not really a sustainable solution. blagh.

It's huge and was written by a neuropsychologist who has worked in the field for 20 years, in addition to having followed six months of tests and interviews with my mothers. Even after all this, I still doubt him. I would like to know if anyone else has felt this way? And how did you overcome it? I would like to see a psychologist, but unfortunately I don't have the money and all the psychologists I've had so far haven't been very good. One of them even made me think about it. He said he doesn't think I'm autistic because I don't look autistic, I can maintain eye contact, and he said things like that. Thanks and sorry if it was a stupid question, but I needed to talk to someone. Also, sorry for the bad English on Google Translate, English is not my main language...

1mogd4r,Medication Recommendations,Hi! I got diagnosed with autism a year ago at 23. I have been taking psych meds since I was in the third grade. I’ve tried at least 20 different antidepressants. Before I was diagnosed I was a candidate for ECT. I tired ketamine therapy instead and it absolutely saved my life. After I was diagnosed my therapist suggested I try Abilify and it really helped me. I can’t describe exactly what it does but I feel less overwhelmed all the time. I’m really struggling with severe burnout and depression right now and feel worse than when I was considering ECT. It feels like the ketamine has stopped working for the depression symptoms. I tried a higher dose of Abilify and that did nothing. A nurse practitioner suggested I try Vrylar or Rexalti instead. She also said I could try Fluvoxamine. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist soon and was wondering if anyone has any experience with any of these meds or other recommendations. I understand autism cannot be “cured” and would never want that- I’m just looking for things that would help me manage my depression and anxiety. Thanks! ,1755022476.0,2,2,autism,autism

I’ve just had a really bad meltdown and idk if she’s gonna hate me forever, she doesn’t know I’m autistic and I tried to explain how everything is so overwhelming but I don’t think she gets it. 

It’s incredibly hot today (I hate summer in the UK) and I know for a fact I’m going to be so overstimulated going out in this heat and socialising. First I have to get the train to go meet her during rush hour, I struggle with rush hour as it is and with the humidity and heat on top of it I know it’s going to be too much. I feel like I’m having a panic attack just thinking about it.

They're always kinda, considerate but also harsh and real when the situation demands it. 
I'm struggling to be like this too however. I find when I stop filtering super heavily and being hyper vigilant, I tend to say or do things I find either annoying or sometimes just mean--which I almost always immediately regret. They don't seem to see it that way but I don't like my behaviour.

I was hoping to hear other people's experiences. I pretty regularly experience autistic burnout--I had a particularly bad episode not long ago that was bad enough I considered if it might be depression. I know masking was a key contributor to that but I don't want to unmask if it means being someone I can't stand. Is this something that'll iron itself out over time, do I just need to try and be more aware of what I'm saying? I just want some perspective 🙏.",1755015265.0,2,4,autism,autism

He eats just about whatever he wants which more often than not are ""unhealthy"" foods that are high in fat and sugar. We have tried explaining to him the importance of a healthy balanced diet and exercise but it feels like he is not internalising the information. He is not motivated to exercise and we have in the past tried to ""bribe"" him by rewarding him with money for every lap he runs around our neighbourhood, or if he loses a certain amount of weight, but it appears to have failed. The only thing he has remote interest in is swimming as he used to swim competitively in a swim club but has retired since 2020 (his weight started going up from this point on). Parents try to bring him out to exercise whenever they are free but they are usually busy working and it also depends on his mood (if he doesn't feel like it he's not doing it). We have previously encouraged him to swim at public swimming complexes but he prefers to either swim at sea in the evenings/night (unsafe as there are no lifeguards on duty), or illegally trespassing into condominiums or houses with swimming pools to swim.

It all began a few months ago when out of nowhere she broke down in public telling me I never make eye contact with her and she can’t “read me.” I was confused. She has brought up an emotional disconnect between us on many occasions and told me the happiest times for her are when I’m smiling or laughing because otherwise she can’t figure out what is going on with me and apparently this brings her a lot of stress? 

I noticed sometimes when I was telling her about things going on in my life she seems to sort of half invest/respond to the conversation- particularly about my job (i’m a software engineer). She also seems to not remember things as well as me. I can tell her something she said 2 months ago easily and she always is surprised.

Last night she asked me if there is any chance I could be autistic. This broke me because I don’t even want to think about it but some of the traits I have been reading online do match challenges I’ve had by myself / in our relationship. She has a “neurodivergent” sibling.

1moq7d9,Listening to people talk about masking burnout feels like listening to rich people complain about their problems,"I don’t really understand how masking works or what it means. I especially don’t understand what people mean when they say they want to “unmask.” I think I’m just not capable of it—I can’t recognize the rules well enough to even try to follow them. I could certainly never fake being NT. Everybody knows that there’s something wrong with me almost right away, from how I stand and move and talk and stare and a million other things. 

I’m pretty low to moderate support needs—I
can work, and I am in college, although I can’t live alone. I know I am very privileged compared to a lot of other autistic people. But being obviously autistic has still made my whole life harder. It makes people think I’m stupid and childish and incapable, that I don’t care about anything, that I’m rude and irresponsible. It’s cost me jobs and driven away potential friends and made me a target of manipulation and mistreatment. 

So to me, masking seems like a superpower: You can make people like you! You can make yourself be taken seriously! I can’t act “normal” at all. I wouldn’t know how to start.

I know that masking burnout is a serious problem for people who experience it, even if I don’t understand how, and I do feel bad for them. But to me it feels like hearing somebody say “people only want to be my friend because I have money” or “my vacation home burned down.” I feel sorry for you. I also would love the opportunity to have your problems. 

I don’t know. Anybody else relate at all? Does this just sound like I’m discounting other people’s problems?

1mo8mkd,Sound sensitivity dogs vs autistic humans,"Hello all, 

I am hoping someone here will know the answer to this: 

I have a service dog (Labrador male, 3yrs old) 

I have always been taught that dogs hearing is more sensitive than humans, so I’m always very careful not to expose him to loud noises because I know how bad they hurt me so I can’t imagine how it would feel for him. 
Yet when noise cannot be avoided (in the street for exemple) he seems to not mind at all while I have to grab my head and sometimes fold over in pain. 

So the questions are:

Can a dog hear more but bear more noise?
Or is my dog special?
Are autistic people more sensitive than dogs? 

Also I know my service dog can hear just fine because he will join me in the kitchen at a hint of the noise made by the wiggling of the metal part of the fruit peeler (the dog loves carrots and apples among many others) ",1755005004.0,2,4,autism,autism

I haven't been diagnosed but I just know that I'm different, you know""","So - I guess EVERYBODY is autistic? It's bizarre how this happens nearly every time, and they also always bring up ADHD. To them, I think it's more like ""oh, I feel awkward at parties sometimes, and I can't concentrate"", which to me sounds more like ""socially awkward with a short attention span"".

It promotes the ""everyone's a little autistic"" trope, which downplays the true miracles some of us pull just to get through a normal day. 

I'm curious - has anyone else noticed this trend? I'm thinking of starting to challenge these people, as their lazy self-diagnoses are more harmful than they realize.

1mob7rj,"Idk, kinda wanna yap about my life.","I've been officially diagnosed with autism for 9 years now. I've moved around twice in my life. I'm from Poland, but started living in Scotland ever since I turned one. Then at ten age I moved back to Poland and have lived there every since 1 day ago.

While I lived in Scotland, from my memory I remember being pretty social, yet still sometimes very anxious and introverted. There were a few times I had to present something publicly, and every single one of those times I would start just bawling in-front of the audience. There were also some other times. I vividly remember my first day in kindergarten, which was also my birthday, so the people there wanted to celebrate my birthday. They baked me a cake, and then sang happy birthday to me. I clearly did not like that as I was crying uncontrollably and begging for my mom, who promptly came and that was that of my first day in kindergarten.  
  
Despite all of the setbacks, I again think I was pretty social. I was friends with every single person in my class, very close friends with like half of them. Often times you could say I was the class clown. Everyone liked me (except 2 people I won't go into), and I liked everyone (again, not these 2 people). I was part of a swimming class and a taekwondo class (started them because my friends were there, quit once they quit though, also some anxious autistic kid activities during them).  
  
I turned 10, and due to some family circumstances I moved to Poland. I was super excited about moving to Poland, as I always came here during summer break and loved it. I was very close with my cousin, we would hang out for the entire month I was here. First day in Poland, there were some kids on bicycles. I'm not sure whether I approached them or they approached me, but we became best friends immediately. I'd hang out with them all day every day until school started. I was in the same class as one of the girls I hanged out with, but we didn't really speak that much in school, as she was fairly introverted, and ig I maybe was too, I'm not sure. We were still friends though, and we were perfectly fine striking up a conversation every once in a while.

Being a transfer in a school which almost never has transfers, and being best friends with the cousin I mentioned before, and him being one of the popular kids, immediately made me fairly popular. I'd hang out with them in school and after school. We would usually ride our bikes and go to a local pizza store. Slowly over time though, I started to become more and more introverted, and spoke with my friends less and less. The school I went to, would transfer you to a different school after you finished 4th grade. It was the exact same class with the same people. I don't remember the exact timeline of how I felt and acted. But I remember at some point, maybe in 6th grade or something, the teachers would start telling my classmates to hang out with me more, cause I always just sat alone in the hallways never talking to anyone, that didn't really work though. They'd come up to me, ask if I wanted to hang out, and I would decline. 

I was still friends with the same people, we would still ride our bikes and go to that pizza store, but it was far less frequent. Then covid happened, and I wouldn't talk to anyone then. There was a time I had my birthday, and one of my friends asked to hang out to celebrate it, I remember vividly everything that happened there, it was the first time I actually celebrated my birthday in Poland with my friends, previously it was really just with my family. Once we finally came back to school, I kept it up and didn't speak with anyone. I was about 1 or 2 years from graduating here, I kinda stopped caring about keeping my friendships or whatever cause I thought that they're gonna wither away soon anyways cause we'd all go to different highschool.

During this time I was a little bit depressed. There were times where I wouldn't shower for a month straight. A few days a month I would cry myself to sleep. And very rarely I kinda discussed suicide with myself (not seriously planning on killing myself, but just thinking what it would be like and what would happen).

In my final year I was basically completely a complete outcast. I forgot to mention, but I would regularly talk with one of my friends from Scotland. I was never really close with him when I lived there, but when I moved I remember him telling me that he cried all day cause I left, and then tried to find me through the internet until he messaged me on roblox, after that we would use skype to talk quite consistently, and eventually from someone I didn't talk to much before, he became my best friend (and still is). By the time the final exams were coming up, most people in the school would think I'm weird. I smelled really bad, as I didn't shower and would often wear the exact same clothes for weeks.   
  
Boom, I graduated with really good grades, 100% on everything except Polish (my Polish is genuinely dogshit, I still barely know Polish today). Then got accepted to one of the best schools in my district. I don't remember the exact reason, but my grandma (she's my parental guardian) decided for me not to go to the school I got into. I think it was cause she thought I would be studying history there, and I wanted to study IT. In that school I was studying IT though (In Poland you don't decide what subjects you want to study, but instead the school will have 5-10 groups, all of which have 3 different subjects you learn at a higher level. The school I got into had Math, English and IT. The one my grandma made me go to instead was Math English and Geography. I was kinda mad, but me being an autistic lil fella I never expressed my thoughts to other people, so I just accepted that I'm not gonna be studying IT which was my dream. Overall though, hated geography at first, but it kinda grew on me, I still like geography now).

School starts, and I didn't speak to literally anyone there. For the whole 4 years I had 0 close friends (later on there was this one girl, with whom I would talk to a few times a month. I think she just felt bad for me being all alone, and her being basically the super energetic and earnest girl, she would talk to me. Even later on I started playing volleyball, as it was something the school made me do due to my autism, which I'm really grateful for now, as it made me fall in love with volleball.

I was super depressed now, I would consistently think about ending my life. The only thing that made me not kill myself was the friend I made in Scotland, and later on, his friends and his friends friends. I still talk to all of them every single day. If not for that, I'm pretty much certain I would've killed myself. Through my whole life I had trouble doing basic stuff in public. I could never go to a store without straight up shitting myself, I could not drink water in public without shitting myself, I couldn't walk in public without shitting myself. Only in the last 2 years, did I develop the skill to walk in public without shitting myself, which was with great help from my therapist. I still struggle with going to the shops now to buy something, I have to hype myself up beforehand, but at least I'm able to go inside one now without shitting myself.

Eventually I graduate from highschool, and with my autism buff, I got perfect grades (except for Polish cause once again I do not know Polish, now that I think about it, it's probably just cause I didn't have any friends to speak Polish to). I kinda said fuck it, and said that I'll do my own thing. I decided I would study comp sci abroad. Again, I can barely go to a store without throwing up, and now I'm flying to a country I've never been to before, all alone.

I arrived here recently, and was so stressed that it took me 7h to fall asleep, and overall I slept for 2h (Usually it takes me only 2h to fall asleep. I've tried a bunch of sleeping medication, and nothing has worked so far). I felt like throwing up on the train to the airport, but once I arrived at the airport, idk I kinda just felt perfectly fine, really excited even. As far as I know, I wasn't stressed at all (I usually don't know what emotion I'm feeling, and the only indicator for me that I'm stressed is my stomach hurting or not taking like 4+ hours to fall asleep). I called a taxi to bring me to the airport and I was pretty excited once I got there. I even fucked up, and after going through the security checkpoint I realised I forgot to check in my bags, but unlike usually, I wasn't freaking out, I just kinda laughed at myself, thinking about how dumb I was.   
  
Eventually, I got on the plane, arrived in the Netherlands, and the first thing I do is go to a restaurant alone. I've never gone to a restaurant alone before and whenever I'd go, the person I went with would order the food for me as I was too scared to talk to the waiter. I said what food I got, and enjoyed it, all while not being stressed. Got on the train to the house I'll be living at, met with my landlord, had a pretty nice conversation with him, he kinda walked me through everything. Took a shower and went immediately to bed. Still not cured of my insomnia or whatever I have it took me 2h to fall asleep.|

Woke up in the morning, realised I don't have some stuff, so I went to a grocery store and bought the stuff I wanted. Was a little bit stressed out while there, but not anything like before. Got everything I wanted, and left. Later on my roommate came, who was on vacation in their own country. Had a pretty chill conversation with them. Didn't feel stressed at all, we both made some jokes and laughed, it just kinda flowed naturally.

Uni still hasn't started yet, but I'm very excited to go there and meet other people.

I don't know how I want to end this. Maybe this is just temporary adrenaline, but I don't think it is. Maybe it's cause now is the first time I actually feel like an adult, and not like a child where everyone else has to do stuff for me, I actually have to take responsibility for stuff, and do stuff on my own.

1mn956n,My bf has ruined my birthday but I don't want to come across as ungrateful.,"I am turning 30 soon and I have never celebrated a birthday. This is the only birthday I've ever wanted to celebrate, and I really wanted to have a birthday party as I've never had one. 

I expressed this to my boyfriend and he started making hints that I should not organise anything  implying he was throwing me a surprise birthday party. A little while ago we were both drunk and I asked if I should start planning my birthday party and he said not to and basically told me he was planning it and we had a discussion on what i wanted it to be like. 

I have spent the past few month excited about this birthday party and keep imagining the people hed invite and how it would look etc. Well fast forward to last week and my birthday is in a few weeks. One of my friends had messaged me saying ""omg when in August is your birthday again pls dont tell me i missed it!"" Which was weird because she should definitely be invited to my birthday party. 

So I brought it up to my boyfriend saying ""X asked about when my birthday was but she should definitely be invited to something right?"" 
He theb told me he changed his mind about planning a birthday party and was going to take me to London for a weekend instead. Note that London is somewhere I've been many times, I have no desire to go there again and dont really like the place, which he knows, but I just pretended to be happy about it. 

I felt so upset. Like I was really looking forward to my ""surprise"" birthday party but not only was that not happening, I now have barely any time to plan the birthday party I really wanted. But fine, I'll plan my own with the little time I have and started to tell my friends to keep the 30th free as I wanted to celebrate my birthday then. 

Well then my bf told me to get the 29th off work, as he was taking me to Amsterdam for the weekend, he just booked the flights and hotel. These last minute bookings tells me he only came up with this idea because I questioned him about my party and he needed an excuse of why he didnt plan anything for it. 

So now I am not getting the party I was expecting and now I can't even plan my own because my bf is taking me out of the country. 

I do love amsterdam and I would love to spend a couple of days there with him, but I really wanted to celebrate my birthday with my friends and a party for the first time ever.

How do I tell him I dont want to go to Amsterdam and no longer want to do anything for my birthday because he has ruined my plans? I am grateful he had booked a weekend away but I really just want to forget about my birthday completely now and pretend it isn't happening like I've spent the rest of my life doing.

1mnepts,"Parents gaslit me to believe a serious crisis was ""mild depression and anxiety"" while hiding ""Aspergers"" diagnosis for nearly a decade","I know this forum has many posts discussing similar things here, but still wanted to get this off my chest.

I remember being told I had ""Aspergers"" when I was 12. I was sent to see a psychiatrist because my parents thought I was ""depressed"". Instead, the psychiatrist referred me to ""services that will make sure nobody will misunderstand you anymore"" (I wasn't given any more details but I suspect I might have been sent to some kind fo ABA center). The psychiatrist made a point to ask my mother not to deny the fact that I am neurodivergent.

It didn't work. Both my parents were helluva in denial. I'm NC with both now, but I suspect they're staying in denial even at this point. I won't bother breaking NC to ask them.

They'd tell me to ""stop acting so autistic"" and chalk all my problems to ""being depressed and anxious"" in the same breath. But even without naming autism, they were as ableist as it could get. They'd say clearly insulting things, but when I tried calling them out, I was told ""I misunderstood because I lack social skills"". Forced me to watch TV shows because they thought it would ""help me learn social skills"". 

  
Forced me into cosmetic braces 4 times because they wanted a beautiful daughter. I'm not exaggerating.The first 3 times, I dropped out because the braces overstimulated me to the point I couldn't sleep at night. The last time, my mother had 4 of my teeth removed at the beginning of the procedure, presumably to prevent me from backing out. Then it was daily meltdowns and shutdowns for 2 years. I was dissociating heavily through the dentist visit. I remember being told ""I have to put up with these \[braces\] if I want to become beautiful"". 

TO FUCK WITH BEAUTY. I never asked for it. I would have never traded 2 years of my life in a formative period just to endure a cosmetic procedure that caused daily shutdowns and tanked my sanity to dangerous points. It's beyond me why anyone would waste this amount of time and money for something that means nothing but pain and suffering to me. 

Through all this, my pain had no name because I was denied the verbiage to describe it. All this while the fact that I was neurodivergent was actively hidden from me. 

All it did was force me into (strongly internalized and thus invisible) meltdowns. When I overheard my father discussing ""dumping \[me\] into a mental institution"", I knew I had to leave at all costs.

From 17 to 19, I was going through a very dark period which I don't want to elaborate on. All I'm going to say is that the fact that I was in a crisis should have been obvious as flying fuck. But I was repeatedly told all I had was ""merely mild depression and anxiety"". That I couldn't possibly be suffering because I had ""such good grades"". I brought up autism but was quickly shut down - ""you can't possibly have autism, you can talk"". I was repeatedly told I was ""doing fine"". I was practically begging my parents and mental health providers for validation but nothing came of it.

Later, my mother told me she intentionally withheld validation because she thought it would make me weak and use my struggles as a crutch.

It seems a lot of people around me really wanted to keep me down at all costs. When I was achieving despite mistreatment, they weaponized my efforts to deny my critical support. When I broke down, they weaponized that to tell me I will never amount to anything so I'd better ""lower my standards and accept defeat"".

It felt almost as if I was being punished for my perseverance. Even to this day there is a part of me that thinks what is the point of working for a better future if all my efforts will get weaponized to make me suffer in silence.

Obviously, cutting parents off when I was barely an adult hasn't been all sunshines and roses. But whenever I question my decision, even a very small portion what my parents inflicted upon me are enough to remind me why NC was absolutely necessary.

1mnw0z1,28M living on his own,"Hello there. I'm 28 (M), on the spectrum, and live here in Indiana. Life was rough growing up, and my family wasn't...perfect. I honestly thought I might be doomed to live with either my mother or father until they died then wind up in an assisted living facility. But 3 years ago, I finally got my own apartment, which is all I ever wanted. 

I always pay my rent and bills on time, and I have the support of my family when things get tough. I get along with most of my neighbors. I have a best friend who lives in the same complex as me who's also on the spectrum, yet he's way much more calmer than me. The noises outside sometimes bug me, but I learned to handle it quite well. I have managed to keep my own place for three whole years!

I always wanted to prove to others I can be independent so when the day comes when my parents are ready to leave this world, they won't have to worry about me.

1mo98kt,Food intolerances,"So long story short, I have no fewer than 13 different food intolerances and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. I'm supposed to cut everything I can't have out of my diet and slowly back in to see if it causes enough issues for me to just not eat them anymore.   
Needless to say, that's all my safe foods. Also, I hate cooking and now I have to prep food pretty much every time I want to eat, unless it's a cheese stick or fruit.   
I'm thirty three. I'm going into an absolute tail spin. Yesterday was so hard. I basically sat there googling work-arounds and trying to find pre-made bread I could eat while having nothing but coffee. I finally got up the drive to make myself some roasted chicken with steamed broccoli and rice around 4:30 PM and felt way better after eating (even though it was gross! I had no safe oil so I had to cook it with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and a little water. It didn't tase good at all!)   
I sent my partner for oatmeal and brown sugar. I might be able to survive on that a little better.   
I now can't eat lobster (ok, fair, don't think I've ever tried) and because lobster triggered, all shellfish is out (again, totally fine.) Cantaloupe, cabbage, potatoes, and onions popped up, and the inability to eat potatoes is, like, full blown meltdown worthy. I love my potatoes. Sunflower, soybean, buckwheat, and corn are both my biggest reactions and what's tripping me up most. I'm struggling to find many things at all that don't contain at least one of these. Hazelnuts and pistachios, I can take or leave those- my teeth aren't great anyways but I do love Nutella. However I shouldn't really eat any tree nuts now, at least not while I'm on an elimination diet. Green peas, no worries, there are other veggies I like more. Peanuts- well, I knew that already, and I was already operating under the assumption that I had a full blown peanut allergy and can't eat peanuts without possibly dying, but now I know I can potentially eat peanut butter without wrecking myself in the future, that's cool. Doesn't feel very helpful right now.   
This is so isolating. I can't eat meals with my family. I've doubled my pill intake. I really hope this helps me feel better, because honestly if I have to go through 2-4 weeks of eating nothing good (I can't even have an ensure!) and I still feel like crap, it's going to feel totally worthless.

I’ve always been the weird cousin. The family reunions weren’t family reunions. They were “ the family” AND Matias. When I was diagnosed back in march my hopes were that with time when the rest of my family knew, they would be somewhat understanding. I hoped that they would be mature enough to not just label me as the special family member. Unfortunately that happened. So if before no one talked to me, now no one even approaches me. It’s almost like a dumb movie how every time I speak they turn into that stupid confusion and cringe faces. And then they continue their conversation like I never talked. That just makes me bored. I’m bored of how the literally only talk about drinking, hot guys and girls and making flat jokes. That’s why I go to the bathroom where I can at least listen to music. I spent about 30 minutes in there and when I got out nobody even noticed I was gone. I spent other 20 minutes back “with” the group and I got back to the bathroom. That’s where I am right now writing this with a mix of boredom and loneliness. I’ve always seen the belief of family being always trustworthy a bit odd, but now that i think about it it’s probably just the conditioning I’ve learned to live in, and probably most of people’s families are truly supporting. I guess I’m just dissapointed to the way things played out since. I mean, it’s not their fault for not liking me, I’m not trying to give that message. I’m sad because this situation happened. I’m sad for being born autistic. Maybe it’s childish to blame it on autism because it could perfectly be me being socially weird but right now I don’t find other explanation.

First of all, I hope I'm not posting this with an incorrect flair or in the incorrect place. I'll try my best to keep my post relatively short!

So I regularly tense up my face pretty bad. I think it looks like a face of disgust or pain, I've also seen it described as ""scrunching up the face""?

There are months where it barely bothers me, but recently it has gotten worse again. I unintentionally ""scrunch up"" my face for long periods of times and I need to actively concentrate in order to stop it. But as soon as I stop actively focusing on relaxing my face, it tenses up again. On good days, it only annoys me, but on bad days, it really hurts my face a lot. 

(I'm not sure if that already counts as a tic or not. Often my stims are unintentional too, but I have more control over them than over that face scrunching thing. So I used both terms in the title, I hope that's okay!) 

Do some of you struggle with this too? 
And/or do you have any kinds of advice for me? For example, ideas for reducing the pain or even stuff I could do to reduce the frequency of tensing up my face?

1mo0h1t,"Is it normal for friends to make jokes as if I were a top, ""open mouth"" and slow?","

22 I'm not diagnosed, but I suspect that if I am I would be level 1.

One of the things that annoys me the most is calling myself an ""open mouth"" when I'm totally responsible and intelligent, I'm agile and so it doesn't make sense.

People think I'm autistic.

I don't return my discomfort because I don't like conflicts and offending people, but the situations are more veiled, when I'm not present, then people talk to me about what they comment.

These days 2 friends called to make a dinner with shrimp at her house and sleep there, so I sent a message in the group if the shrimp had to peel or if it was already clean (I asked more to make an average there in the conversation, right), they answered yes.

I was at home and these 2 friends were together at the time I asked.

This weekend I was also with my other friends, and by coincidence they were in the same public environment as these other 2 friends were, and they heard one saying like this ""Brenda asked about the shrimp if it comes clean, very slow"" and followed the laughter.

These friends of mine told me and said they didn't like the way they talked about me, when they heard it.

And apart from making jokes that they find funny in my way, in my work they make comments that I'm ""open mouth"", that they think I'm autistic.

I also work with public service and I always notice giggles, curses, and clearly calling me with my mouth open and slow.

It's as if people already took it out to them that I'm like that, and it bothers me because I feel that they don't give me credibility, attention and I learned that I'm a source of laughter and joke even in the subjects I talk to, even from these friends, no one takes me seriously, and in the face of my responsibilities I never faltered.

In addition to these friends, and co-workers, people of close coexistence also make veiled jokes, for example I'm going to take a shower there they already say ihh now it's over, or compare me to someone else of my age.",1754977337.0,3,3,autism,autism

I don’t text her constantly maybe once a month. Ive stopped texting her once I noticed she always was too busy to hang out. So I thought maybe she was stressed and I wanted to give her space. But it has been 2-3 months or so. She does view my stories which makes me even more confused as to why she doesn’t text me first.

1mo5piu,"Question to the research / academia geeks: As I try to make sense of that newly discovered autism side of mine, I constructed some mental models for me. Are they aligned with the state of research so far?","As written in the title, I trying to make sense of how my brain works, to make it feel less ""out of nowhere"" and to be able to predict a bit better how interactions with others might go. For context, I got diagnosed with PDD (with mainly ADHD and Autism parts) and high IQ (which came as a shock to me, I was convinced I was dumb lol).

# MENTAL MODEL 1: Autism seems to make me yearn to understand a specific system more, before I feel comfortable to make a generalization about it.

* POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE: I take a longer time to move to another topic in a conversation, because my understanding of the current topic is not complete enough yet for me. When it feels complete enough however, I am fine with moving on. I prefer explicit moving on by everyone acknowledging the switch, since otherwise I am unsure whether someone has some input that not brought up yet.

  * This could mean that maybe I am not ""slower"" or ""bad at prioritizing"" - I would simply be taking more stuff into account before taking action, which naturally takes time. If that would be true, then a NT person would be as slow as me if they would be tasked to take into account either A) more stuff or B) more details

*  POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE: I can work on a single topic longer than NT people because I explore more properties of the topic, and am less likely to get bored (a NT person might have all the information they need faster and are ready to move on / draw a conclusion, hence, get bored)

# MENTAL MODEL 2: Autism seems to make me prefer systems (interactions with my environment) that are predictable

* POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE: I communicate (both sending and recieving) by using as little additional context as possible outside of the given words. If I think additional context might be needed, I tend to (and appreciate if others do!) give that context verbally and often up front.

  * This might also be why I often prefer written to oral communication: Less non-word information.

* POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE: When not masking, in my ""natural"" state, I assume that other people behave and think according to what I think is a reasonable default, with the expectation that they come to the same conclusion and communicate if they derivate from that default. (That is also true for myself: I often say ""you might think X about me, but because of Y, ...""). (Note: Of course, I am aware that this is neither how other people nor often myself do work)

This could also mean (which would allign with the double empathy problem) that I do not per se have trouble empathizing - rather, I have trouble to emphasize naturally with people A) whose inner state is fine-tuned differently, they can tolerate / do not sense prediction errors as strongly and B) just as I do with them, assume about me that I work with their default, i.e. communicate in a way that uses more fuzzy clues like posture and so on

# Open questions

* Does the above make somewhat sense? Am I off somewhere? (Note: I am not going for exhaustiveness, i.e. the above does not account for gender differences. Additions are great, but getting corrected would be more important to me)

* Is that pull towards predictability rather driven by reward, or avoidance of a penalty, or both?

* The above is framed in a ND-affirming way. Is there evidence that points towards an impairment rather than simply another mode of being? I want to be as informed as possible! (since this is a potentially hot topic: I see those two modes as compatible: Autism could be a different mode of being that statistically also comes with some of what medicine would call an impairment.

	•	Sus respuestas tienden a ser más lógicas que emocionales, y eso puede hacer que el tono parezca frío aunque no lo sea.

2. Búsqueda de claridad constante
	•	Hace muchas preguntas para entender mejor una situación.
	•	Las preguntas no son para desafiarte ni molestarte, sino porque necesita tener claridad y seguridad sobre lo que se está hablando.

3. Comunicación muy directa
	•	Responde con mucha sinceridad o sin filtro.
	•	Él te pide la misma sinceridad y transparencia a ti.
	•	No suele “endulzar” las palabras para suavizar el mensaje, porque su prioridad es que la información sea precisa.

4. Ritmo distinto para cerrar conflictos
	•	Puede querer resolver un tema de inmediato y de forma lógica.
	•	Tú puedes necesitar procesarlo emocionalmente antes, lo que a veces provoca un desfase en tiempos y expectativas.

I have very high levels of sensory sensitivities. I stick to a few safe outfits in order to accommodate myself. The problem is that my safe outfits generally look 'unkempt' in neurotypical standards. 

I don't care much about my appearance but I'm concerned that the way I present is attracting a lot of judgement and mistreatment. I live in a conservative area with a passive aggressive shaming culture. People judge and gossip over the smallest things. Some people act like they're mentally living in the 1950's - they can't imagine taking any kind of pushback from a young woman. Every time I call their bullshit, they FLIP OUT.

Every time I have to interact with someone, I can't shake off the thought that they're treating me as less than because they've made a snap judgement based on how I dress. 

Doesn't help that I'm AFAB - sexism means anyone read as a woman are automatically held up to arbitrarily higher grooming standards. I see men dressing comfortably and nobody bats an eye. But whenever I go out wearing almost the same clothes, suddenly my neighbors have a problem. People glare at me like I'm not human. And being autistic, every glare registers like a gut punch.

Growing up, I used to be beaten and shamed for having sensory sensitivities. Like being forced into a corner and slapped an inordinate number of times just because I couldn't tolerate what my mother wanted me to wear. Forced and shamed into outfits that felt like literal torture, that made me dissociate and worse.

I can't come up with a presentable look without torturing myself. 

In theory, I know it's important to look presentable. Not that this is right or fair, but I do know a 'well put together' appearance can open doors that would otherwise remain locked. 

  
I want to work. I have marketable skills that I genuinely enjoy cultivating. I can deliver if given the opportunity. But I'm seeing that something that has nothing to do with my skills or qualification is about to derail the vast majority of opportunities I can have.

However, so far they’ve only had me working up front. Working out front drains me badly and I end up nonverbal at home often, and regularly crying over the overwhelming feeling that comes with having to mask for me. 

My question is, if I were to request accommodations, would it likely be okay if I request specifically to work only in the drive through when possible? I can handle a couple of shifts a week doing front of house, but constant shifts of that will likely lead to me leaving this job. I know my specific location is lacking on drive through workers, but I am worried that my manager will find my request foolish. If anyone has any input, I’d love to hear it! This would be the only accommodation I would need. ",1754992691.0,1,3,autism,autism

1mo426i,"Is it possible that Dorothy Dandridge’s daughter, Harolyn Suzanne Nicholas, had autism?","I went down a rabbit hole about Dorothy Dandridge and discovered she had a daughter: According to this article, “By 1943, Dorothy Dandridge was an up-and-coming young actress living in Los Angeles. Newly married to dancer Harold Nicholas and pregnant with her first child, she went into labor on Sept. 2 while at her sister-in-law’s house.
Dandridge wanted to go to the hospital, but her husband had taken the car to play golf. She delayed the birth — and later came to believe that doing so had cut off oxygen to Nicholas’ brain, resulting in permanent brain damage.
“Dottie never got over the overwhelming guilt she felt because she thought she was responsible for her child’s condition,” Geraldine Branton, Dandridge’s sister-in-law and close friend, explained to EBONY magazine. “She lived with that thought every day of her life. You could never convince her she wasn’t at fault…In 1963, Dorothy Dandridge made an appearance on The Mike Douglas Show. Beautiful, sophisticated, and the first Black actress to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, she seemed to have it all. But on that day, Dandridge shared a sad secret she’d kept about her daughter, Harolyn Suzanne Nicholas.
“My daughter had a brain injury at birth,” Dandridge told the stunned studio audience. “I could sense that something was wrong when she was about two years old.” Apparently, she “couldn’t speak”.

 Managers at my job set certain rules, like not being on your phone on the sales floor (I work at a grocery store), but then I see them on their phones all the damn time.

Police pull you over for going 5 MPH over the speed limit, but then they drive 10-15 MPH over, even if they aren't responding to a call. Teachers make a big deal about turning your work in on time, but then they take WAY LONGER to grade it than you did to complete it. My parents get mad at me if I do so much as shut a door slightly too hard after an argument, but then they can swear, talk to themselves, tell me how horrible I'm acting, but if I dare challenge their ""authority"", I get in huge trouble.

In America, there's...

Working disabled medicaid buy-in - allows you to work, and pay a premium toward your medicaid most state you can make between 50-120K a year without your benefits being affected.  If you live in the south though, you aren't getting it, they completely block any type of support for us.

HIPP Program - Allows for you to access your employers sponsored health Insurance long as you keep medicaid eligibility, only available for those with disabilities with high medical costs. Not available in every state, but it pays your companies premiums and Medicaid coverage your deductibles up until the max out of pocket. then whatever the insurance doesn't cover.

Able account - It allows you to save 100k if on ssdi or ssi if your disabled happened before 26, and in about a year 46. If your not on social security you can have a range of 200-400,000$+ in saving without it effecting your benefits with the expectation of HUD.

HUD - They have specify vouchers for those with disabilities, and are called different things based upon your state or city. If your state hud list is super long have your case manger, parent, sibling just not you call your senator or representative to let them know that you need help about getting Housing vouchers. It's a way to get you higher on the list.

Health Department City/State - they usually have housing and utility vouchers some one time only others revolving. Mine has 3 different housing programs for state, and 1 for my city alone. Along with a few utilities programs that are separate from public assistance.

1115 waiver - this is a extension of medicaid, not a real waiver, but it allows you to get extensive amount of mental health services not found underneath regular Medicaid. This could also be used for substance use. This program saves my butt so plz take advance of it.

Food stamps - Just apple for it, and volunteer if they require you to work. there are many that can allow you do this remotely. if you are on ssi/ssdi then you don't need to do that.

Vocational Rehabilitation- They can help you get yourself retrained, and ready for a job along with pay for college, training, apprenticeships, etc. They paid for me to get therapy, and get tech to help me with my job.

1mnkllv,So very lonely. Vent.,"""I wouldn't have it any other way because it makes me me"" is a cope.

Being autistic is a big negative that significantly lowers your quality of life.

I am here at 29, living at home, with a few friends, and haven't had a relationship since I was a teenager, after a lifetime of being misunderstood and treated like I am a defective person. Finally, getting my feet on the ground.

Besides chess, I do not have many hobbies or interests. I spend all my time overthinking the past. If I communicate with someone from those times, it is clear they do not all care about me anymore.

Alongside the ruminating, I talk to myself. I live with my parents, who do not understand. I have tactics to handle talking to myself and anger ruminating now, but my parents have zero tolerance for any symptoms at all. I think if I moved out, other people would be somewhat more understanding than my parents.

When I tried to reach out, hardly anyone was responsive. I came across neo-nazis, rapists, and malignant narcissists because normal people do not want me around. I was desperate for some form of connection and thought there was a hack I was missing. I have stalkers and narcissists who launched smear campaigns on me, and I would not have come across them if the normal people had just let me in. Luckily, they have been unsuccessful, but they and I have one thing in common: we are extreme outliers, and that is why we connected.

If someone lets me in, it is not the norm. It is someone unusually open-minded who tolerates me. I do not believe I broke any social rules. It is solely based on ""vibes.""

Everyone called me awkward, then they grew up and moved on. I am an overgrown teenager. Things people take for granted, like friends, relationships, and starting families, I'm not sure if those will ever be accessible to me. I blame money, but it is not money, because plenty of broke men start families, friends, and relationships. It is because nobody wants to spend time with me.

I'm not sure if it was worse to feel locked out of human society, but I think there was a social hack I was missing - or to realise I am locked out of human society because of who I inherently am.

I am almost 30. I am living a similar lifestyle to ten years ago. If there was this secret code that was going to make everything better, I would have found it now. Diagnosis gave me the ability to cope with life instead of being a severely mentally ill beneficiary, but I still feel like I live a half-life compared to many of my peers.

I can tell who is and is not autistic based on outcomes in life. Many of the people I knew online ended up in bad situations. Unemployment, severe physical and mental illnesses, and radical leftist ideology. For those who were not online, involuntarily single.

I have few friends. Even if I get a lot of praise from my customer service role, I feel isolated and disconnected from everyone else. The things people take for granted seem out of my reach. Instead of calling it sad, I am forced to redefine the definitions of what society takes for granted.

\- To reject the timeline society expects of us.

\- To be comfortable with a few worthwhile friends in a world that does not understand us.

\- To define failure as being in a toxic relationship instead of being single.

I have had a remarkable turnaround since diagnosis.

\- From beneficiary to highly valued by employers.

\- From -$2,500 overdraft to $50,000 invested.

\- From overweight to losing 20kg and 10,000 steps/day.

\- From around nazis to being involved in my Pride community

\- From addicted to social media to deleting my entire presence and getting a brick phone

\- From severe OCD (planning to call the police over mean internet comments) to reducing my symptoms by 50%

But even with turning it all around, would I restart my life without autism?

Looking back, a lot of my lifelong struggles could fit either autism or ADHD inattentive:
	•	Constant daydreaming/zoning out
	•	Forgetting what I was doing mid-task
	•	Struggling to start things even when I want to do them
	•	Jumping between topics so fast I can’t even follow myself

At the same time, my autism traits haven’t gone anywhere which means daily life is:
	•	Needing routines but constantly breaking them
	•	Hyperfocusing for hours and forgetting to eat/drink/pee
	•	Craving novelty but struggling with unexpected change
	•	Switching between sensory-seeking and sensory-avoidant depending on the day

I think I might be AuDHD (autism + ADHD) and I honestly don’t know how to process this. I’ve spent years thinking I was “just autistic,” and now it feels like I’ve been running two operating systems at the same time without realizing it.

For anyone who’s been through this how did you bring it up with your parents, doctors, or therapists? I’m not against self-diagnosis at all (I think it’s completely valid), but since I have the resources, I’d like to explore it formally and see if I can get a clear answer.",1754935432.0,8,5,autism,autism

1mnrjtf,Sharing the second chapter of my novel. This chapter is from an autistic character's pov. Just need opinions. Is it good?,"The first chapter is from Imogen. A character with adhd.

The second chapter is from Ji-won. An autistic character. 



Did you know that the average lifespan of an American is approximately 79.6 years? I’m 18, so I have around 61.6 years left to live. I want to spend those years doing things I enjoy, not sitting through interviews with overly glorified interviewers who don’t care about the people they’re talking to. You might think I’m being overly critical. Maybe I am. Everyone always says I should look on the bright side, but I prefer the truth.

“Ji-won, water?” Tao, the leader of our group, hands me a bottle of water without waiting for me to respond.

I take it and twist off the top. After taking a big gulp, I twist the top back on. The water is cold and makes my hands wet. I set the water down on the ground and wiped my hands off on the sides of my pants. I hate water. I hate how it feels and how wet it is. I drink it only because I would die if I didn’t. Sometimes I’m tempted to stop drinking water out of spite.

“If everyone is ready, we should start filming again.” The interviewer stands in front of the five of us like he’s trying to herd a group of cats.

Tao nods and gets to his feet. “Of course. Come on, guys.” He waves us over.

Reluctantly, I follow. I take my seat at the end, and Imogen sits next to me. She’s never far away.

Beside her, Myth gets out of her wheelchair and moves to one of the leather chairs on set. One of the crew members takes her wheelchair and tucks it safely away. I eye him suspiciously. We’ve had issues with Myth’s wheelchair and crutches before. People aren’t careful with them, and they break.

“We’re just going to head straight into the questions, alright?” The interviewer waves his hands for the cameras to start rolling. As soon as I see the light on the cameras, I freeze up. Something is daunting about knowing that how you act or behave at this exact time will be recorded and kept forever.

Everyone is patient as the interviewer looks through his cards. Beside me, Imogen fiddles with her long blonde hair. The light color has hints of pink from the last time she dyed it.

“What are your favorite activities outside of music?”

Cal answers immediately. “Art, I love art so much.”

“He’s amazing!” Imogen praises. Her smile stretches across her face. I know things like this make her uncomfortable, but even so, she’s good at them.

The interviewer nods along. “What’s your favorite type of art? Drawing painting…” His voice cut off as Cal interrupts.

“Oh, I love painting the most. Acrylics. I like watercolor as well, but acrylics will always be my first love. I have also started oil pastels. I’m still learning through.”

“And Myth is great at photography,” Tao adds to keep the conversation going. He’s also really good with interviews. Talking and interacting with people just come naturally to him. I don’t care enough to put in the effort.

“Myth, do you have any photos you would be willing to share?” The interviewer leans forward.

She nods as she takes out her phone to search for a photo.

“Here.” Cal stands and reaches over to the interviewer. He shows him and the camera the image on his phone. It’s a photo of his latest piece. He said it was about joy and happiness, but it just looked like colors to me. It’s pretty, but I don’t understand the concept.

He swipes to the next picture.

“This is one of the latest pictures Myth sent to me.”

I bite my lip. It’s a funny photo of us goofing off. Not a rare occurrence, but Myth still feels the need to document it.

Everyone laughs at the photo. I just smile so I don’t come off as mean or rude.

“Wow, you both are so talented. Tao, how about you? I know you are also extremely gifted.”

He shakes his head. “I’m not that good at anything.” Tao smiles awkwardly.

“That’s not true!” Imogen stands up and puts her hands in the air. “You are super good at sports, and tons of music-related things. I wish I could be good at sports. You really should see him when he gets competitive.” Her voice is loud.

Cal looks at her. “I agree. He’s great.”

“Thanks, guys.” Tao’s face is red. I hide a laugh behind my hand. He acts like he doesn’t like the attention or compliments, but truthfully, he gets upset without them. So picky.

“Imogen and I love horror movies.” I blurt out before my brain has the chance to stop me.

Everyone turns to me. I blink.

“He’s right.” Imogen sits back down and clasps her hands together. “Horror movies are the best. They make you feel afraid, but not too much because it’s only a movie. It’s great.”

I smile as I listen to her talk.

“I hate horror movies.” Cal interrupts.

The rest of the group hates horror movies as well. We took them to see a movie in the theater once, but Cal left in the middle to hide in the bathroom. Myth and Tao tried to act like they didn’t care, but Tao screamed every five minutes. It was annoying. We never took them again.

“I’m not the biggest fan of horror movies either.” The interviewer admits.

I roll my eyes. Weak.

“You have been making music for a few years now. Who first supported your music career?” The interviewer looks at us, waiting for an answer.

“My uncle supported me through everything. I wouldn’t be here without him. He’s sacrificed so much for me.” Tao looks at one of the many cameras. “Uncle, thank you for supporting me even when my singing sounded like a fire alarm.”

I laugh along with my friends. It was true he had sounded like a fire alarm. I still have video of it.

“It sounds like your uncle is a wonderful person.”

“He really is.” Myth nods in agreement. “He helps us with everything.”

“Our parents are also pretty amazing,” Cal adds. He runs a hand over his short, coily hair.

Imogen straightens instantly. “I would like to thank my mom and dad for being amazing and helping me through everything.”

I can’t process what she said before more words came flying from her mouth.

“And I would like to thank my little brother, who is the best.” She stops talking and sucks in a breath.

I place a hand on her arm. Our eyes meet. Imogen nods and takes a deep breath.

The interviewer goes on. “Some of you have been open about being neurodivergent and special needs. Do you feel like that influences your creativity and how you approach music?

“Disabled, not special needs. My needs aren’t special, they are just needs.” Myth says bluntly.

“My apologies.” The interviewer’s face began to turn red. “How does being neurodivergent and disabled influence your creativity?”

Myth nods her approval. “Well, for me, I’m autistic and struggle with different mobility issues. I can’t dance or move around the stage as much, but that forces us to be creative with our performances. It means we stand out as a group.”

“Yes, we all have our varying issues, but we always work around them.” Tao tilts his head to the side and waits for Cal or Imogen to add something.

Like expected, Imogen opens her mouth and a full paragraph comes out.

“I have ADHD. Most people know that. I’ve never really fit anywhere, but with these guys I fit. We all fit. We created our home, our community. I want us and our music to be a home to those who feel like they don’t fit in. I believe if you feel as if you don’t belong in this world, you’re here to create a better one. I want to create a better world. I want to write music and do my best for anyone who feels like they don’t belong.” Her legs start to bounce up and down as her talking speeds up.

I can’t help but smile at her as I listen. She’s always so passionate about music. I respect that.

“I really like how you said that.” Tao interrupts. “We may not fit with others, but we fit together.” He looks at each of us with a smile on his face.

I sigh and smile back. I’m very happy to have them even when they annoy me. And they do annoy me all the time. They treat it like an Olympic sport.

“You’re all still very different. How do you support each other while touring?”

“This is our third and biggest tour yet.” Tao shakes his head in disbelief. “It’s hard to comprehend. The previous times, we always made sure to take breaks in between traveling and shows. We all need breaks, but it’s mostly for Myth and Ji-won. We make sure to stay at places that are wheelchairs accessible. Simple things like that.”

Cal leans forward. “We make sure the outfits we wear when performing are comfortable and that everything is as calm as possible. I mean, we aren’t calm, but everything else is until we get onto the stage.”

The interviewer mumbles a few yeses under his breath. For some reason, he’s starting to annoy me. “You’ve become role models for many fans who are neurodivergent and spec- disabled. What does that mean to you?” He leans forward.

“It means a lot,” Imogen answers right away. “It means a lot to me, but I’m sure it means a lot for all of us.” She looks around.

I nod to assure her that she said the right thing. It does mean a lot. I look down. I understand how important it is to know yourself. Myth and Imogen shared with me how discovering they were autistic and ADHD made them feel so much better. You can’t help yourself if you don’t understand what’s happening with your body or mind. Once you know, things can start to improve.

“You’ve been a group for a few years now. Where do you see Hidden Mosaic in five years? Any big plans?”

Tao fixes his beanie before answering. “I would like us to write more amazing songs and to keep touring. I just want us to enjoy what we do, and I want- I hope that the fans will go on this journey with us.”

“I want to enjoy what we do, too. I want to touch as many people’s hearts as possible.” Imogen takes a deep breath.

“Those are all very good plans.” The interviewer tilts his head to the side. “The world needs more people who just want to enjoy their lives.”

“True.” Imogen straightens. I wait for her to go on a rant about people living their lives just to work and get money, but she doesn’t. I place my hand around her shoulders and lean over. She relaxes slightly in my embrace. The interview will be over soon, then we can sleep before we have to leave for the tour the next morning. Tomorrow is going to be a crazy day.

“Are there any plans for upcoming songs or any big news?”

Tao laughs. Both Myth and I slap a hand over Imogen’s mouth.

“Hey!” Her voice is muffled beneath our hands.

The interviewer bursts out laughing. “Imogen, I’ve heard you have a reputation for spoiling things.”

Imogen scowls at Myth and ignores me. “I get excited to share things, and ya, I tend to spoil them.” She looks down at her hands in her lap.

I rub her shoulder gently. I hate it when she feels sad because it makes me feel sad.

“No news to share? Nothing at all?” Everyone laughs slightly as the interviewer pushes the question.

“There is something big coming up, but we can’t say anything just yet.” Tao grins at the camera. “We won’t keep you in the dark longer than we have to. Promise.”

He was talking about the Golden Star Music Awards. We were nominated for the awards this year in multiple categories. We won’t know anything concrete for a few months, but we’re all super excited. The Golden Star Music Awards happen every year. There are categories for different types of music, like Best Country or Best K-pop. There are also awards for Song of the Year or Best Collaboration. If we do make it to the final rounds, we will be attending the awards show at the end of the year. When I found out we may be attending the awards, I watched the previous four award shows. The night starts off with food and talking. Then they will start announcing the winners. Whoever wins in each category will perform something they practiced beforehand. It seems like it could be a lot of fun, but I’m not one to rub elbows with celebrities. Besides, I would rather sleep.

“Not even a little hint?” The interviewer must not know body language.

“No, not yet.” Tao shut him down again.

“Okay, that’s all we have for today.” The interviewer stands and bows slightly. He seems flustered. We all stand except for Myth.

He shakes each of our hands again.

I watch Tao to see what he does. He turns to the cameras and waves. “We are Hidden Mosaic. Thank you for having us on your show.”

I smile and wave as the cameras turn off and the crew relaxes. I let my smile fade away. Smiles are pointless unless someone is looking at you.

“Everyone ready to go home?” Tao’s soft smile warms the cold room.

“Ya.” Myth answers monotone. “Tired.”

I’m tired too. The lights in here are way too bright and flicker way too much. I reach for Imogen’s arm before leaving the building. We drove here together. The others live across town from us.

“Do you want to stop for smoothies?” Imogen asks me.

1mnr9u9,I'm having a hard time writing because of stimming,"Hey, so I'm a uni student (year 2 of psychology BA) 
I'm 24, and I'm writing assignments for the last few days, however I'm hitting a wall. 

With studying for tests I would rock back and forth or move my hands while reading, but now that I need to write and assignment I can't quite play with my hands, and my back and forth rocking has gotten much more extreme in the past few months (in the sense that the motion is more exaggerated, so it's not a small/unnoticeable rocking, but more like a very big and noticeable rocking. Instead of a 25 angle rock for example it now like 60 degrees rocking).

Because the rocking is more extreme it's hard to focus on the screen and read, and writing is extremely hard because of the hand movements. Im chewing gum in the hopes it'll help a bit (I usually don't because it makes me hungry). Shaking my legs is also not enough.

1mnyj5t,Tips for making a move easier,"Greetings.

My partner is not diagnosed or seeking any diagnosis, but he definitely has some...neurodivergent tendencies/attitudes. We have been living separately and are moving in together soon. Great situation - but he is stressed.

I figured this community is one who has built strategies for dealing with big changes. Can anyone give me any insight into how to make a move easier? If you've moved recently, what stressed you out about it? Anything you didn't expect that I can step in early to make easy for him?

I'm someone who is very particular* about my environment, the cleanliness and balance and how things are placed. Really, we are both creatures of habit and anticipate some clashes for this reason. We have a separate bedroom situation - I think that will help tremendously.

But any other advice is welcome! We do have a lot of shared interests, and I've enjoyed recreating my own place so many times, I'm definitely going to let him spearhead decorating/organizing the common areas to his comfort. (I don't care where we store the pots or hang this picture, ya know?)

I'm also trying to do most of the phone calling/organizing utilities, internet, etc. so he can just focus on getting his things together and take care of one or two things for us.

1mnm4vy,Dating as an autistic person 🙄,"I just need to vent rq. These past few months I've started dating and I've had some good and some bad experiences. I'm finally at a point in my life where I feel like I have a decent amount of control and I'm happy and healthy for the most part, so I finally feel like a relationship is something that could really enhance my life at this point. It's especially difficult not just because of the autism, but I'm also trans which makes it that much harder to find people. I always tell people I'm an acquired taste, I know my personality isn't something everyone can handle, which is fine. I've been told I'm weird (derogatory, obviously I know I'm weird, but I don't think it's bad), childish, annoying, etc and that had really decreased my self esteem. I know these things about myself, but hearing people say it to me in a negative sense has really hurt. I want to find someone that I share interests with but can also have their own things; I want someone who can push me out of my comfort  zone, but knows when I shouldn't be; someone who can genuinely love and support me, and makes me laugh. I know it's a lot to ask for in a person and maybe my standards are too high, but I also know if I don't have at least most of these things, I won't be as happy as I'd want to be. Ive never been in love, and I find it really difficult to get feelings for someone (maybe I just have bad luck with dating lol), but sometimes I worry that I physically can't get those feelings because of my autism, which I know isn't probably true and I really do want to experience that. I feel like I go through these moments when I think about dating and I get really depressed because it just isn't working, and I know it can't be forced, but it makes me feel hopeless about it sometimes, which is hard. I know it'll happen when the time comes, but man it's annoying. Dating sucks, people suck and having autism on top of it makes it suck even more. ",1754939452.0,3,5,autism,autism

1mnivko,Would meltdown prediction be useful for you?,"I’m autistic and working on a wearable + app to predict meltdowns before they hit.

For me, once I understood what a meltdown was, it became easier to recover faster and avoid some triggers.
But I still can’t always tell before it’s happening.
By the time I notice, I’m already in “too late” mode - sensory input is overwhelming, communication drops, and my body just goes into shutdown or fight mode.

My current strategies:

Leaving noisy/crowded places when I start feeling physically tense.

Using noise-cancelling headphones before entering high-sensory areas.

Avoiding back-to-back social events.

Having a “safe space” I can go to when I feel overloaded.


The problem? I still miss the signs in time. That’s what this tool is for  -it would track physiological + sensory changes and send an early warning so I can act before it’s too late.

I want blunt feedback:

Would this help you?

What situations would make it most useful?

Any reasons it wouldn’t help you?

I thought having to regulate everyone else’s emotions to the detriment of my own could potentially be temporary. But I now see I was naively hopeful. Shifts in perception the size required for society to accept my authenticity happen in tiny phases much longer than my lifetime.

1mnms79,"This is the first chapter of a novel I'm working on. I need your opinions on it. The main character is ADHD and there are other autistic and disabled characters as well. It's 2,700 words.","My name is Imogen Maisie Lambert, and I am eighteen years old. Some of my favorite things in the world are good food, music, and my friends. Something I do not like is doing things that make me uncomfortable.

I sit on my hands to keep them from shaking. I’ve done a few interviews before. We all have, but no matter how many I do or how much I practice my responses in the mirror, I will never feel comfortable in front of a camera.

The interview studio is spacious. Behind us is a white wall, and in front are the camera crews. Each one stares at us like we are some freak show. I know that’s not what they are doing, but that’s what it feels like. Their eyes bore into my skin, making the panic in my chest grow. I will always hate interviews. They make me antsy.

Next to me is my best friend Ji-won, the perfect example of a glacier that melts for the right people. He seems cold on the outside, but is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet. His long black hair reaches his shoulders. The top half is tied back so it doesn’t hang in his face. He always hated how it felt. I don’t blame him. I hate it too.

Neither of us enjoys the interviews. Out of the five of us, we hate it the most.

I fidget in my seat. I try not to, but usually I can’t stop. I like moving and keeping busy. The cushion of the chair under me squeaks, so I stop moving.

When the interviewer finally comes in, I plaster a fake smile on my face. I know I will probably enjoy the interview once it starts, but it’s always frightening at the beginning. All the cameras flash on. This is when the magic starts to happen.

The whole group, except for Myth, stands as the interviewer comes closer. Myth is the sort of person who will only talk when she has something important to say. Most of the time, the important things she says are making fun of the rest of us.

The interviewer is a tall man with a belly that hangs over his belt. His shirt is tucked in, but it is coming out of his pants. I take a deep breath to calm myself.

The interviewer holds out his hand to each of us. When it’s my turn, I take it reluctantly. I do not enjoy shaking hands with random people, but it’s considered polite. I can see Ji-won wiping his hands on his pants after shaking the interviewer’s hand. He doesn’t realize he does it. It’s just something his brain does automatically.

“It’s really good to have you all here today.” The interviewer has a bright smile that fills his face. He must really enjoy what he does. Good for him. It’s important to enjoy what you spend your life doing.

Our group’s leader, Tao Kaiser, nodded enthusiastically. He always takes over the interviews. He’s good with them. He’s good with people.

“We’re really happy to be here. Thank you for inviting us on your show.” Tao tucks a stray hair under his beanie. He always wears that hat. No one knows why it’s just what he does. No one in the group questions him about it anymore. We’re all quirky in our own ways. That’s what makes us such a great team. Take me, for example, I have ADHD. I learned about ADHD when I was diagnosed. I was ten. People always say that it’s bad to label yourself with things like ADHD or autism, but I disagree. I would rather be labeled as ADHD than ‘too much’ or a ‘freak’. I’m not a freak. I’m just me.

The interviewer’s voice makes my head shoot up. I need to pay attention, but all the cameras and lights keep catching my attention.

“So why don’t you introduce yourselves for those who don’t know you yet?”

Tao nods along with the interviewer. “Of course. We are Hidden Mosaic. I am Tao, the leader of this fine group. Uh…” He looks at each of us, trying to read our minds.

“I’m Callaway, but you can just call me Cal.” Even sitting down, he was considerably taller than the rest of us. Cal is just your typical moody artist. He always has his head in the clouds even more than I do. He’s talented in pretty much any skill he’s ever tried.

The interviewer nodded along with each person.

“Hi, I’m Mackenzie Banks. Call me Myth.” Her voice was low and steady. Nothing fazed Myth. You can always count on her.

Next is my turn. I take a deep breath and introduce myself.

“It’s your girl, Imogen.” I hold my hands up in a pose and pause. “And this is Ji-won. It’s really good to be here today. We are all so excited to be answering your questions.” I talk with my hands a lot.

The interviewer seemed to like my overly friendly introduction.

Ji-won nods his thanks. He rarely participates in activities like this. He often gets overwhelmed, and his ability to talk disappears. We’re all used to it now, but it can still cause issues with other people. He talks when he wants to talk, not when others want him to. It’s funny. People who don’t know him well say he’s quiet and shy. He’s not. Trust me. Ji-won is super loud when he’s comfortable.

As the interviewer and Tao share a joke, I start to tap my foot on the ground. My fidgeting is normal for me. It‘s normal for the whole group. We all fidget in our own ways.

The interviewer adjusted his seat. “Alright, let’s start with the questions. How did you all first meet, and how did you decide to form a group?”

Tao leans back and rests his arm on the chair like he’s relaxed. “I have known Ji-won since we were little boys.”

“Myth and I are siblings, so we’ve always known each other. Then she and Imogen became friends.” Cal smiles brightly as he takes the lead after Tao.

I open my mouth and speak. “Me, Cal, and Myth have been friends since elementary school. When we were in high school, we met Tao and Ji-won. We’ve all been great friends after that.” I didn’t mention the reason we met Tao and Ji-won was because of the bullying. They had helped the three of us when we were outnumbered. High school wasn’t a pleasant place for any of us.

Ji-won just stares ahead. I look over and meet his eyes. He looks away. I mouth *okay* in a way the cameras wouldn’t catch.

He nods back and mouths *tired*. Aren’t we all. We stayed up way too late the previous night talking on the phone about our upcoming tour. Everything with the group happened so fast. No one was expecting us to blow up in popularity so quickly.

“It was even more amazing when we found out all of us loved music. It was destiny, I guess, for us to be together.” Tao smiles as he looks at each of us. He always acts like a parent when we’re together. It’s funny because he’s only a few years older. He has an old soul.

“Tao,” the interviewer says. “I’m assuming you’re the oldest because you’re the leader.”

“Oh yes,” he laughs, “I’m the oldest thought sometimes you wouldn’t be able to tell.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well,” he goes on. “Myth is very mature and often takes care of things if I can’t.”

“I’m the second oldest,” Myth adds.

“Can you point out who is oldest to youngest?” The interviewer pushes his hair behind his ear.

“You know I’m the oldest, and Myth is after me.”

I can’t help but shout out the rest of the answer. “I’m third and in the middle. After me is Ji-won, and Cal is the youngest of us.” People can usually tell he’s the youngest. Not because he acts immature, but by how we treat him. No matter how old he gets, he will always be a little kid to us.

Cal grins as I point to him. He stands and bows dramatically. “That’s me, the baby of the group.”

I burst out laughing. Cal is also one of the funniest. Thankfully, everyone else starts laughing as well. This wouldn’t have been the first time I started laughing at something that wasn’t funny. I can’t help it. I laugh when I’m nervous.

The interviewer smiles politely. “You are the youngest Cal, but also the tallest, is that right?”

He nods. “I’m the tallest by a lot.”

I jump to my feet and stand next to him. “I’m the second tallest.” Even so, Cal towers over me.

“Let’s have everyone stand and compare height.” The interviewer gets to his feet and waits for the rest of the group to follow. Tao stands next to me. He is only a tiny bit shorter. I love rubbing it in his face.

“After Tao is Myth, and Ji-won is the shortest.” I quickly fill in before the interviewer asks Myth to stand. Sometimes the interviewers don’t realize she is disabled and ask her to do something she physically can’t do. It makes it awkward for everyone.

“So Ji-won, how does it feel to be the shortest on the team? Do the others joke about it with you?” The interviewer looks straight at him. I prevented one awkward encounter only to come face to face with another. This is one of the reasons I hate interviews.

I wait a moment before injecting myself into the conversation again. I hope I’m not being annoying. “We don’t tease him that much. If anything, we tease Cal about being so tall.” Everyone laughs thankfully. Even some of the camera crew get a kick out of it. One of my talents is making people laugh. I don’t know how it just happens. I say something and people find it funny.

I try to pay attention as the interviewer asks another question from his Q cards.

“What was the inspiration behind the latest album?”

Tao takes over this one. “We wanted our second album, Glass Heart, to be a bit of each of us. We wanted it to be relatable and make people think and feel. We like it when we can help comfort people without music. Music is what brings people together. It’s what brought us together.”

I mumble yes in agreement. Music is like glue. It holds the broken pieces together. “That’s where our name came from. Hidden mosaic. Mosaics are pieces of beautifully crafted art made from broken glass. We wanted our music to show that. Broken things can be beautiful. There is beauty in imperfection. The hidden part in the name means that sometimes those imperfections are hidden away because of embarrassment or shame. That’s sad. No one should hide away a part of themselves just because of embarrassment.”

I shut up, realizing I’ve been talking for way too long. My face grows red.

“Ya, Imogen, you’re right.” Cal picks up where I stopped. “Imperfection is beautiful, which is why it shouldn’t be hidden away. I mean, we have a lot of problems. We’re human. But there is nothing wrong with that.”

“I love your message to the world.” The interviewer looked down at his Q cards. “So you would like to make people feel comforted and accepted with your music?”

“Yes.” Ji-won rocks side to side as he talks. “Yes.”

I smile without meaning to. I can’t help but be proud that he talked. Interviews are always uncomfortable, and they make him super nervous. He tilts his head to the side slightly and brushes the hair from his face. Our eyes meet again. He seems relaxed from what I can see. He’s hard to read. I struggle with knowing what’s going on inside his head. I think he may struggle to know what goes on in his head as well, so I don’t feel too bad.

The interviewer looks up from his cards. “Is everyone doing all right so far?”

I confidently say yes. Everyone else nods.

“I’ll keep asking questions then. Just let me know if anyone needs a break.” The interviewer takes a sip of water before continuing. “Oh, this is a good one. How would you describe your role on stage and off?”

“So I’m the good-looking one,” I say without thinking. My face grows red as I process what I just said. Nervously, I fiddle with my ear. Everyone laughs, so I don’t think too much of it.

“Actually, I’m the good-looking one,” Myth fights back.

Before we can get into an argument about who is better looking that Myth would win, Tao interrupts. “We all sing. That’s one of our favorite things to do. We all write the lyrics and music as well. We help each other out in almost every aspect.”

“And you and I are the rappers of the group.” Cal buts in. “We can also both play bass.”

“Tao, Ji-won, and Myth are amazing on the guitar. I wish I could play like they do.” I couldn’t keep the smile off my face when talking about my friend’s achievements. They were truly amazing.

“And Imogen is our drummer. We would be so lost without her.” Tao smiles at me. It always warms my heart when he gives compliments. He really takes care of us. I don’t know where we would be without him.

“And what about off the stage?” The interview asks.

“Tao acts like a worried parent.” I spurt out.

Everyone agrees.

Cal nods. “100% we can’t do anything without him, getting worried we’ll get hurt.”

Tao looks us up and down. “The last time I didn’t worry, you climbed a tree and broke your ankle because you fell.”

“Hey!”

“Or that time we left you in charge of…”

“Oh, okay, okay. Fine, fine.” Cal pushes himself farther into the back of the chair.

I laugh along with everyone else.

“Tao is the parent, and Cal is the one who always gets into trouble,” The interviewer adds to keep the conversation going.

“Actually, Imogen gets in the most trouble.” Myth raises her eyebrows at me, taunting.

I would fight it, but she’s right. “Ya, I do. I’m the most clumsy and forgetful. I often find myself in odd situations that would never happen to a normal person.”

“And what would that be?”

“Next question!” I shout with laughter. It wasn’t really that bad, but not saying what it was makes it even more interesting.

The interviewer covers his mouth with his hand to stop laughing. “Okay, we’ll move on. You guys all seem really close. Are any of the dating allegations going around true?”

I feel my heart stop. I’ve seen some of the allegations online, but I always ignored them.

“People are saying Tao and Myth are dating, and that Imogen and Ji-won are dating. Is there any truth to these?”

“No.” Myth’s answer was blunt and straight to the point. “None of us is dating each other.”

“Even Imogen and Ji-won?” He pries. “You seem rather close.”

I feel my face growing hot. Why do people always assume that if a girl and a guy are close that they are dating? Girls and guys can be friends without there being any romance between them. I can’t stand that everyone in this world cares so much about romance. There are more important things than a boyfriend.

“No, Ji-won and I aren’t dating. We are soulmates, best friends.” I look at Ji-won.

His face was blank. I waited for some sort of reaction to know I said the right thing. He nodded. That was as much as I would get here.

The interviewer, noticing the tension he created, stood. “Let’s take a break and get some food. After we can continue the interview.”

I nod along with everyone. Of course, my mind wanders, and I don’t notice everyone was leaving the set until Ji-won gently taps my shoulder. I look up at him. He tilts his head towards the others.

“Hungry?”

I nod. I’m always hungry. He knows that. Food is the way to my heart, along with good music, of course.",1754940918.0,5,7,autism,autism

1mnkavt,My apathy and empathy with autism is so weird,"I don’t feel a lot of grief when a loved one passes. I know I’ll grieve when my father, mother, sister (hopefully I’ll go before her cause I’m older) and dogs die, but for grandparents I’m always kinda like “yeah that’s sad but they’re old and it was their time” yk? I hate how apathetic I am when someone I love dies but that’s just how I am. Like people expect me to be grieving and super sad meanwhile I go to the funeral or memorial and continue living my life. I cried a bit when one of my grandparents died because we were super close and I lived with her for six years, but I got over it fairly quickly. In fact the only sadness i feel about her death now is when my dad gets random waves of grief and it makes me sad cause I know he misses his mom.

But that being said, I completely flip the switch when a friend’s loved one dies. Like I’m out here baking cookies for them and writing a card and dropping it off and totally understanding why they’re sad or grieving or needing space. Like there’s no disconnect. 

But when someone close to me dies I kinda feel like a robot sometimes and that upsets me. It’s less of a mourning and more of a “why aren’t I mourning?” kind of thing and that’s the only thing that makes my life difficult when someone passes. It’s not even like I’m so sad that I’m turning my emotions off cause I feel like I’m able to enjoy most things normally and only feel bad when I’m with another grieving person (like we both lost the same loved one) and they’re in shambles while I’m out here living my life.

Anyone else feel that kind of disconnect? 

I’ve learned to live with it and I understand it doesn’t make me a bad person or anything and it doesn’t say anything about the love I’ve held for someone, but it’s something that still makes me go “huh” sometimes.",1754935303.0,6,2,autism,autism
1mnlqv3,"Keeping a job as an autistic person with depression, anxiety and complex trauma. Bullied in previous workplace.","I just don’t understand. I’m great at my job. My psychologist agrees with my perspective along with other charge nurses (I am a mental health nurse) and my new union rep. I have been treated with contempt by a supervisor which I had evidence about and almost a discrimination concern - my supervisor was getting to avoid me and treat me differently from others because the senior charge nurse said he is “not confident” in managing people with issues but the newest charge nurse could... I’m not a menace at work, I’m very fair and care about people being treated with respect. I have previous workplace bullying which was for the same kind of thing, I seemed to be just scapegoated. That went on for almost two years and it has legitimately traumatised me. Besides the fact that my current supervisor is a mental health nurse, my only requirement to keep me feeling safe in the workplace is to be valued like everyone else. This briefly resolved after me reporting it however I didn’t get a satisfactory response despite the fact I have full on evidence. My union at the time also contacted my senior charge nurse without my knowledge and advised him I had a case (turns out that union rep and my senior charge nurse knew each other). Anyway… issue has arisen again. My supervisor once again is treating me differently - refusing to sort my rota which he has been doing for others and when I made him aware that I knew he was doing this for others he said “because they asked me” and I was like “well I’m asking you”. I’m once again off my work and medicating myself with quetiapine to try and keep myself asleep. I have a new union, rep who has validated my experience and encouraged me to seek early resolution. I made a clear email to the band 8 manager and got a response “I don’t know what it is you are seeking early resolution about?”. I just am sick of being gaslit and I just can’t cope anymore. I know I am right, have the evidence and my managers know that me being treated unfairly exacerbates my depression, anxiety and complex trauma symptoms. I’ve had depression since I was 10 years old and I’m 30 now and I’m stuck. I love my job and I want to be there but it puts me in a state of devastation that my supervisor can’t treat me with the same respect, and neither can other managers who ignore my concerns.

1mn6kfj,Cats,"Hi everyone
Just wanted to share just how much I love cats, they have been my longest-sticking special interest after I really thought that depression and burnout took all the passion left in me.

I really wish you guys would know just how cool they are. Each distinct colour of cat has their own personality, the same way different dog breeds do. Did you also know that certain colours of cats cannot be certain sexes? I believe that 1 in 10 or 1 in a 100 orange cats are female, and that calico cats by default cannot be male, only female or intersex because of a biological phenomenon that I do not understand.

I like the ones that are cat shaped with the big ears. Did you know that the animal asthma is most prominent is, is cats? Other animals can have it too, for example horses, but for cats, their condition is specified as ‘feline asthma’ just because of how common it is in cats.

As a level 2/MSN autistic, I really do hope that one day they make it possible for cats to be service animals. I’d recently heard that a country has written this in law, and ever since then, I’ve been considering the feasability of implimenting this in the UK, and made me seriously consider whether or not I would benefit from a service animal. I have never until now really thought about it because of some trauma around dogs, but I am struggling enough on a daily basis that I think I would benefit from a service animal. One can only hope.

I am about to start school soon due to the tech bans I’ll no longer have my headphones. I want to not go to school anymore or just be alive at this point. It feels like I’m just living to suffer and nothing feels enjoyable anymore. Even reading or my special interests or just doomscrolling makes me feel horrible or I can’t concentrate on it. Every day feels shitty and like a struggle if I stay in the house I’m overstimulated because my grandma is going deaf and refuses to wear her hearing aids so she turns her phone and TV all the way up and we have to talk loudly when we speak to her. When I go outside I’m also overstimulated. School last year was horrible I was not okay throughout the entire year but second semester I absolutely crashed. I made myself overwhelmed to the point that I was physically sick and exhausted meltdowns/shutdowns every other day. I got sick to the point I would throw up or have a big enough of a meltdown that my parents let me stay home from school which just made me fall behind more. I know next year will be worse since it will be my last year I will have to do more and have more responsibilities. Im considering quitting swimming and robotics despite loving both because last year I couldn’t properly commit myself like I did previous year and made people worry about me and apparently I was very verbally aggressive though I wasn’t being irritable on purpose. I also don’t think going to school and back home everyday will help me either especially since my parents try to pressure me into continuing whatever I start.

And for me, it’s not just “ugh, it’s warm.” Warm means I’m stuck in shorts or linen, which means my legs have to be shaved smooth because of sensory issues. If I shave the night before, I’ve already got stubble the next day, which I cannot deal with. So these warm days are just summer’s final revenge before the cold saves me.

I thought about a time I was at a get together with someone and a lady I didn't know offered me something with meat in it, i declined and said I'm starting to be vegetarian and am trying to eat less meat and nothing more. I thought my tone was neutral, but she responded poorly and I was told I made her feel weird like I must have said that to insult her, even though I didnt say anything rude about the dish or act like it was disgusting or comment on those who did eat it.

Another time I told someone I was afraid of mascot characters because I always have been, and told a story that I thought would be funny about myself and how I sort of freaked out at a chuck-e-cheese party as a kid. They said ""seriously? All of them? Surely not all of them. I mean he's a cute mouse."" But..I said all of them, why wouldnt i mean all of them? Its just a fact about me. 

 In highschool someone lent me a book and I didnt really like it but since they lent it to me to read, I feel like i'd hurt their feelings if i didnt so I read it the whole way through, and a friend said ""you cant actually really read EVERY single thing someone gives you the entire way."" I said I do because they wanted me to and I want to make them happy even if they will or wont know i did or not, and they said I'm exaggerating to make myself look better, but I said nothing like that? 

In a movie theater when I was a kid I wanted to stay the entire way through the credits because my mom (also autistic) said maybe it'd be kind to the people who worked on it and the extras to read their names and acknowledge their hard work, because even subconsciously we can take in their names, so I just do that. My friend asked why I wanted tl stay so I said why in a cheerful tone and said I would catch up with them outside in a few minutes when its over. They said I didnt mean that and only said that to make them feel bad, but...I never stopped them from leaving and I just answered a question about my behavior? 

I just say things I do or think matter of factly, even when I dont elaborate or explain any percieved importance of my actions (i do sometimes, if someone is lacking info I think they might need, but I get that wrong too fairly often since tone is hard) but lots of people over time especially in childhood think i'm exaggerating and I'm not really sure what else I can do because explaining further always makes it 10x worse",1754933278.0,3,7,autism,autism

When we got to the fitting rooms, however, I realized that only one person was allowed in the room at a time, normally my mom goes in with me just to make sure everything fits correctly. I also learned that they ask for your name so they can put it outside the door. I tried the stuff on, and when I got done, the lady working there asked my mom if there was anything I didn’t like. I was so embarrassed, like you could have asked me! My mom wasn’t even waiting for me when I was trying the stuff on, she was a whole area away from me! I asked my mom why she lets my sister wear whatever she wants (her whole wardrobe consists of about five shirts and one pair of pants), and she said that my sister won’t go anywhere with her and hates shopping. Seriously? I only go clothes shopping to make you happy, not because I enjoy it. I just want to wear what I want, not something uncomfortable or ugly just so I can look my age. I suck at communicating verbally so I plan to just write, write, write about how much I hate clothes shopping! I’m so over it. ",1754958951.0,1,2,autism,autism
1mn8kpw,I made an impulsive decision and I don't regret it,"I really hate last minute plans because they can send me into full meltdowns. I usually refuse any plans if there isn't at least a 24h notice. But last night, at 10pm, I received a message from a friend asking if I wanted to go on a nocturnal hike. (I love love hiking) that day, it was far too hot outside, and the evening was fresh.

 To my own surprise I said yes. I half regretted right after sending the message but I told myself it'd be okay. It took a while to adjust, during the hike. I was not fully present for the first 45mins or so. But then we stopped to look at the stars, the sky was clear and the moon was so bright. We stopped on the way to look at some bugs and slugs. We heard an owl and we saw a badger!!!!! (I had never seen one!). 

The night was quiet, and at the end of the hike, we stopped in a field with tall grass and looked at the stars in silence for a good 20min. At that moment I saw an enormous shooting star tearing through the sky!! I was so so happy and impressed. It was fresh, quiet, and almost magical. So I absolutely don't regret saying yes and going outside of my routine. Sometimes it's nice.

1mnoh5e,My experience with asking my doc for diagnosis after scoring enough[highly probable]on online tests,"I am already diagnosed for adhd and some other mental illnesses  and I have been having some problems with MPH, I read from some sources that this could be from AuDHD, apart from that I had been researching autism because when I read the masking symptoms for the first time, almost my entire life began to click in, so i finally after I don't know how many weeks gathered the courage to ask the doc for a formal autism diagnosis after our main conversation about adhd was done 

I tried to translate it as good as I could 

Me: sir i had this one concern 
Him: yeah?
Me:could you write me up for an autism test
Him: *grins 
Why?
Me:sir i had recently been reading about autism as many articles pointed out that the behaviour i feel from the adhd meds is quite similar to what audhd people feel from it,and a lot-
Him: *interuptingly, it was ruled out the moment you walked in through this door, you can't be autistic, i recognise autism the moment I see it(actually said this line), so I can also see who doesn't have autism, you don't need any assesment of any sort, assesment is given to those, which we first think, have autism, then the symptoms are matched, why would we do that with you when you're not one to begin with
Me: sir but there is masking-
Him: *interrupts again, masking is nothing, autism is autism, it's very apparent always, 
Me:sir ,but ,just to be on a safe side-
Him:okay,so, let's assume, I give you a diagnosis and do have autism, what now? You're already under treatment ( I am under treatment for adhd) what would be the point of It? The treatment won't change,so why bother
Me: i could be a little aware of myself, probably abstain-
Him: it doesn't matter, you go anywhere, no scale of autism will diagnose you as autistic,and stop using Google
Me: sir i didn't use Google i read actual books and articles
Him: those books and articles are not for you 

It was really embarrassing and the confidence that had taken months of therapy to build was instantly shattered, I wanted to cry right at that moment but i simply left and I couldn't look into anyone's face again on my way back home, like the old  times

1mnqvzh,How will I ever find a partner?,"Just wanted to start out by saying that I am a straight male.

This will probably sound like some lonely, sad post, but it is a real honest one and I really hope I can get some solid answers. I have always told myself that I will never be able to find a partner, and It's not just because I am insecure, but there are many more difficulties I will face. 

First of all, I am celibate, and that rules out basically 99.9% of potential partners as they won't find satisfaction from me, unless they also are celibate. And second of all, I am obviously on this sub, and I am a bit of a wreck with people. I only have one true friend who I have had for the past 11 years and have never been able to make relationships with other people. If I were to have a partner they would likely also have to be neurodivergent.

On top of this, I hope it doesn't come off as arrogant, but I definitely want a partner who is actually my type rather than scraping anything I can get, one that really attracts me both outside and inside, and that alone is just going to be impossible to find.

So In conclusion, I really don't know if I will ever be able to find a partner. I'm not gonna be depressed or anything if I don't, I'm a really happy person who doesn't need a partner to change that, but the more I think about it the more I want it.

1mn7jwt,Being interested in people,"I'm a 39 year old male who was diagnosed with ASD a couple of years ago. Ever since I’ve been trying to figure out what aspects of my personality are related to autism and what aspects are not.

I’ve always had a hard time having one to one conversations with people. I have a couple of friends with whom I’m comfortable enough, but especially building new connections is generally awkward at best for me.

One of the biggest problems is probably that I look and act quite neurotypical on a surface level. I don’t have any special interests that are typically associated with neurodivergence. I like to socialize, I can manage small talk to a certain extent. I think that’s why people expect me to keep behaving like an neurotypical. It’s like seeing a person walking normally. You don’t expect them to suddenly start limping when they start running.

I was on a first date yesterday with someone I met through a dating app. The whole time I was thinking the date was going well right until the end where I got some signals that she has no intentions of seeing me again. I’ve been thinking about our interactions during the date and analyzing them about what she probably expected of me. 

I think my main issue is that I don’t convey enough interest in people. That is both true in a dating setting and a non dating one. It’s not that I’m not interested, it’s just that I really struggle to ask people questions about themselves. I’m insecure about boundaries in regard to what is and isn’t appropriate to ask a person you don’t know yet. That often results in me just listening to what they volunteer to tell and not asking follow up questions. In fact, the follow up questions I could have asked aften don’t occur to me until long after the conversation.

My instinct was to address it directly but politely — but it escalated, and I ended up having to put myself physically in between both the autistic person and another person for safety reasons. I gave those involved some context about the person’s neurodivergence so they could respond more fairly

Now I’m feeling conflicted. I understand that sometimes we do things without realising they might be disruptive or uncomfortable to others — but I also feel like if no one gives that feedback, the person might just continue thinking it’s fine and that other people are always in the wrong

How do you handle this tension between:

1mniljq,Struggling to speak to other people,"Hello,

I seem to have problems speaking to anyone but my safe person(my boyfriend). It isn't a mental block kind of thing(at least I think so?), but rather my speech gets worse and I suddenly forget a lot of words.

Now that I also had to move to a different country, it has only gotten worse: I also started to make tons of grammar mistakes and can't say the simplest of sentences anymore, sometimes not even lone words. That would seem logical at first but as seen when I'm by myself or talking to my boyfriend, I am very proficient in the local language. 

I do have a lot of anxiety but not with the friends I made here, so it doesn't make sense for me to blame it only on my anxiousness.

I'm also new to finding out im Autistic, I unfortunately went through my childhood undiagnosed. So I'm wondering if this could be skill regression? Because I noticed that not only my other languages - I speak 4 in total - have gotten worse, but my speech overall degraded.

TLDR: Can't speak properly to anyone but my safe person and my speech in general has gotten worse.

I will give a few examples: 
Recently I had ACL surgery and had to walk on crutches, one of her friends kept taking them when I sat down and just left them somewhere
So I couldn’t walk with them when they left for class. 
When my friend who has the same interest as me wanted to sit next to me they pulled her away and said with a disgusted face: “why would you sit there/next to her?”

Once we were in the elevator together and they talked about my friends birthday coming up. They said they wanted to go to a cat cafe and then her friends said: “I’m so happy we finally get to do something just the three of us!” 

We were four people with me in the elevator.

One time, I was with my parents and did this.  I went up to the stand and the guy said ""We're raising money to give autistic kids iPads!""  When I told the guy I'm autistic, he looked me up and down, like he had never seen an (high functioning) autistic person who dressed well.  Then he literally said to me, ""Oh, hi!  What's your experience with autism?  Is it ADHD?""  It's so ridiculous that people begging for money for this organization wouldn't know enough about autism to know that it's not the same thing as ADHD, or an umbrella term for all neurodiverse conditions.

My dad told him ""Shouldn't \*you\* be donating money to \*me\* for raising an autistic child?""  It was hilarious.

On a side note, the whole idea of this organization is odd, because they didn't specify that the iPads are for non-verbal kids to communicate or anything.

1mncjbl,Father of autistic 5 year old boy UK,"Hi Guys

  
Bit of a long winded post so apologies. Not even sure what I am asking or wanting but here goes.

  
My son is 5, we got him diagnosed early as all the signs were there and we just knew (well mainly his mother knew and I agreed after research. He was ignoring his name, spinning, saying very few words, flapping hands etc. At present he says 1/2 words together and can say a lot of words, some of them very specific but mainly nouns, no like 'I want drink' just 'drink'. He verbally stims more than flapping now, will still jump and bend knees when excited. His concentration time is poor, he will stay for a while if interested otherwise moves on to the next thing. Danger awareness practically non existent, will walk off towards roads, the sea if on holiday etc. He is not bad at following instruction (if he wants to of course). We think there may be ADHD in there which we will get diagnosed and possibly take medicine for if we think it will help him concentrate and learn.

He is in a resource provision class, so its a specialist setting but attached to a mainstream school. Specialist school said he wasn't high need enough. He has also moved up within the setting which is great.

  
I am just wondering if anyone has been through similar with their child regards ADHD/ similar traits and if so what happened and how are they doing now? I really hope he will be able to be dependent but its our constant worry as ASD parents isn't it...

1mnaw7w,How do I build confidence and make connections as a late-diagnosed autistic woman?,"So I (31F) got a late diagnosis of autism a couple of years ago now. Ever since, I’ve been going along to a local autistic women’s group to try and meet some likeminded people. I notice that I really struggle to talk in groups, even when I want to. Partly it’s fear of interrupting people and partly its slower processing speed. 

I actually had someone ask me at the most recent meetup whether I benefit from someone else trying to bring me into the conversation, which I really appreciated. No one has ever thought to do this with me before. It does make me feel a bit rubbish about myself though, because I’m still heavily masking, even around other neurodivergent people. It’s tricky because there are some really dominant personalities in that group and I often can’t get a word in edgeways, but it does also make me wonder if this is the reason that I struggle so much with friendships - maybe other people find talking to me a lot of hard work because I say so little. My whole life, I’ve had people say that I was unusually shy/ quiet. But in my case, it’s down to reticence rather than not having anything I want to say/ contribute. I strongly believe that it’s a response to trauma (severe bullying and abuse for being autistic) for me. But the question is how do I ever overcome this and make friends/ connections with people? I’ve become increasingly isolated in the last few years and barely interact with anyone on a day to day basis. I do have a very negative view of people in general due to past experiences so find it hard to put myself out there, especially in majority NT groups. I have this constant paranoia that others are judging me negatively wherever I go, in any interaction. I really believe that autism and social anxiety don’t go all the way to explaining my lifelong difficulties forming acquaintances/ friendships, because many autistic people I’ve met don’t seem to struggle as much with this as I do. I do tend to do better at 1 to 1 conversations but I worry I’m still off-putting to others somehow. 

Other autistic people also seem to be a lot more comfortable with others (friends, at work, etc) knowing they’re autistic. But after being bullied and abused my whole life for showing autistic traits, I will generally do anything in my power to protect myself from other people knowing about my diagnosis. Maybe that drives people away too because then I’m just “weird”?

I was unsure where to post this or how to tag it because so many tags match the problem (communication, sensory issues, social struggles, semiverbal, and comorbidities). 

I have autism (diagnosed)/I am autistic. I'm 31, and I have a speech disorder that I don't know the name of, but I'm sure it's part of autism for me. Regardless of whether it's related, I'm about ready to lose my sh!t.

My voice is loud to me. I swear that I am talking at the same volume as everyone else, yet hardly anyone can hear me. I try to be heard. I try so hard, but the louder I get, the less control I have over the tone of my voice. I either sound flat, bored, or angry. I'm feeling angry and lost and helpless. I know that the majority of the world is not deaf or hard of hearing. I know that it's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me.

I've been researching speech therapy, and it sounds good, right? Nope, sorry. I live in a rural area, and the nearest speech therapist is two hours away, and to top it off, there's only 3 of them, and 2 of them exclusively work with children.

We thought that it was a confidence thing, but even when I feel confident, nobody can hear me. That's regardless of the other person's age or hearing ability. Even when I get mad and think that I'm yelling (and literally hurting my own ears), it's just a normal speaking voice/volume to everyone else.

For anyone else who has a soft voice, is there anything that you've done to make your voice louder (other than the obvious ""just be louder!"" because clearly if that worked, I wouldn't be here)?

1mngpe5,Why won’t my mom care!!!,"I nagged her for so long to help me redye my hair but she used the same words every time I remind her it’s time to do it: “I don’t feel like it” or “tomorrow.” I got so frustrated of her excuses and I need to start preparing for school so I applied a redye last night. She comes into the bathroom at 1 am asking me if I know what I’m doing. “Do you want to help me now?” I ask her. “No, it’s too late.”
 “Then just let me do it.” 

You don’t care about helping me do the redye and then are reluctant to let me do it myself. Well I’m not gonna wait for you and tolerate your excuses anymore. They’re driving me mad. For some reason even though I obviously care about it and need to get it done you always find that watching tv is more important than helping me out for 20 mins. And when I do it myself, it takes like an hour and a half. Still, I think it’s more convenient to do it for an hour and half then rely on you.

Well I ended up staining the sink and luckily it isn’t too bad but I definitely need to get rid of it. Now instead of preparing for school I’m stuck frantically trying to find ways to get the dye out!!!

1mng5ho,How do I actually get the help I need?,"I'm tired. So so tired. 

I'm tired of being told it gets better, because when? When I'm 50? When I've finally figured everything out alone which clearly isn't happening. 

Even if someone could just discuss through what I'm saying and actually listen to me not just tell me I'm being defeatists. I have genuine responses to people's solutions, genuine concerns and worries that I'd like to discuss through, but because I'm suicidal everyone just brushes them off like it's just the depressed side of me talking. 

God I'm TRYING. I'm EXHAUSTED. When you need more time than is physically possible to rest and recover from your job, how do you ever get anything done?

That's a GENUINE question. I'm not looking for someone to jokingly relate and tell me they struggle with time too. I'm looking for an actual answer. Not ""you make time"" an actual answer. 

I'm tired of being told to figure everything out alone. I know myself WELL. Extremely well in fact. But my autistic brain won't put 2 and 2 together to figure things out. I genuinely need help, genuine conversation. To the point, specific conversation, not blind hope. Not being told it will get better. Not being told I'll figure things out, because honestly as long as I'm left to figure things out alone I won't. 

Everyone's needs are different, and one of my needs is to actually be helped and guided through the struggles I'm having, not told to figure it all out myself. 

Yes, I'm aggressive and irritable. I've been struggling for YEARS with the only response being ""it will get better, stay strong, you'll figure it out"" 

So like, don't say that stuff, show me you understand why I'm struggling so much, and maybe I won't be so irritable with you. Don't act like the struggles are just in my head. Don't act like this is all just a phase and time is magically gonna make it go away. 

I don't need therapy, I don't need to be given coping methods. I need someone to understand where I'm at and understand it can get better, not through coping, but through someone having a genuine conversation with me and helping me/guiding me through my next steps until I'm out of the mess I accidentally created myself.

I looked at him confused and then he said ""It's right here"" and then motioned his head towards it. I responded saying ""Yeah it's right there"" to which he said that he couldn't because he was petting my cat. I still stopped the playing episode and then when I began to walk away he turned the TV off himself. It's a small thing I know but why the hell could he not do that himself? I'm so tired of this because now my sisters will be saying things like ""\[My name\] can you get that please?"" or when I'm grabbing myself a snack they'll ask me to grab some as well.

1mnlcum,29 F 26 M,"My boyfriend and I are having ongoing issues. I keep running back to the relationship and it isn't good. I don't understand why I keep doing that. A recent injury has brought up our past issues. 

He fell and broke his arm really bad. I've been doing everything I can to help. I took him to the ER. Drove him 1.5 hours to his appointment. Then got his prescription. I've been trying to cook and buy him things so he can heal. 

Unfortunately, we are having issues we've had before regarding chores. He can't do the chores now and I understand. So I've been trying. Right before he broke his arm. I cleaned the litter boxes because he was upset he usually does that job. I looked up online and it said I did all the right steps to clean the litter boxes but they were stinky. He got very upset about that and was very upset with me. I also moved them to a new location to try to make it easier for him to walk around. He was very upset about that so I moved them back. But he went on about it for a long time. 

Over the summer I've been really trying to step it up to clean. But I feel that he just kinda gives up and only does spurts of cleaning every week or 2 weeks. I really struggle due to an Autism and ADHD diagnosis. But I really try. I was struggling to do the dishes since we were out of town for his surgery. We got back and I felt completely dehydrated and exhausted and needed to rest. I didn't understand he was so upset about the dishes. He indirectly brought them up saying there are flies in the kitchen. Then all the sudden the next day or so he yelled at me and told me to do the dishes. Then he said he regretted all the cleaning he ever did in the apartment. It really hurt my feelings. I tried to talk to him again and he said he has a right to express his pain. He said something similar before like he has a right to express his anger. But this feels like an excuse to yell and not treat me right. 

To add to our stress, his cat peed on the bathroom rug during this conversation. So I picked up the rug and threw it away. He was upset I was trying confront him and threw the trash can near me. 

This is a repeated issue because 2 other times in the last few months when he was upset he beat the metal trash can up and destroyed it while his fists got bloodied. I told him I feel unsafe and had his parents come get him. 

When I say I'm going to step it up and clean her doesn't say he's going to step it up to make me feel safe. Instead he called me manipulative and like a 10 year old. I know he is going through a lot. His family and my family knows about everything that happened. His family says he just need time to rest , which I understand. I just have been crying for days because of this event.

Unfortunately, Texas has seen fit to completely ban the use of cell phones, smart watches, etc in school from the time they walk into the building until the time they leave, not even allowing for them to be used during lunch and in between classes. The school is asking me to try to figure this out with them and together we came up with the idea of using white noise instead of music, so we're trying to find headphones that we can load tracks onto rather than streaming via bluetooth and I will load white noise sounds onto them rather than music.

There was a post made here about 3 years ago that I found linking a couple of devices but those devices no longer seem to be sold, so I was hoping someone might know of some headphones (over the ear) which are still available today that can store tracks to be played offline. The phones get powered off and locked in a box by the school at the start of the day, so it's fine if the headphones \*support\* Bluetooth, but we need to be able to keep the tracks stored locally on the headphones so that he can listen to white noise.

1mn7cmb,My mindset is locked in believing that women don’t want a relationship with me due to being autistic.,"Hello everyone, 

I’m a 25-year-old man navigating through life as a single individual. Fortunately, I have a decent job with solid benefits but face unique challenges. I have been diagnosed with high-functioning autism, generalized seizures, and ADHD, which sometimes feels like a complex triangle of chaos that defines my existence.

I often notice many beautiful women in and out of the office in my work environment. While some are in relationships, others are single—just like me. Unfortunately, I find myself at the center of workplace gossip. My demeanor sometimes comes across as angry, unintentionally pushing people away, making them hesitant to approach me. This path has led to feelings of loneliness, sadness, and even depression. I often wear a mask of approval, concealing my genuine emotions from those around me. It pains me deeply that others perceive only the surface, not understanding the turmoil beneath.

Emotionally, I often feel like a turtle retreating into its shell, engaging in self-talk to muster assurance for no real reason. To distract myself from these overwhelming feelings, I immerse myself in video games, anime, YouTube, and my visits to the beach, where I seek solace and clarity.

I yearn for a long-term relationship with someone who sees and loves me for who I am inside. Yet, a nagging voice tells me such a connection may never happen. Despite that, I hold onto hope, reminding myself never to give up because there is always light at the end of the tunnel. However, the shadows of doubt often linger nearby.

Jessica, 32

My whole life I've felt like a prey animal. Anything unfamiliar causes anxiety, stress and fear. New people, new places, new sights, sounds and smells take me getting to know them thoroughly, on my own terms, before I can trust them. I don't remember when I first started masking, but I know why I do. I mask so I don't stand out. I mask so I don't get reprimanded or cause conflict. I mask so I seem 'normal'. I mask to blend in and hide in plain sight. If I act just like everyone else, then I am safe from being singled out, made fun of, bullied or targeted by predators. I mask so I can meet what is expected of me, even if I can't actually meet those expectations.
I mask around my family, my friends, acquaintances and strangers, and of course they are all different; like I've taken a one woman show on the road. I feel like I've been doing it for so long, that I've lost my core self and my life so far has just been a series of skins i wear. It makes me doubt who I am and what I am good at. It makes me feel like a hollow matryoschka doll, or a puppeteer-less puppet sometimes. The painful irony, is that it hasn't even worked. It's like I'm in the uncanny valley, and people don't seek out genuine relationships with me when I think they are. It's a lonely place to be.
I don't know how to untangle myself from this habit, it's my nature at this point. I think that the first step is to try to be aware when you do it, and to avoid repeating that behaviour. It's not only harmful to how you see yourself and your boundaries, but it's exhausting too. What helps me the most so far, is being too tired to do it and allowing myself to be vulnerable. Talking to myself and giving myself advice as if I am my own best friend or gentle parent also helps.
I don't know what being myself fully looks like, but it doesn't have to look the same all the time. I think I must just make my own mental space to be myself, and take that everywhere with me. I think I also need to prioritize my own expectations of myself, above others' expectations of me. Because being yourself, is okay. Being yourself lets others be themselves.

1mmtqyz,[CW: Suicide] I'm really struggling and I don't know if it gets better,"Hey everyone. This is my first time posting here, I've been diagnosed since 2020. I always felt like there was something different about me, but I could never tell what it was. I've also felt very isolated from other people my age, as well as my family. I've had a few friends growing up, but I had three very close friends, one of whom became my best friend and girlfriend, and the other two friends were like brothers to me. Unfortunately, the oldest friend took his own life in 2016, my girlfriend was killed by a drunk driver in 2017, and the last friend I had from that group took his life in 2020. 

Since then, I've never felt right, I feel like they were the only ones who ever understood me, and life is much more difficult without them. In high school, I attempted suicide after a particularly bad fight with my parents, who emotionally and physically abused me my whole life, I've had struggles with depression, and I also have really bad anxiety that is debilitating at times. But I recently moved across the country, and I feel so isolated again, and things got particularly bad recently, and I attempted suicide again by pulling out in front of a semi truck.

1mnhlts,"I do not have autistic symptoms, but I relate to autistic people too much","I'm not sure if this post is allowed here, but here goes.

I'm currently going into my third year of college. I thought I was normal till I started to try dating. I've only been on 2 'dates', but I've hung out with girls 1-on-1, but it would always end up in her ghosting me or not wanting to talk to me anymore. I journaled, consulted online resources, consulted my friends, and tried again after 4 months and... same results.

This led me to a whole introspection journey, and I realized how nobody ever texted me first all through K-12 (except for asking for work). Other than for a year in middle school, I was always the 'extra' member in a friend group, since I would only get to know about things when I hung out with them in person; nobody would fill me in on the gossip. I realized that I spoke way faster than most people around me when I reached college since I was used to people talking over me in a group conversation. I also have had several mute phases, some lasting 2 years. I never felt like I fit in anywhere till I reached college, which is really surprising since I'm studying abroad, and people from that country like me more than people from my own (to the point most of them stopped inviting me in the first 2 weeks).

I relate to autistic people in the sense that I can sense I'm making a conversation worse, but I do not know why and everything I say makes it even more worse. I like 'childish' stuff, and don't like 'teenager' shows (the 18+ ones that everyone watches in High School) . My parents have always get annoyed at me for 'trying to stand out so much' when I'm just trying to find myself. I like to try things out that the majority dislikes, like not using Google Chrome or not blindly saying iPhones are the better phones, so I can decide for myself. 

Reading autistic symptoms, I had them as a child but I seemed to grow out of it by my teenage years, but I know that's not possible. I did a phone-call screening with my university's mental health services, and my answer was no to most questions, although they did mention they do not specialize in autism.

I assume it doesn't really affect me much when i initially get the feedback and then i cry in the bathroom or find myself feeling angry and overwhelmed about it for a few days. 

I haven't been with the company very long but everything was going well. All my reviews were coming back as mid to high satisfactory. I then found out via email that I got an extra review at a parent's request. (No warning about it and it generally doesn't bother me because i like the reviews as it gives me clear actionable things to work on). So, I go to look at my review and get happy and excited because i'm gotten my first good rating instead of being very high satisfactory (My first review was in the middle of satisfactory but the second was less than 0.1 away from being considered good).

It all goes downhill when I open up the review. Yes i have a good rating overall and I get max rating in most of the criteria they asess on but in 2 criteria they give me a 1 (The lowest possible rating). The 1's are in the way I ask questions, and student engagement/building rapport. I look to the comment on it and all it says is I encourage you not to wear dark glasses (Which are my prescription lenses to read and for my sensory issues) and to smile more (Which i try to start the lesson smiling but if i focus all my energy on smiling the student won't learn anything as I'll be focusing on smiling and body language and masking again).

  
I guess I just wrote this to vent and see if anyone relates. It feels identical to when i was on prac placement for my uni study and I thought everything was going great.... Then my lecturer calls me on one of the last days of prac and warns me that my review is going to be bad. I enquired into why and she said she hadn't been told why. That issue was a little more unique but it boils down to the same... I think i'm doing great. The student is provably learning lots (or i'm doing well at whatever the job itself is) then I get told actually you're shit. (I know that's not what they've said but it feels like that's what they've said). What makes it worse is that with the company this time I had an autism diagnosis and mentioned my sensory issues and my autism/adhd diagnosis during the interviews.

1mn3wpt,How do I get a job?,"I’m wondering if anyone has advice about getting a job… so there are a lot of struggles I have with getting a job but the big one I keep thinking about it is transportation to job and interviews. So I live with my parents and I have a drivers license but no car and I’m not very good at driving nor very comfortable doing so. I could in theory, ask my parents to let me borrow the car but I would really rather not drive because I’m not good at it. I could also ask them to drive me but I’m not comfortable with my mom knowing the location of where I work if I got a job because of something she did and now I don’t trust her completely. Once I was working at this place and my mom knew where it was because she drove me and i kept calling out sick because I have chronic migraines and my mom told me I should tell my boss my detailed health history so they know why kept missing work and I told her I wasn’t comfortable doing that and they don’t need to know the details beyond me saying “I’m sick so I can’t come in today”. So my mom took matters into her own hands and went there and told my boss my whole health history and what was going on. She told me when she came home what she did. I didn’t ask her to do that and I most certainly didn’t want her to talk to my boss on my behalf. I wasn’t ok with what she did and since then I can’t trust her. So like I don’t know how to get a job and how I would get there without my mom knowing because I have this fear of her unnecessarily interfering. There isn’t public transportation where I live. And i can’t trust uber because I saw too many news stories about sexual assault happening in ubers so doing ride share scares me (it’s also expensive). 

Transportation is just one of the many issues I have with getting a job. The other issues are my poor communication skills and social anxiety so I do badly in interviews. And I have a lack of marketable job skills. ",1754887615.0,4,3,autism,autism

I am a Psychology student at Massey University and **I am investigating the high school experiences of Autistic people and how that has shaped their adult lives.**

My overall goal is to see what does work and what doesn't, as well as their long-term impacts, so that we can improve the learning experiences of our neurodiverse tamariki.

This research will be conducted using FocusGroupIT, which will function a bit like a ""closed"" social media; only participants and myself (as the researcher) will have access to it. 

I will post questions twice a week for participants to answer (at their own leisure and only if they wish to). Some questions will be private, so only myself and the individual can see the answer, whereas some questions will be public, functioning as an open discussion between myself and participants.

The research period will last 3 weeks, from the 25th of August 2025 to the 14th of September 2025.

I am looking for 3 to 5 people who meet the following **Eligibility Criteria**

- Had attended high school in Aotearoa New Zealand
- Are aged between 22-25
- Have been clinically diagnosed with Autism

**Note** More in-depth information regarding the research and what it entails is available upon request :)

If you or someone you know meet the criteria and are interested in participating, or you just have some questions, please feel free to either send me a DM or email me at 21008773@massey.ac.nz ",1754913835.0,1,1,autism,autism

I didn't realize I was autistic until I was 26 (during lockdown!), but it explains my life-long challenges with dating. I know that dating is more difficult for us, but I'm having trouble dealing with that reality & being in my early 30s & having a womb. I worry that I am running out of time to meet a partner & have biological kids. 

I've never been in a serious relationship, though I have dated casually, and had some positive experiences with dating. I know I still have a few years to potentially find someone, but I wonder if other autistic ppl w/ uteruses have dealt with similar anxieties about running out of time & how you dealt with them. 

Tbh, I'm kind of ambivalent re: having children in that I'd like to have them if I was in a good financial situation with a good partner. But, I don't want to have a kid so badly that I'd settle or compromise my financial stability. I'm from a very expensive area in the US & even though I have a good job (that I like!) I don't make enough money to raise a child on a single income. Trying to find a co-parent & a partner is thus a practical (time+energy required for child-rearing) and financial concern.

The thing is, there are some qualities associated with left-handedness, like pattern recognition. Now I'm wondering. Can this correlation be there not because of the dominant hand per se, but because there were more autistic people in left-handed group?

Probably we'll never know.

For me it’s also everything it encompasses.

If you make it to adulthood, you face the usual autistic struggles on the job market.

1mmo54o,My partner is victim blaming me after I got violently assaulted,"A few days ago, I was really stressed and had a breakdown and started crying. Because of this, some guy came up to me and started accosting me, teasing me, and I tried to get rid of him, but he wouldn’t budge. He even started to lay his hands on me while he was harassing me, which led me to push him away in self defense. In retaliation, he ended up overpowering and attacking me, beating me so hard I started profusely bleeding, before he robbed my phone to try and stop me from calling 911. Eventually my partner got the phone back and I was able to contact emergency services.

After emergency services came, for some reason they started to side more with the guy who was harassing me, and after the police left they decided to say that what happened to me was apparently my fault, that my breakdown pushed him over the edge to start attacking me and that if I wasn’t “so spoiled” then I wouldn’t have had that meltdown that apparently “stressed him out” to the point where he had to punch me until my nose was spraying blood on the floor.

I really feel at a loss for words right now because I feel hurt by what my partner said. It really hurts me to think that my partner would victim blame me in a scenario where I literally got violently assaulted because a guy was pissed off by me having a mental breakdown caused by my autism. It hurts me that they really think that person’s behavior was somehow justified, and for them to try and make it out like I’m the problematic one in this situation feels like a total betrayal of my trust.

1mmzbb9,Representing Music Through Stimming?,"Not exactly sure how to describe this, but I'll try: I've read about other people stimming to music, but I have specific (and individual) stims for every song I like. The best explanation I can think of is that I represent how the music sounds in physical space through my stimming...? If that makes sense? I don't have to think about it, yet it seems intentional and feels incredibly satisfying.

I play piano, so I often ""strike"" the notes I hear on an imaginary air keyboard when there's an instrumental solo. Lol. I also twitch my arms and my torso to the beat sometimes, or I wring my wrists when the percussion leads up to the chorus, and I obviously mouth the lyrics, but the fine details really do differ for every song. I've always associated sounds with abstract physical sensations (it's like seeing things in my mind's eye but for touch), and this is the only way I can make the sensations real. It gives me a similar feeling to writing my thoughts down: making the brain mush into something tangible.

The mood of my stimming completely changes depending on the mood of the song; it's like the music is genuinely using my body as an outlet to ""escape"" and convert itself from something auditory to something tactile.

I couldn't find anyone else talking about this, but I highly doubt it's something only I do. All I've seen is people using similar stims no matter what song they're listening to (like rocking back and forth or pacing, which I also do from time to time, but I mainly have to release the sensations the music creates in my head). Is this even related to autism, or could it be synesthesia? Perhaps? I do have other forms of synesthesia I won't even get into right now because I've blabbered too much.

I do that for some seconds until I run out of breath and inhale again. Sometimes it hurts and I don't want to do it but it seems to be almost automatic. That's it. I have literally no name for this, my parents called it ""doing the force"" when I was younger (I myself don't really know what it means lmao).

But the thing is, I've done this all my life without having a single clue of what it is. Now I'm 22 and some months ago I was diagnosed with autism, so I guess it could be stimming but I'm not sure. It doesn't happen with sensory overload (I generally don't have that much sensory issues tbh, maybe a bit of hyposensitivity, but I never gave it much though). I do it when I'm bored, when I'm daydreaming, when I'm enthusiastic about something, and, sometimes, just in random moments, just because (?).

I am high-masking and have always worked so fucking hard to be understood by other people, to fit in and not be described as a weirdo. I copied their NT behaviour, communication strategies etc. even if it made me feel exhausted and I was clearly not built for it. Now that I am diagnosed, I came to the conclusion that I also want others (NTs who know about my diagnosis, not randos who don't know me anyways) to put in that effort as well – to understand ME better instead of just me trying to understand everybody else. 

I have told a few people about my diagnosis and so far only one of them asked genuine questions about my experience and asked about what accommodations they should make for me. I don't expect people to react the way they did because they were super generous about it haha – its not like I expect people to suddenly go above and beyond and come up with suggestions on their own. I already give them a kick-start, for example giving ""directions"" or examples of accommodations I need – I am just confused because it seems to be expected that I STILL have to work the hardest in order to be understood, and most NTs seem to not even think about the fact that they could actually change \*their\* behaviour to make \*my\* life easier. 

To me it genuinely feels like I put in all the effort and receive nothing in return. Sometimes I feel a bit egoistic about it but I genuinely don't understand why I needed to work on my social skills so incredibly hard all my life to fit in, and allistic people may acknowledge my diagnosis but … that's it? They don't seem to even think about the possibility that \*they\* could try to understand \*me\*, they just say ""ok you're autistic now, that's fine with me"" but won't actually do anything about it?

I have discussed this with my therapist who cannot officially diagnose me, but she thinks I should look into assessments. I'm curious if anyone relates, has any thoughts on my experiences, and I'm also curious if anyone here thinks an assessment could be worth it for me.

* As a child, I was obsessed with dragons and dinosaurs. I collected cards, toys, facts, apps, books, shows, media etc. I knew so much about them and I studied them intensely, and I always wanted to talk about them. I also was obsessed with other animals when I got a little older, like peacocks, parrots, dolphins, bats, and then later cats. I collected so many stuffed animals of these and would research for months or years (typically with books) about these animals. I also loved trains similarly to animals. Now, I have a deep interest in Japanese language and culture, visual arts, and cats, still.
* Even when I was a child, I felt a strong need to talk about something I was interested in or thought was cool, even if I was alone. For example, when I was a child, I would make commercials about certain products and go on and on about how great they were. One specific thing I remember is making a commercial about Vicks VapoRub. I loved it and paced around making a very long commercial talking about how cool it was.
* When I was a bit older, I made a whole company in my mind that I spent hours in my room pacing and making commercials for it. Now, I typically do this in the form of making of detailed storylines, going through my day, or talking about things I just need to talk about. I often pace around and spend a very long time just talking it through with myself.
* I collect a lot of things I don’t need or use and often gain attachment to them. I get very distressed if they are thrown away, lost, etc., and I still think about small items that I lost many years ago.

* I cannot pick up on flirting or flirt myself. I literally do not understand it, or when it is happening, or what it looks like literally ever.
* I have a very hard time understanding what to do with my face, voice, and body in a lot of situations. I feel awkward and unsure of what to do with myself because I am being watched and don’t want to appear uncomfortable or strange. I try to control them to match them to the situation even if it is not that genuine.
* Talking over the phone sometimes made me realize I stim during calls over video calls, which helps me relax. Although I feel I have to watch my tone of voice so that it sounds appropriate to the situation since I can’t show that through expressions. Overall, I hate phone calls though and prefer email or text.
* I never go out of my way to talk to people, it feels too awkward and difficult so I always wait for someone to approach me.
* I was more outgoing as a kid and could talk a lot, and sometimes I was mean and had no filter. But after being criticized heavily for some things I did as a child (that were accidental or things done to become more likeable), I became lonely and very insecure and hyperaware of everything I do. Being outcast by peers made me into a people pleaser, shy, and more self-conscious of everything I do.
* The way I am treated by people has made me feel like I am different from everyone else, like no one understands me, I feel like I will always be an outsider.
* It is very hard for me to make and keep friends. I don’t really go out of my way to make friends, so when I do make them, it happens only like if they approach me. It is hard for me to keep them, because I struggle to contact people especially if they do the same with me. It’s hard for me to really feel comfortable around anyone so I am not usually myself so desire to be with friends is not usually something that I have. Or, they end up betraying or abusing me because I'm a pushover.
* I hate eye contact. I typically break it as much as possible without it being weird unless I feel extremely comfortable and I’m with someone I really trust, which is rare.
* I need a lot of down time and tend to isolate myself. I also distance myself when relationships get too close for comfort.
* I have meltdowns when people overstep my boundaries and have a very hard time communicating them. I try but struggle to communicate them and set them in the first place, but I get extremely distressed when people do things or say things to me that I do not like.
* I am extremely sensitive. Rude words, gestures, etc., can make me have a meltdown even if I’m viewing it over a screen or hearing a story.
* The more stressed I am, the less effectively I communicate. Sometimes when I am extremely stressed, afraid, or self-conscious, I have a hard time even just speaking and saying any words at all. I often cannot talk in these situations, no matter how hard I try.
* Due to communication deficiency, I am often misunderstood. This causes me to always be hyperaware and paranoid about being misunderstood.
* I feel like I don’t fit in, like I’m on the outside, like I have to be a certain way to get along with most people. It is really frustrating, and it makes it hard to talk to those people, even if I really do like them or care for them.
* I think I misunderstand a lot of emotions as anger. Due to trauma, I feel like I recognize emotions more black and white (like either angry, or upset, or sad, or happy).
* I struggle most with facial expressions and body language (and sometimes tone) when I am tired. Other times I’m ok with it and display emotions usually that are disgust, fear, happiness, or frustration. Other times I don’t show emotion and I usually hide what I’m really feeling unless it’s very strong.
* I feel restricted in emotions I feel comfortable showing. I also think a lot about my facial expressions, tone of voice, body language, etc., sometimes it doesn’t go the way I want but I think I taught myself those things because when I was maybe 10-13 I felt I was too monotone and didn’t show enough emotion. I do, however, see now that I've copied and try to replicate my mother's exact way of speaking and reactions.
* I script what to say in conversations, and I used to do it more often when I was younger. I did that when I started developing anxiety in social situations.
* I try to keep track of eye contact, I’m not sure really when to make it and when to look away. It feels awkward if I do it too much and it feels awkward to look away because I don’t know when it’s natural to look away.
* I have some strong issues in communication. I struggle hard to set boundaries, I often cannot describe how I feel, think, or what I need, and overall I just don’t really know what to say most of the time. I think about it really hard so that it is appropriate for the situation, and I want to always say what will make people like me or think highly of me.
* Sometimes I have inappropriate reactions. This is not all the time, like if I see an animal suffering I show distress. But other times, I may smile or laugh at inappropriate times, like if something was not meant to be funny. Or not laughing at something everyone else laughs at.
* I didn’t know why a lot of things I did as a child (that were very rude) were wrong. I had a cussing fit, and I didn’t know why it was bad. I called people ugly, and I didn’t know why it was bad. I hit my friends, and didn’t know why it was bad. I cheated on schoolwork, and I didn’t know why it was bad.
* When I am criticized or judged I get extremely upset and sometimes cry because I feel even more like an outsider and like no one knows how hard I’m trying every day to be “normal” and do things right. I get irrationally angry in these situations.
* I feel more comfortable saying small phrases rather than conversations. I get more nervous and feel more awkward if I talk more (unless I’m in a rambling or venting mood with someone I trust).
* I feel more comfortable on scripts. If I know what to say, and the interaction goes as planned, I don’t feel so nervous. Like at work, I say pretty much the exact same thing to every customer (unless I like them and want to be more friendly, I’ll ask an extra question, or they talk to me).
* I feel distant in my relationships, even sometimes with close ones. With close friends, partners, and sometimes family members, I would not always feel like we were that close. Like there is a barrier between us and sometimes I really do prefer to be alone (although not all the time, I still get lonely).

* I have always played with hair. I used to crunch or tap the ends of hair ever since I was little. I mostly did it with my mom’s hair as a toddler because it wasn’t too soft like mine. As I got older and I couldn’t do it anymore and my hair got thicker, I switched to my own hair. Never once has that habit broken. I tried to stop tapping the ends because it caused damage, so in later years I stroke it and grab a few strands over and over and over. It doesn’t stop unless I have to actively do something else with my hands. I twist and twirl it sometimes, but mostly I just grab individual or a few strands and stroke them, put them in my mouth or between my teeth, or bite off the ends.
* I have had an on and off habit of biting my nails, and chewing on skin from my hands or lips, or inner cheeks.
* I pick at my skin, especially if it’s scabbed or bumpy. I hate the feeling when it’s not smooth and I want it off of me. Sometimes, when I was really young, I would pull off scabs and chew on them.
* I found I rub or scratch my chest or neck when I’m stressed. I also flap or wave my hands sometimes, although I notice it most when I’m stressed.
* I get easily overwhelmed by sound, texture, and light. I hate bright lights and flashes distress me. I hate and love certain textures, really avoid the ones I don’t like, and seek out the ones I do like. Loud, high-pitched, or other obnoxious sounds or visuals can stress me out quickly.
* When I was a kid, I got really upset by sounds like balloons popping, automatic hand dryers in bathrooms, dogs barking, crowds, yelling, etc. and still those do bother me.
* I hate the sound of loud talking and/or yelling, and I hate when I have to speak loudly as well. It makes my ears ring, and it stresses me out.
* I get very hot or very cold easily, which has sometimes caused intense distress.
* Some smells make my nose burn and I try stay away from them. If smells overwhelm me, I can feel dizzy, nauseous, or lightheaded. I notice I dislike a lot of the smells at my job, and it can be distracting, or I force myself not to breathe so I don't feel sick.
* I enjoy other smells a lot, sometimes ones that are maybe abnormal. Such as a cat’s fur, markers, paint, chlorine, sometimes gasoline, etc.
* I hate some foods like mushrooms, celery, and onions primarily because of their texture. Sometimes, the taste of foods I don’t like doesn’t bother me; I just can’t get over the texture.
* I don’t really like to eat meat because of the textures, and I can get physically sick thinking about meat. I always feel a little nervous of eating it because I don’t know if I will bite into fat, a tough piece of it, etc. and those things make me feel very sick. There have been many times where I bite into fat or something and almost vomit. And then I make people angry by getting disgusted by meat because they think I'm insulting them or the cook if I don't eat it.
* Sometimes when I eat, I feel like throwing up. I notice it most with textures I don’t like. I also have a very sensitive stomach, and it is upset easily.
* I get very overstimulated more easily in some environments, such as the store where the lights are too bright, there’s too much to look at, the smells can give me a headache, there are too many people, it’s too loud and there are too many buzzes or screeches, etc.

* When it seems unacceptable to fidget (play with my hair, bite my nails, scratch myself, etc.) I get more stressed and don’t know what to do with my hands. A lot of times to force myself to not fidget, I will tuck my hands between or under my legs.
* I copy what other people do in social situations to appear as normal as possible. A lot of times I feel like it doesn’t work and I feel like I always have to put on an act that’s completely unlike me if I want people to think I’m normal. This is exhausting for me to do.
* I copy words, phrases, and speech mannerisms from people I admire. I repeat them sometimes and talk like people I like so that I appear more like them.
* I lack a sense of identity because I am never really myself. I don’t really know who I am and tend to fluctuate my personality, appearance, and mannerisms based on who I am with.

* It is overwhelming to have to remember certain things, particularly many or detailed verbal instructions. This can stress me out and I often forget many things especially when I feel more pressure to remember.
* I find it very hard to multitask and switch to other tasks. I really dislike being interrupted in one task and being made to switch to something else, it really frustrates me.
* It is hard for me to switch from rest mode to work mode. I always feel frustrated and I procrastinate a lot if it’s something I don’t feel like I should hurry on. I need intense motivation and a good mood to be able to do things sooner and actually do the work. (The only time I will do it otherwise is like if I’m anxious, and I know I have to—which is mostly done to avoid the anxiety.)
* I have a strong preference for routine, despite often procrastinating. I get very frustrated if my routine/order is broken, and I get stressed if I have to suddenly do things I didn’t plan for.
* I hate criticism. Especially when it is harsh, not needed, and/or not helpful, I get very irritated with criticism and correction when it's given to me like that.
* I struggle to understand verbal concepts, instructions, ideas, etc. I respond much better when there are graphs, pictures, demonstrations, examples, etc.
* I am able to focus in the right setting, but I can get easily distracted by noises, sights, thoughts, etc. This can happen even when someone is talking to me.
* I have a high preference for the arts over other careers or topics which often bore me to an extreme.
* I feel intense passion for a certain thing, but that can dissolve and be replaced by another intense passion for another thing.
* Comprehension can be a challenge. I need to be in the right setting and have it provided in an effective way for me to be able to grasp it. Accurately remembering a lot of basic information is hard for me as well.
* I prefer to plan my day and have a routine—although I struggle with effective planning. A lot of times time gets away from me, I get too frustrated or tired to be as productive as I want to be, etc. I prefer routine and familiarity if it works and is comfortable. If it makes things harder for me especially mentally, I typically become more lazy and play games I love, watch shows I love, etc.

* I rely on others to guide situations. I cannot handle a lot of situations myself, especially if they are new and/or uncomfortable. I get extremely distressed and want people I trust take control of these situations.
* I have stereotypically “younger” interests, mannerisms, and preferences. For example, I love games, trinkets, bows and ribbons, juice, candy, frilly socks and bags, stuffed animals, etc. and I typically act younger, so these things appear more normal and are less likely to be odd. Even though I am almost 20, I am often mistaken for being 15-17.
* I move slowly and almost physically cannot move faster without motor and mental difficulty.
* I am clumsy and struggle with balance and coordination. I trip a lot, hit myself on things, drop and spill things, knock into and break things, etc. I have to be slow and careful to avoid this. I struggled with things like to learning to swim, riding a bike, and swinging.
* Sometimes my hands and eyes spasm when I am using them in focused work. It is hard to work small with my hands for more than a couple of minutes because of the uncontrollable spasms.
* I do have some resistance to change—this is in the form of taking new routes to locations, having to switch from one task to another, absolutely having to do something especially if it’s new, etc. (Though sometimes, I do need change—such as a vacation, or a new enjoyable place to go or hobby to do.)
* I have a lot of issues when trying to work out—like my body shaking a lot, I can’t keep my balance, etc. (this might just be weakness)
* I hate unfamiliar situations, if I don’t know what’s happening, I’ve never done something before and it’s not something pleasantly new (like trying a new candle or detergent scent), or something unplanned happens I get extremely stressed. 
* Sometimes I have very intense breakdowns in public. I had a surgery at 14 and when I found out that I didn't have a choice, I had an extreme mental breakdown at the office. I could not stop screaming and shaking when my cat died when I was 16. A conflict in public that was too close for comfort (despite no actual physical contact) had me screaming my lungs out, sobbing hysterically, and hyperventilating when I was 16 or 17.
* I am oftentimes picky. Sometimes if new games, textures (like on clothing) shows, people, foods, etc. aren’t likable quickly, I usually give up on it and go back to what I know I love.
* Mostly when I was a child, seams in clothing caused distress, mostly with socks and underwear. It can bother me now, but I have figured out certain shapes, textures, and fits of these clothing items so they don't bother me so bad.",1754885604.0,2,4,autism,autism

1mn6tow,Understanding Social Cues & Navigating Intense Worlds: By Someone Who Kinda Thinks They Get It," Prereqs: \[**this**\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-17rFGkixQ) video by Chris Gad on how the Intense World Theory aligns with their experience as an *Autism Haver*™. Possibly also autism.

 I should state in advance that I have explicit bias: I am late diagnosed AuDHD (labeled ""gifted"", which, ew hierarchy), and have been the benefactor of significant privilege regarding my upbringing (imperfect as it was) and randomized characteristics (stereotypical rural white middle class perceived at surface-level, occasionally outwardly queer) and may be vastly underestimating the difficulty of adapting to the kaleidoscopic lightshow of social performance without ready access to plentiful educational resources and variable social status as a youth.

 The following is my understanding (under the Intense World Theory framework) of how to shine light on the metaphorical shroud of information density that commonly obscures intent.



**The Gist of It**

 The way the vast majority of neurotypical communication is displayed to autistic people is that a person will say one thing, when really they mean some other thing. This is technically true, but lacks significant context.

 What they fail to include is that there is generally a *reason* for a neurotypical refusing to say the first thing outright: Implication. 

 If I just out and say ""you're a fucking disgusting \[REDACTED\]"", I very blatantly hurt your feelings and make myself look like an asshole in tandem. I can choose to get around this by saying other things that *point to / lead others to believe / ""frame"" (<-neutral connotation) \[thing\] as \[adjective\].* ~~Yes this is also how fascist dogwhistles work but I didn't tell you that~~

 I did it a little just then - in striking through my possibly controversial comment and also ceding accountability in the same breath, I signal to the watcher of whatever panopticon I'm in (as well as the rest of the observers) that I both fear and oppose state retribution and hate manufacturing. The meta example of the previous sentence being said outright is left as an exercise to the reader.

 The above examples are explicit, with clear links to motive and performance of implicit communication. Things are not always so simple, however. Text (and the literal words one says) alone can only provide so much context.



**The Problem is Probabilistic** 

 This quickly spirals out of perceived scale when you realize *most people* are in essentia hiding literal intentions as a rule and result of game theory. I believe this is why so many of us struggle with recepting interest signals (The classic ""She said she wanted to cuddle because she was cold! There's no way that could possibly mean anything else!"", for example, ignoring the *direct implication* that something as slightly insignificant as a few degrees fahrenheit too cold is enough to get them to want to press their body against yours). There is technical benefit to be gained in the form of rejection avoidance if they never *really* ask whether or not you're interested, but functionally obtain that information otherwise. This is one of the very few actual uses of stereotyping; to vaguely guess whether or not something will offend a given person's personality based on the experiences levied onto them (most often by others) due to their inherent characteristics. 

 Of course, you can't just accept any physical contact as interest; you would end up guessing wildly out of distribution and would experience much rejection yourself ~~s/ loser~~, which would be unpleasant. As such, you need to slowly increase the level of confidence of your metaphorical inquiries as you receive more and more unlikely (the more ""explicit"" the implication the higher confidence, ranging from the vaguely schizophrenic ""she barely grazed my forearm in a crowded bus omg I'm in love"" ~~saying from experience~~, to somewhere around ""stepbro I'm stuck in the washer come help me"" ~~NOT saying from experience~~, to adequately and without social overstepping, approach someone romantically over time. Incrementing physical touch implicitly specifically *is also super fucking risky and I have interacted with people with extremely differing opinions on this;* my recommendation is to implicitly request their opinion on the intimacy vs casual-ness axis of physical contact (which itself already requires sufficient rapport) and work from there.

 Yes, this opens up a combinatorial amount of individual dialogue options with various scenarios and personas with wildly varying effectiveness. You will never learn every possible implication of the explicit statement of every fact and action in every scenario.

 You don't have to.



**Identifying Implication**

 Remember that cross-referencing exists. You can use this to combine multiple different less certain implications (both at a given moment and across time) into a more certain implication. If Some Guy™ is simultaneously following a pedestrian of interest, shouting suggestive comments, and driving a car, those three things (display of interest, active pursuit, superiority of access to mobility and physical power) imply the threat of something *very dangerous* for the pedestrian involved. Many men are unaware of (or are superficially ignorant about, I can't quite tell) this, and perceive the exact same situation as simply a display of affection or high appraisal, resulting in much unnecessary discomfort among women. Similar power dynamics can be said about your boss calling you into office, western nations' predatory loaning to third world countries on condition of capital extraction, and anyone towards any person who belongs to a marginalized group that they deem to be one of ""the good ones"" of, somehow directly missing (or exclusively implying, the plausible deniability *is* part of it) the appraisal of the rest of the group as comparison.

 This diffuses across and within modalities. Unnecessary punctuation is overtly formal, displayed excitement level across the performance of a sentence verbally indicates their feelings towards aspects of it (me when I say the gross/not gross thing with some stank for emphasis), and facial expressions and body language paint an idea of the cognizance, experience, and emotions behind it. I believe this is why you can spout rhetoric that literally means nothing and it will have actual effect; *The performance of the emotion tied to the rhetoric* is implying something that people are receptive to.



**Metagaming**

 At some point, you will eventually stumble across the idea to imply something by implying something else, as an even more effective obfuscation measure: Surely no-one will understand what I mean when I mention that ghislaine maxwell was found guilty however-many-fucking years ago, has pictures across decades with the current sitting president, and has recently accolated said president's innocence after a meeting behind closed doors with his appointed attorney general in the relitigation of the epstein case - immediately after discussing power dynamics and their implicit leverage on cognizance and action. (hint: DTIAP) 

 Yeah, everyone else is doing this too. Go figure. Each subsequent level of implication (also called degrees of separation in stem circles iirc) effectively divides the chance of them actually meaning to have implied that thing in particular some factor. 

Functionally, any statement about an individual/group/etc carries a rhetorical social weight in proportion to the severity of all the things implied by said statement. Asking someone their weight means you think their weight is of note to begin with; same thing for most aesthetic opinions people are stereotypically insecure about. 



 Of course, this is all on average. Individuals will have different preferences, insecurities, and opinions that result in the wild distribution of emotional severity of topics we all likely experience.

My main idea from my own experience is just that you give off an uncanny valley effect that people usually label as ‘weird’ with little explanation. Some less convincing ideas I would not agree with I’ve heard is women are biologically hardwired to only pick the best mate and not spread autistic genes, or that it’s not autism it’s only that they complain and whine more.

Ever since that day I’ve been hyper conscious of my own behavior, analyzing my speech patterns, and replaying conversations in my head. I am constantly feeling like no one around me likes me so it’s hard to make friends. Every time i’m spoken to, I sense micro-aggressions, or think that they think I’m dumb and that I need to be spoken to like a child. Nothing is going my way ever since graduating last year and I’m stuck on how to keep myself up.

I often have vivid “hallucinations”, where I imagine what I want to look like in the future, what I want to do, and what kind of job I have, yet I can’t make progress towards the gym without going on streaks of eating junk food, or invest in hobbies long enough, or be good at my job to where I feel like they don’t look down on me. I speak to my friends from time to time about it and they help a lot, but I’m just afraid for the future and don’t think I’ll succeed.

It wraps around my waist like a hug so it kinda makes me feel secure. There’s also my new Warmies turtle, which is microwaveable, lavender scented and weighted. I carry Warmies or weighted stuffed animals in general around with me a lot.

1mmufo9,Feeling super guilty right now,"So a few days ago, my dad and I were talking about doing some fun stuff before I go back to college next week. I said that I’d like to go to Six Flags again before I go back to school, and he suggested we go tonight. He was very excited when he suggested it too. We decided we wanted to go at around 3-4 pm. However, he called me on the phone today at 3:55 and told me something that really made me feel guilty. He said that  he was really tired from working at the other house (him and my mom are renting it to a friend). He told me that my sister was going to stay with the dog, but that if I wanted to go, that my mom would go with me. I asked if he was going, since I wanted to go with him too, and since he seemed so excited about going a few days ago. He said that he could go, but that he had been working all day and his legs hurt. I’m so confused on what to do now. We planned to all go together, and it seems like nobody in my family wants to go anymore. My dad has a tendency to bring me down when we plan to do something and he changes it last minute.

But that’s not what I want to discuss. I wonder if maybe I’m actually not disabled enough to not work. Maybe, just maybe, the real problem is the ideal job for me just doesn’t exist.

The reason why I applied for disability in the first place is because I CANNOT handle stress. When I feel like I have to do five people’s jobs on top of all the stuff I have to do and there’s too much sensory stimuli around me (seriously, whose bright idea was it to play bad pop music at full volume in stores?) and I can’t break go somewhere quiet to chill out…hello, autistic meltdown! And this has happened at pretty much EVERY job I’ve ever had, even when I used to work at a fucking public library. So why should I continue this never ending pattern of jobs that slowly kill me? Why is being overworked and underpaid the norm?

When I give gifts, I try to give the recipient something I know they’ll like or will find useful. If I can’t think of anything, I’ll just do a gift card or something so they can get what they want, and I try to write a heartfelt note with it. 

Why do people give gifts that the *giver* likes and not the recipient? I was gifted something I literally have no interest in or use for. And I’m not trying to be rude. I said thank you and expressed my appreciation, but…it’s literally completely useless to me. The giver said they saw it and thought of me cause it reminded them of when they were my age? But it literally has nothing to do with me at all.

Idk if it frustrates me that they think they know me and gave me something they thought I’d like when it’s not even remotely something I’d enjoy? Or if I’m annoyed that it’s just a useless decoration meant to sit on a shelf and take up space when I don’t even like it? And now I have to either display it so they see it when they visit, even though I don’t like it, or I have to go to the trouble of donating or regifting it.

Idk I just don’t get it? Like cool that you wanted to give me a gift, and I want to be appreciative and not take that for granted, but now it’s just a new burden I have to deal with.

We are each other's best friends and have been for years. When we are not together, he ends up texting and calling me about a lot of things, particularly about his new job. From small to major things. I love talking to him so much. But the volume of these communications... It really weighs on me, as sometimes it feels like every thing stresses him A LOT... I get sent most of his work email drafts and he waits for my approval if they are good or not. and it's not enough to just say ""awesome!"", no, I must give insights (e.g., the email is clear, straightforward and I liked how you said xyz). 

He just called me during his lunch break to chat, which I was so looking forward to! But then the call became the usual waterfall of overthinking, asking for affirmations, wanting me to explain why others in his job act the way they do and so on. A few minutes in, I realized I genuinely just dissociated. I wasn't able to focus on what he was saying, everything on MY end started feeling like a burden and I just became a robot with a flat tone in my responses. Once we hung up, it (as always) affected my work deeply. I was having a good productive day (a rarity for my and my ADHD) but it got turned into executive dysfunction and just staring into the ceiling. 

I feel like I am a sponge, and when he is stressed and overwhelmed (which happens a LOT), I end up feeling like my soul left my body.

We’ve been friends for 3 years and I’ve known about their diagnosis our entire friendship. However, since graduation we now live in different places and our friendship is entirely online now. 

It’s been a bit harder managing our friendship with the distance, because I’m noticing some traits that were easy to work through in person are now amplified x10. Every message I send is questioned and this leads to me constantly explaining myself for the smallest things. I’m happy to accommodate with things like tone indicators, and I do explain myself a lot, but it gets to a point where I start to get a little worn. Like I’m always walking on eggshells not to upset them. 

They also get upset when I don’t respond quickly or if I go to sleep without saying good night - things like that. Because of this I always try to do the little things that I know are important to them, but it can be overwhelming feeling like their entire mood is dependent on me. especially since they feel things, especially negative emotions, very deeply. There are other things that have been affecting me, but the main points of issue are their high sensitivity and clinginess. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this without overwhelming myself? I’ve been keeping up for now, but I don’t want to get to the point where I resent this person because I really value their friendship. ",1754885885.0,1,3,autism,autism

Right. The scene: i'm on the couch in the living room, sis-in-law is in their bedroom yelling at a zoom meeting for some book club (or something, i dunno), the boarder/my bff is yelling into the telephone in her bedroom, and i am lightly vibrating, on the edge of smashing all of our possessions.

I put on my newly-acquired noise-cancelling headphones and launch my chill playlist (""song:""Moments in Love,"" The Art of Noise). Not five minutes pass and here's my sis-in-law waving her hand in front of my face and making the ""take off your headphones"" gesture. Visibly shaking now, i remove them and she proceeds to provide me with a chattering litany of information i did not require. What in the name of all that is heckin' unholy?! *You're* the one who suggested i get noise-cancelling headphones, you should know what they're for!

I am aware that my diagnosis is recent. I am also aware that they have lives. But you might expect *someone* in my circle of 6 loved ones (4 of them blood relatives) to have read a magazine article about autism or watched a 7min YouTube video or some heckin' thing. Literally not one of 6 has done anything to learn about how this earth-shattering revelation affects me, has always affected me, and mostly, what can be done to help me out of the hole i've been driven into and live like a person. And this is with me providing exactly the info they should be learning, all they have to do is click.

Please tell me i'm not alone in getting a diagnosis only to discover how little your family cares about you and you just didn't notice because you didn't know different.

1mmv1k8,Is my diagnosis valid?,"I’m a 21yo female, diagnosed about a year ago now but i’ve kinda known my whole life that i could have autism since i’ve always felt very different from my peers and since almost everyone in my family has autism.

The way i got my diagnosis though has given me mixed feelings because it almost doesn’t feel like it’s valid. 

To make a long story as short as possible: when i was 10 my parents took me to a hospital to get lots of tests done: IQ tests, Math tests, Memory tests, Motor skills tests, etc etc.. nothing notable came out of those.

At 13 i did the same tests again at a different place and the only thing that came out of those was that i had dyscalculia and a “lower average IQ”. Every test i mentioned here had like 30 pages of them talking about every little detail about my life: the way i was born, how long i got breastfed, how i did in school, when I learned to swim and ride a bike, the way i played with toys, the results of the tests etc etc..

When i was 20 i had already had lots of problems with school/burnouts/depression etc, and so i wanted to know what was “wrong” with me so the first step i took to getting a diagnosis (for anything) was to get a consult with the child psychiatrist that did some of those tests when i was younger and ask if they had already given me a diagnosis at the time and if i just didn’t know about it. 

He read all of the documents from those tests again and asked some questions about how i was doing now (later on in life). After he did that he immediately said “it is obvious that you have autism and I don’t understand why noone ever said that” 

After that he even gave me a written “certificate” that said he determined i have autism. 

But i just feel like my diagnosis is not as valid as others because i never (i think) got specific autism assessments/tests.

I’ve always been strange, not fitting in with people and being quite awkward to talk to. As a child, I’d spent my entire break time walking around the playground/field. In loops in the exact same route every time. Teachers didn’t really care to look into it, just thought i was exercising. Even at home, I’d run around the garden, the exact same route etc you get the idea. 

Throughout my entire life since I can remember I do this one thing which apparently isn’t normal. I don’t want to call it stimming because it’s not okay. I bed rot. A LOT. And sometimes I get bursts of energy so, I sit up, and just rock back in forth. Usually listening to music, the more energy I have, the harder I rock. I don’t pay attention, but my arms move weirdly too at the same time. And during these frequent bursts of energy, I’m maybe thinking about things or imagining something. When listening to music, I usually imagine a little music video in my head and it’s really cool imo.

It’s really hard to explain. 

Embarrassingly enough, I do the same thing on the loo. No not listening to music but yes rocking back and forth. The ‘loo room’ is a tiny room and it’s quite nice to stay in. I’ve stayed in there for hours just rocking around, imagining things, brainstorming or whatever idk.. And if i do happen to have an airpod in, you could guess what i do. 

it’s extremely embarrassing, but i’ve done it my whole life! and no one i know can relate! makes me feel like a weirdo but it’s just nice to get rid of that energy yk?

My mom birthed an undeveloped fetus a couple weeks after I was born; I guess it would be considered a miscarriage? I was born healthy - full-term and average weight. They didn't know I was a twin until the miscarriage. I've always longed for a sister, and I believe my (fraternal) twin was a girl.

It's only been about a month since I've started considering that I'm autistic, which was very random. Since then, I've been re-evaluating my entire life (naturally lol) and trying to find out which unusual parts of my life could correlate with autism. I'm looking more into WTSS, and MANY of the lasting effects overlap with autism, specifically non-stereotypical autism (which describes me to a T). Hyper-empathy, sensory issues (including with food), needing quiet ""me time,"" feeling different or weird, being emotionally sensitive, and probably other things. 🤯 Not to mention that when I Google ""womb twin survivor autism,"" several relevant results pop up.

The more I learn about autism and autistic people, the more everything makes sense. This kinda seals the deal for me. I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1fsdqqk/any_twins_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about the same topic, but it's archived already. So just curious how prevalent WTSS is in this sub. If you're also affected by it, my heart goes out to you. 💔 It's a really strange feeling to miss/grieve someone who was never born and have such a connection. And this is a phenomenon that never goes away (at least for me).",1754851566.0,4,3,autism,autism
1mmvx16,Am I too harsh on myself?,"So, the other day, I was chatting to a friend, and we spoke about various topics, and eventually relationships came up

We discussed their relationship, we discussed the relationship of some of our friends (not in a demeaning or out down kind of way)

Anyway, eventually the conversation falls on something I know is coming, but that I’m absolutely dreading, and that’s my love life

Now a small confession, I’ve never been in a relationship, but, my friends think that I have, it’s a very long story, I didn’t make the girl up, I was actually speaking to someone, things never actually got out of the talking stage, but in my excitement, I’d proudly told all of my friends about this amazing girl 

Assuming that at some point, something would happen one way or the other

This however dragged on far longer than I’d expected, and eventually, it had been months and we still weren’t together, but we were still talking

I didn’t want to tell my friends that things had ended, because I was still hopeful that something would happen with her, and I’d already shown them a couple of pictures of her, and it’d have been a mess to explain

Anyway it ended up with me telling them that we dated for about 15 months, before we broke up, which was when I stopped talking to this girl

So they now think I’ve had a relationship with someone, when I haven’t, anyway, that was all really long winded and not massively relevant to what I’m talking about now, but it did feel like some necessary context

But yeah, I’m talking to my friend, and they ask when I’d be interested in looking to start dating etc, I tell them I’m not ready yet (which is true)

They then ask what I’m waiting for, and I tell them that I’m not in the right headspace, I’m not happy with how I look, where I am just in a general life place

And they seem genuinely surprised, acting like it’s completely unbelievable that I’d be unhappy with how I look, or that I have issues in relation to my confidence, and insecurities

And whilst I know he can’t look at me through a lens of potential attractiveness, because he’s straight, the fact he seemed so genuinely surprised, is a complete shock to me

I know he won’t know everything that’s going on in my mind, he doesn’t know everything about me, how neurodivergence affects me, etc etc

The fact that based on what what he does know about me, and the way I present myself to the world, I don’t seem that bad, just goes against basically everything I’ve ever thought about myself, and believed how others saw me

Am I just being too harsh on myself and my own looks? Was he just saying it to make me feel better? Does he need to get his eyes tested? Did he recently some form of traumatic brain injury?

I’m genuinely so confused, it feels like I’m not even speaking coherently anymore",1754864390.0,2,3,autism,autism

1mmvoxc,Autism and IT work (rant),"How do you do it? I see IT as a recommend for autistic people frequently, that the field is made for us.

Ive been in it for 13 years and... Im miserable. The work itself is mostly fine. I like digging in and coding the shit out of some problem, building hyper-specific solutions, and fixing broken systems. 

Problem is I despise corporate life. Even WFH I hated it because I was constantly side-chatted and randomly called by people, pulled numerous directions, etc. Though it did abate the sensory challenges of the office, but WFH is over and Im back in-office so its a moot point.

Ultimately I hate working I guess. Im exhausted being on-call 24/7 at 4 diff jobs over the course of 13 years. I hate working random OT on a whim ""hey man the VP says we need XYZ running by Monday, not Wednesday"" oh good guess Im working half the weekend! Im exhausted with the stupid corporate social games. Tired of people gossiping about me because Im not a ""culture fit"". Im tired of being pulled three different directions -or- given multiple tasks and projects with no direction on any of them. Im tired of being given tasks for which I have zero training and told to ""figure it out"" on top of my other work (no joke. CEO wanted a fleet of macbooks and I was expected to setup our MDM for them and provide support despite zero MacOS experience). Im so fkn tired of systems changing every other month. Why does Microsoft feel the need to change their UI's on all their platforms constantly?? Its so fkn annoying and wastes my time. Im tired of arbitrary executive decisions just cutting off some project Im working on halfway through AND im tired of having random projects dumped in my lap last-second cuz everyone forgot to include me in last months' meeting. Im tired of being stuck in-office 8a-5p regardless of whether workload necessitates it THEN being expected to work OT otherwise when workload increases. Ffs let me leave at 3p daily if the IT budget is frozen for a month.

This has been an endless experience in the field for me. Again, 4 diff jobs (both public and private sector) and 13 years. This is not an issue with just a single company, esp because I see the same complaints regularly across the field.

Any satisfaction I might have using my ""autism superpower of LOGIC and MATHS"" or what-fucking-ever is obliterated by workplace nonsense.

Idk wtf to do anymore, but I keep losing my mind over and over, year after year. Therapy hasnt helped, they just try to teach me to cope. Well, guess what, not only is my job mentally taxing, but corporate life is mentally taxing, and now Im being told I need to add additional mental labor in the form of endless self-regulation.

1mn0hrl,Dating someone with Autism-issues with communication,"I’m not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this in so sorry if it isn’t. I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for about 6 months now. We get along really well, have lots in common, and I love spending time with him. 

Over the past couple of months we’ve been having a lot of issues that stem from his inability to understand social norms, inability to communicate, and need to try to please everyone. For example, I went to meet his family for the first time. They were visiting from out of town and he told me we were going to eat dinner with them specifically so we can meet. I show up to the restaurant and his roommate is there too. I had no clue about this and even though i do like his roommate I felt her being there took away from what should have been a special night where I got to know his family. I was the only person that didn’t know everyone and it was really upsetting and stressful. 

Another example is tonight he asked me to come over and grocery shop and cook food to meal prep for the week to meal prep and eat some. I took this as an invitation to eat dinner but when we got back from the store he tells me in an hour he’s going to eat dinner with friends. This obviously hurts my feelings because I had planned on eating dinner with him and spending the evening hanging out. It feels like a lot of the time we make plans and then he tries to sandwich in plans with other people around our plans last minute and I end up feeling unimportant. It’s especially upsetting because I live half an hour away and typically drive to him because he’s in the city and there’s more to do. So I either end up sitting and waiting for him to come back or driving way more than I planned. 

I don’t care if he makes plans with people, I just wish he’d be more communicative about it and learn to say no to last minute invites if I am already at his house. I have been very direct every time my feelings have been hurt and he doesn’t take it well because he often doesn’t see that he’s done anything wrong. We have to have a long discussion about it and it usually ends with him feeling really upset and me exhausted from saying the same thing over and over again. He spends a lot of time trying to explain to me his point of view as if that will make everything better but I’ve told him that I understand his point of view is different but it doesn’t change the fact that my feelings are hurt. 

For the most part I’ve done a good job at calmly communicating my feelings. I’ve admittedly not been perfect; I have ADHD and sometimes have trouble regulating myself and get emotional but it hasn’t ever been anything degrading towards him- mainly just focused on how my feelings are hurt and why what happened made me feel bad. I feel like we are having the same conversations about being considerate of my time and feelings over and over again and it’s becoming really frustrating. 

I’m starting to feel reluctant to express my feelings because of how upset he gets. I just don’t know how to solve this. I’ve asked him if there is a way I can communicate my feelings that would feel less upsetting or overwhelming and he hasn’t been able to give me a good answer. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice on how I could handle this??? Or how I can help him better understand my point of view so he will consider my feelings and time moving forward??

1mmp3yn,Does anybody else hate sleeping in?,"It’s a random topic, but all my life, I have had a hard time with sleeping in, especially on the weekends. When I was a kid and I slept in, my parents would always say, “Hi, good morning,” in a baby voice. I don’t know why but it always made me so mad. When it happened, I would often have a meltdown and hit myself or my parents. Other times, I would just isolate myself completely and lay in my bed until my mom came and got me. When I did emerge on my own though, I got really, really nervous. I would tiptoe downstairs and try to avoid everyone. Over the years, it got progressively worse, as my family would use more complex sentences like “You slept late today,” or “How did you sleep last night?” I know these are just basic things to say but I get so nervous whenever I hear them. I remember one time when I was a child, I had unintentionally slept in, and my mom said my name and opened my door. I could often predict what she was going to say, so before she could tell me, I said to her, “I know, it’s time to get up.” She replied, “Yes.” Then she entered my room and sat on my bed. I don’t know why, but it made me so mad that I immediately ran away. I’ve done better with this issue through the years, but I still have a hard time when anyone talks to me in a baby voice or acknowledges that I’ve slept in.

1mmoulo,Going to a concert... alone?,"Hi! Help!

I'm going to a concert alone tonight. I've never gone to a concert alone, I'm a little (a lot) nervous. I've been to the venue before so I know my way around. I'm not nervous about sound, I like loud sounds. And it's lawn seating, so I think I'll take a beach towel or a small blanket and find a place to sit.

My concerns are... how do I dress?! The bands are all very indie-ish, but it's still going to be 80 degrees. Would I look silly wearing my favorite suit (a regular suit + pants)? I can't wear my usual khakis though, that would be strange. Maybe just a t-shirt and my jeans, but my jeans are absolutely massive (which I like, but I also don't want to look too goofy). I also don't know if I should wear my red converse which people compliment a lot, but I also wear them all the time, or my red docs, which I rarely wear and they're also red, or my black docs which I wear a bit more so I know they're comfortable, but they're not red (I really like red). Also, I hurt my ankle pretty badly so I want to bring my crutch, but I always feel like people stare at me when I take it places. What time am I supposed to get there? The start time is 6:20 but gates open at 5, so do I get there at 5? Or 6? I want to buy a t-shirt but I don't want to be sitting around for ages.

I've been to this venue three times before, the first time I was a little kid and I threw up, the second time was with my friend at a concert and a tornado hit, and the last time was at my graduation and a tornado almost hit.

1mnago0,ABA is not evil,"


Not every trait that stems from autism is a harmless quirky precious expression of neurodivergence. Sometimes it’s just something that makes life harder for the individual and for everyone around them.

Not every intervention is about “making someone appear neurotypical.” Sometimes it’s about helping them adapt to the world they live in, and while we’ve all heard the saying that “it’s not the disability, it’s the world that makes it disabling,” we just dont live in the  idealized, autism-friendly utopia people imagine. Even if we hypothetically did, autistic people are all triggered by different things, so what works for one might overwhelm another, and some symptoms like self-injury or extreme rigidity are harmful regardless of what society they live in.

Screaming when routines change, refusing to communicate, hitting yourself, or being unable to function without rigid control are barriers to living in the real world. 

Making eye contact, following directions, regulating emotions, and speaking are real-world expectations. We can talk about how unfair the world is, sure, but someone still has to live in it. Expecting society to completely rebuild itself around a neurological minority with severe sensory and behavioral differences and challenges is a utopian fantasy. In the meantime, giving someone the skills to survive in this society is a gift; Not because neurotypicals are superior, but because society doesn’t stop and accommodate every individual difference. We don’t shame physical therapy for trying to help people walk, so why is behavior therapy evil for helping someone learn to speak or stop throwing things? 

Hand-flapping, scripting, or rocking may be harmless in some settings, but there’s still always a time and place. If you’re in a classroom or job interview, and you don’t get the reaction you expected, melting down because you didn’t get to stim is a skills gap. ABA can help someone tolerate that discomfort and still function, instead of crashing emotionally every time they’re dysregulated.

ABA exists to help people function in daily life, to teach basic life skills, reduce harmful or isolating behaviors, and give autistic individuals more tools to navigate the real world. Helping someone become more independent, less reactive, or more able to participate in their own life and the society they live in isn’t the same as “forcing them to be neurotypical.” ABA, at its core, is about helping people function in society. This includes things like speaking, toileting, reducing dangerous stims, learning basic life skills, and yes, sometimes appearing more socially appropriate, because that is a useful skill.

Another common criticism is that ABA ignores autonomy and consent, but unchecked autonomy for someone with severe impairments often means living in a bubble, doing nothing but eating saltines and watching the same cartoon all day. True autonomy comes when you have the tools to regulate yourself, communicate your needs, and make meaningful choices. Real autonomy comes after you build the skills to self-regulate and interact with the world and ABA can build the foundation for real autonomy by helping someone gain the ability to communicate, self-regulate, and engage with the world. Most young children or severely impaired individuals aren’t operating with full, informed autonomy anyway.

Another thing people like to forget is that ABA is a behavioral method, not a substitute for emotional therapy or relational work, and not a complete therapy. It can and should be combined with emotional support, counseling, and family involvement.

Dismissing it for not being everything at once is like complaining that math class doesn’t teach empathy or your dentist won’t look at the mole on your back.

There have been bad practitioners who used it in rigid or dehumanizing ways, but that’s true in every field. Hell, there are still bad therapists, bad teachers, bad doctors, and bad parents out there today.",1754911901.0,0,45,autism,autism

They're incredibly loud and verbose, especially when together (and drinking). I've been dealing with them for decades, so I know how to handle them. My daughter, on the other hand, doesn't. She doesn't spend a lot of time with the two of them at the same time and I suspect she is autistic.

My sister came by to introduce us to her new boyfriend. My mother was already super excited to meet him because he's from the same area of Pennsylvania as we are. (We live in Florida.) So they came over and we all went out to eat at a local pizza place. My daughter and I ate quietly while my father, mother, and sister all drank and talked. The energy level kept climbing and climbing.

Eventually, my daughter excused herself to check out the gaming area. (In actuality, she just had to get away from everyone.) After we finished eating, we sat at the table and they talked and talked and talked, getting louder and louder and louder. It was rough, but again, I know how to handle it. I kept checking on my daughter and eventually, she came back to the table. Shortly thereafter, she became completely nonverbal and I started to get overwhelmed. We kept looking at each other wondering when the hell this would end. Eventually, we came back to the house. My daughter ran upstairs and locked herself in her room. I excused myself to catch my breath and after a while, went back out and hung out with the family until my social battery was exhausted.

This is not an uncommon thing when the family all gets together. They're high intensity Philadelphians and my daughter and I rarely have the energy to keep up with them. Holidays are the worst because everyone is drinking and excited to see each other. My daughter and I can only take so much of their insanity before we're just done with it all.

I’m actually really nervous about meeting with NAME. I honestly wish I was able to have a DSP that I actually knew in my personal life. 

As I’ve told you in the past, I struggle with self esteem/severe anxiety issues, (partially stemming from having a disability and being in special Ed) and I’m concerned that this service will be like babysitting for me. I know you and DDS have tried to explain to me that it’s not, but I can’t get it out of my head. I don’t know if you/DDSexplained it wrong or what.  And of course, I don’t need a babysitter, I’m 27! If I am being honest, sometimes I really hate having a disability. 

For the record, I do think YOU treat me like an adult, but I am worried others might not, despite the fact that I am “high functioning”. I guess I was just hoping you could talk with NAME and let THEM know that I am nervous about meeting with THEM I do think this service could be a good thing and might help me gain independence in some form. 

Perhaps it would help if during the meeting you can explain to me a bit of what a DSP does? I did look at the job description you sent me months ago but it was a little unclear.

There’s something I’ve been meaning to share before we make plans, and I’ve honestly been avoiding it because I was afraid it might upset you. While I truly enjoy spending time with you, this summer I’ve been dealing with intense social anxiety whenever I leave home. It’s been hard for me to get out as much as I’d like, but having [fiancee] with me makes a big difference. She helps keep me grounded, regulated, and calm in a way that lets me actually enjoy being out.

I know you value one-on-one time with me, and I completely understand why. That’s part of why I’ve been nervous to say anything, because I worry you might feel disappointed when I bring [fiancee] along. I want you to know it’s not about avoiding that special time with you; it’s just a current need I have so I can be present and comfortable. This isn’t necessarily permanent, it’s simply where I’m at right now, and I wanted to be upfront about it so we can still spend time together in a way that works for both of us.

I also had a therapist and she came to a conclusion on her own that I might be on the spectrum. She reported her finding back to my psychiatrist (they worked together like a team). Finally, my psychiatrist told my mom that if asperger was still a thing, he would diagnosed me with that but since it's not a diagnosis anymore, he said I have asd level 1. He is also communicating with the school about my condition so that I can have accomodation.

This has been a lot for me to process. My knowledge about autism before the diagnosis was near non-existent. I have two cousins who are nonverbal autistics but they have always been a shush-shush kinda topic in our family and society as a whole. I have read about very long and grueling process people have to go through to get diagnosed with autism (puzzles, tests, interviews,...) and it made me doubt my own diagnosis because it was not the same.
I'm sorry for the long post. Does anyone has something similar happening to them (going from thinking they are the most neurotypical person out there to finding out your whole operating system is different?)",1754827333.0,9,21,autism,autism
1mmxwpo,Hyper empathy syndrome,"I have been a job coach for about a year now and I work with adults with disabilities at their jobs. I recently learned about hyper empathetic syndrome and wanted to share as it has helped me better myself for my clients. I had thought that with autism that sometimes understanding emotions and expressing them were hard for some individuals, but I recently learned with one of my clients that they have hyper empathetic syndrome where they can get overwhelmed with how much they feel emotions. I had surgery and while working with my client I was on crutches and slipped and started crying from the pain when my client also started crying and told their manager he needed to salt the ice outside more while crying. When I thanked my client and asked why they were crying they said that when I started crying they felt bad with how much it probably hurt and didn't want anyone to hurt to the point they cried and that they couldn't help that they really felt I had been pained and felt pained themselves. Now I have done more research and there are many more layers to hyper empathetic syndrome but it really helped me learn with my client that a lot of their struggles were from emotional burn out and I could help find things to help manage it. But as someone that didn't know before I wanted to share my cool learning and hopes that more people will learn with me or even share more about their experiences and things that break the stereotype for autism as every brain is different.

1mmmijw,Religion and spiritual overstimulation?,"If I’m going to be honest, I don’t like going to church or any type of faith service for a multitude of reasons. One is where I don’t know where for certain what I believe religiously but I do lean towards Christianity because I grew up in it, but even going to a church that allows more spiritual flexibility (like not fundie or anything like that) I find is still hard for me. Even churches that are more closely linked to what I believe in. But now I’m realizing it’s not just religious questioning about what I believe in that’s hard for me (that’s its own struggle) but I think church is so overstimulating in general. But stuff that’s isn’t religious but has a similar crowd/noise level to church is less overwhelming to me. Why is that? Can you feel overstimulated spiritually (asking other spiritual or religious people here)? Is it because of how complex it is? Even though I love other complicated topics? Why is it church/spiritual stuff that gets me even if I do believe in it? I do find it less overwhelming in a smaller setting but it is still more overwhelming by far than anything not spiritual/religion related. Also disclaimer I don’t go to a church that preaches hell or anything like that, so it’s not religious guilt. ",1754842256.0,4,6,autism,autism
1mmrttr,Need perspective – why my joke taken so badly?,"I have a female coworker I’m close to, but our relationship is not romantic.

Some time ago, we had a situation where I felt the dynamic between us became tense. To avoid more friction, I suggested we take a 3-week break from private contact (outside of work) so we could both have some space.

Both of us was on 2 week vacation. She started one week earlier.

A few days later, I started to feel that this decision was odd and a bit too extreme. We eventually had some contact again – she messaged me on her own, telling me to send her photos from my seaside vacation and to update her on what I was doing.

When I was at the seaside, I remembered her earlier comment about wanting pictures of sunsets, waves, etc. I came up with the idea to make a LEGO mini-figure at Lego Store that roughly resembled her, and photograph it against these seaside views. I thought it would be a funny, creative surprise. I sent her one such photo.

Her reaction was very negative – she said it “scared” her, deleted all my messages from that point without reading them, and told me “this is all sick” and that I “couldn’t handle” our break. Then she ended the conversation and asked me not to contact her during my vacation.

My intentions were lighthearted and positive.

I care about this friendship, but right now I want to give her space. I’m just wondering if this was “too much” due to differences in perception, or if I genuinely overstepped.",1754854525.0,2,6,autism,autism

1mmnjwb,Newly diagnosed in my thirties,"I’m new to this community/sub, and I’m sure this gets posted multiple times daily so I’m sorry if this is just adding to that. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 18 after a 5-10 minute conversation with a doctor in a hospital. At the time I remember feeling relief. I had always had felt there was something different or “wrong” about me, but not being able to describe my emotions or feelings made it difficult to express how I actually felt. So I accepted that diagnosis happily as I felt, “oh I finally know what’s going on with me.” 

For the next 20 years the same problems continued for me as I was endlessly cycled on and off of different drugs. For years maybe even a decade I’ve known that my diagnosis was wrong, but there was nothing I could do to be evaluated by any one. I’ve always been on Medicaid so great healthcare has not always been available to me especially for psychiatric care or therapy, but this year I was finally able to see a specialist who deals specifically with neurological and psychological testing. 

After days of being interviewed, given puzzles and questionnaires, and had family members and a friend interviewed I was diagnosed with autism and obsessive compulsive disorder. The obsessive compulsive part I understood, but I wasn’t sure about autism at first. I have a cousin who is non verbal so I think that’s kind of the only awareness of what autism was that my family and I had. The doctor went over the diagnosis with me and what autism is, and I couldn’t believe it. Everything she was describing was exactly how I’ve felt my whole life, and I had no idea. I immediately went through my whole life thinking about how I act, things I’ve done and how I function. I can’t believe I went 20 years taking medication I didn’t need for a disorder I clearly didn’t have. The doctor I went to was shocked I was ever diagnosed as being bipolar. Anyways, it feels great to finally after all this time have an answer.

1mmqr8y,how do I help my autistic sister?,"hello, I am posting on this subreddit looking for advice on how to help my (16f) sister in her day to day life and going into adulthood.

basically, over the past few years Ive been responsible for my sister and what not. I do the basics such as feeding, bathing her, etc, but I always get told I have to teach her more things by my grandma. though, dealing with her is already a hassle for many reasons and its hard to teach her skills to incorporate in her daily life. so Ill give a few examples of things I struggle with while dealing with her so my point makes sense.

taking her outside is sometimes a struggle. recently we went to go eat and after helping her eat I told her to go throw the trash away (mind you there are a bunch of people around us) . she literally RUNS right past them just to throw the trash away and this lady was staring at us and it was truly so embarrassing. she always runs everywhere no matter what. even if its raining and she were to fall and hurt herself she wouldnt care and just continue running.
she doesnt acknowledge her bodily sensations. if the food was burning hot she’ll still eat it without a care in the would. if a bugs crawling on her, she wouldnt react. even if something hurts she wouldnt really react unless its a certain sensation (such as getting pinched).
next point is nsfw so beware!!

3. today, she recently started taking off her clothes again. I went outside for a few minutes and when I came back inside she was butt naked. she hadnt done that since around may when we left our grandma’s house but now she’s doing it again. and I only remember this habit starting after we moved houses and moved into our grandmas house. then , when we moved out of our grandma’s house it stopped until today when it came back again. then I was upset she did it so when I tried distancing myself from her she started hollering and crying in the gas station and I had to tell her to stop because it was getting on my nerves and it was embarrassing, especially since it was a small gas station.

and here are some things Ive noticed/know about her.

non verbal
anytime my dads around she gets really happy and excited. he babies her and doesnt take any of my concerns about her seriously (ex: “she doesnt need glasses” when we just went to the eye doctor to fet her glasses)
doesnt realky smile around me? maybe its because Im sometimes mean but whenever I act silly sometimes she’ll laugh
cannot focus AT ALL. whenever I get her to do something such as put the food in the microwave or whatnot she’s always STARING in a different direction. recently, the place we’re at now has a mirror and the just stares at the mirror all day.
always has her mouth in a constant snarl? like, her top lip is always up and her teeth are always showing. idk how she does it since I would assume you would constantly have to use your mouth muscles for that 😭
hums every single day. I know its her stimming but sometimes she starts humming really loudly and its sometimes annoying 😭
however, recently when we went to the eye doctor we tried to assess her vision (when you look at the red house). she kept moving which made the entire process hard, however, she may have a 10+ in her right eye and a 13+ in her left eye and was prescribed 9+ glasses. though, it may be hard for her to wear glasses because she hates wearing anything on her head such as her bonnet.
has a mind of her own. whenever I try to get her to do something sometimes she’ll do the opposite. such as turning off the shower while I go to grab something, taking off her bonnett when I tell her to put it on, taking off her shoes before we go somewhere , etc etc.
shoves food in her mouth. I literally have to watch her eat and she’ll try shoving an entire piece in her mouth. I have to do this to prevent her from choking 💀
I also have to find an institution for her to stay in while I go off to college within a year, however, Ive only heard horror stories about places such as those. and plus, watching the korean movie “silenced” didnt make it any better ☹️ so I need heavy advice on this aspect too because Im not sure if Illinois be able to pay for a nice institution/center for her to stay in.

1mmapni,Does anyone else have trouble reading the signals their body is sending?,"Sometimes I won’t realize the reason that I’m feeling sad is because I’m hungry until I’m shaking and lightheaded. I won’t realize I haven’t drank water all day until I have a headache, or that I’ve needed to pee for a while until my bladder is aching. 

This usually happens when I’m really immersed in something, like my job or my crochet project. But sometimes I will spend all day doing nothing and realize that I haven’t consumed food or water in hours. 

I’m really grateful for my friends (like I know it’s time to eat when they are eating) and for days when I have a set schedule, like I know I need to eat breakfast to function at work, and that at 12 I need to take a lunch break and stuff like that, but after work or on weekend I completely lose track of time and I feel like I don’t know how to hear my body until it is sending SOS signals.

1mmpqg4,Is this autistic burnout?,"I’m posting here because I strongly suspect I’m on the autism spectrum, and what I’m dealing with lately doesn’t feel like just depression or anxiety. It feels like something deeper—maybe autistic burnout. I want to hear from people who’ve been through something similar or understand this condition better than the psychiatrists and therapists I’ve seen over the years.

Here’s where I’m at:

I’m absolutely miserable. This has been most of my life, but it’s gotten significantly worse in the past few years. I’ve been unemployed and isolated for about two years. During that time, my sensory sensitivities have exploded—light and sound feel overwhelming, especially in crowded places like malls, and it drains me physically and mentally to the point of feeling lightheaded, like I’m about to collapse. I used to cope with depression before, but now it feels different.

Even after resting and trying to “get better” for years, I can’t seem to move forward. I come up with ideas and plans to improve my life and finances, but I immediately freak out and abandon them. I’m stuck in a loop of doing nothing, and even things that used to bring me joy feel flat and pointless.

I’ve tried therapy many times, but most psychiatrists and psychologists I’ve seen don’t seem to understand autism in my country—they often dismiss or misunderstand what I’m going through and prescribe SSRIs that do absolutely nothing and sometimes even worsen my condition.

My anxiety has become unbearable, and suicidal ideation has been a loud, persistent voice since late last year. I’m completely isolated—rarely leaving my apartment and going days or weeks without human contact.

I feel disconnected and disillusion from everyone and everything. Attempts to form meaningful relationships fall apart because I’m “too intense” for most people. I’m tired of pretending to fit in and wearing masks. I struggle with being too honest and too literal, and I also think in an existentialist way that often clashes with those around me. I live in a very closed-minded culture, and I’m too individualistic for it. I have no support— even my “family” has long abandoned me and shamed or ridiculed me for being different, lazy, or a slacker.

I’ve dealt with addiction—mainly hash, which was the only thing that quieted the noise in my head and let me enjoy moments. I quit everything in November last year, including SSRIs, but haven’t improved.

The world feels unstable, especially now with AI and rapid change. The usual advice—“get a job,” “try hobbies,” “build skills”—feels insane or meaningless when everything feels so uncertain. I’ve tried pushing myself to do something, but it always seems to backfire. Traditional jobs, in particular, leave me miserable. I can’t lie to myself about it anymore—I can’t go back to the mindless loop of going to a place I hate just to get paid scraps that I then spend during the month. I’ve realized I’m even spending money just around work—transportation, lunch, etc. It feels pointless and offers me nothing in return.

Does this sound like autistic burnout? How do you even start moving forward when your brain and body are shut down, motivation feels impossible, and everything feels so overwhelming?

Any honest insight or shared experience would help. Thanks for reading.",1754849705.0,2,2,autism,autism
