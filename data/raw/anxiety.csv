1iwvbzn,r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators,"Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",1740377437.0,37,23,Anxiety,anxiety

1mq6upr,"My therapist just told me that ""propranolol does not slow down your heart rate and I am here to dissallow you of your placebos""","
My therapist and I are working through my panic disorder / GAD - standard CBT stuff, ive done it before but have had a bit of a lapse and so got myself back into therapy asap.

3 sessions in, and today we started talking about specific situations that trigger an anxiety response in me. I spoke about a time in which I had become physically exhausted and my HR was high - this is a massive anxiety trigger for me, and my coping mechanism was ""take propranolol"". I did so, knowing it has an onset of 30-60 minutes, and I was then able to somatically lower my heart rate by deep breathing and moving my body around - got my HR down in 5 minutes, i didnt even need the meds.

This then led us onto talking about my prescribed propranolol, and he told me ""it just stops tremors. it will not prevent a high heart rate"". Its a Beta-Blocker. Regulating heart beat is one of its primary functions.

I pay £85 an hour for these sessions, and I really get along well with him- but this has shaken my trust a little bit and upset me. im going to bring it up with him in our next session, because he is either misinformed, or lying to me to prove a point. and I cant work with that.",1755191811.0,152,65,Anxiety,anxiety
1mqk6ws,Wish more people knew this,"The solution to anxiety is quite literally being indifferent towards it

I have struggled with anxiety for like a decade and once I stopped caring about all the weird thoughts, physical sensations and stopped writing these pretend stories about things that haven't occurred yet it all just stopped. It took a lot of practice but I really think this is the way out and more people should understand this.

Unfortunately we are constantly told anxiety is something to try and fix cope with but that only fuels the fear cycle with however you anxiety manifests. Anxiety is your body doing exactly what it should be doing.

Idk just my thoughts but I think more people should try welcoming the anxiety and letting yourself feel it. Once you lose the fear it, it just stops.",1755222707.0,23,21,Anxiety,anxiety

1mqmmrq,I’ve been feeling so unwell and I don’t know what to do anymore,"Just for context I am a 19(F) who has not had any prior health issues. For the past month or so straight I have been feeling debilitatingly unwell. 

It all started back in march where I developed this unexplained stomach issue where I was constantly nauseous and could not eat and didn’t have an appetite (no pain though). I also felt very weak and had a hard time walking due to intense fatigue and maybe unstableness. Went to emergency and told I was fine and all my bloodwork/stool tests/urine tests are fine 
I also did ultrasounds for my stomach 

Fast forward maybe a week and I feel way better, but then the issue returns constantly over the next few months. Did an endoscopy and told I was completely fine. Bloodwork has always been good other than iron. 

After talking to doctor after doctor I get told I probably have anxiety. This isn’t shocking to me as I’m a hypochondriac and a germaphobe and overall overthink a lot, but I don’t rly have anything to be stressed about to the point where I PHYSICALLY feel horrible. 

Now I’ve been feeling sick for a month straight and have barely eaten in the past four days. I feel awful and like I’m dying but every time I go and get myself checked they find nothing. 
At this point I’m desperate for any advice or just people who may have a similar experience as me.

1mqm6e0,fear of smelling bad,"hi, I've been feeling like I might smell bad, even though my friends and family insist I don't. I tried wiping my armpits with my hands and smelling them before reapplying deodorant in school—nothing unpleasant. I even smelled my armpits directly—still nothing. Yet, when I use a shirt to wipe my ua, the shirt starts to smell bad after about 3–5 hours. Initially, when I wipe the shirt on my armpit and smell it right away, it doesn’t smell bad—but a few hours later, the shirt emits a noticeable odor. I don’t know how to describe the smell, it’s not like the smell of an onion but I hate it. I've also asked many people if I smell bad— even asked my closest friends to smell my armpits, and they all say I don’t and that I’m hygienic. Does that mean my armpits stinks or it’s just the shirt? pls help me, I’m still overthinking even though my friends and family said my armpits don’t smell bad😭😭",1755228277.0,2,0,Anxiety,anxiety

Doctors dont say shit went to a hundred tests with no answers they all started to say i should travel or its just anxiety. How? 
I have constant tensing muscles all over my body, aching, sometimes so bad it feels like its my bones. My calves are almost always tensing/cramping.

Fatigue, like i have zero energy to do anything everyday.

Also this freaking throbbing or pulsing sensation in the back of my neck/head is so freaking annoying, which is Constant 0/24 everyday, nowadays i hate being awake now. Cuz of this feeling.

Did i mentioned this dread feeling? Feeling sick to my stomach? The DIZZYness which is constant chronic 0/24 and ongoing since 2 years? Also all my symptoms are going since YEARS. Its freaking tiring.

Blurry vision? Anybody? Sometimes i get so blurred vision i cant freaking see anything. What up with that? Yep i went to several optomethrist and eye clinic. Everythings fine.
Othertimes its just slight blur with dizziness. Nice.

Some nice headpressure with the bundle, above my eyes, forehead, or some throbbing? Yep really nice.

Nausea? Low appetite/no appetite. Abdomen cramps aches? Lovely feeling. Doesnt matter what i eat. 

Also have some mini panic attack nowadays i guess or idk what is this feeling. Suddenly feeling this impending doom coming.

When i engage in conversation i go instantly into fight or flight mode, my symptoms are amplified by 100x. Especially dizziness.

Looking at screens and concentrating is a chore.

Whats up with this fear of height? I had like 3 panic attack the other day in the supermarket bcuz of escalators. Also having these images popping into my head randomly about height and get Really bad adrenaline/fear sensations or surges.

When i feel really bad i take one Famotidine, yep, famotidine, it knocks me out so bad i fall asleep. 

Someone can reassure me that, im not going insane and anxiety can be like this? Im beyond frustrated and tired.

1mqjdrk,Health anxiety and stimulants (nicotine especially),"I have got health anxiety for almost a year now. I wont get into how I got it and other problems that I have with it just this one because it bothers me the most. 

I am 20 years old and I have smoked for some years and drank coffee everyday before i got health anxiety. Ever sincer i have health anxiety I have stopped smoking completely and I drink coffee only because I want to get used to it again. At the start I started getting panic attacks because of cigs and just stopped, coffee too but thats more manageable.

Problem is that I do not like the fact that I quit smoking kind of “forced”. I really, really want to be able to enjoy coffee and nicotine again at least half as good as before. Everytime i try to smoke the feeling that i ve got before anxiety is not there only anxious toughts and feelings.

I heard a lot of people say that I would never be able to smoke again like before but I really cant cope with that and I wont accept it. The fact that I convinced my mind that smoking will kill me at that time and I ingrained that tought that deep that know even if I know ciggarettes will not kill me short term i just cant enjoy them. 

Last time I smoked some ciggarettes I forced them in and kinda fought the feelings off for some hours but the anxiety crept in anyway and I entered a 20 minute semi panic attack. 

I understand that smoking is a bad habbit and unhealthy but I really want to be able to enjoy it sometimes in a vacantion lets say. I have changed my lifestyle 180 degrees since anxiety, i ve been much healthier, done sports etc. but now i want a really normal life where I could enjoy some “unhealthy things” too.

What can I do to be able to feel good smoking again? (I didn’t specify but I understand why nicotine makes me anxious, its a mix of anticipatory anxiety and the actual stimulant effect of it but i cant control it so thats why i need help)

1mqmy9m,I can't stop puking during exams :(,"So every exam I have it feels like doomsday. If I remember what I have studied during the exams then I would have no problem getting passing grades. 

But my anxiety feels like it puts a dazed spell on me, making me mentally all over the place and yet still not here. But the grossiest part is that always a hour or two before I can't stop heaving and the closest the exam gets the more close I am to puking. During the exams I am more focused on keeping it in so to not bother others, resulting to me having to ""get it back down"". I have wrecked so many exams because of it. I have tried so many tips online. 

But I really want to go to uni. I am out of high school but need some credentials getting in to uni. But I have wrecked so many exams by my mind just blanking during the exams and having to swallow throw up. My stomach feels like it is a volcano of battery acid and cramps like hell.

My stomach is sensetive to begin with. I have gone through the material many times, have gone through practise exams, question what I didn't fully anderstand. Looked at what went wrong and at the why and how. 

I find the blanking part worse. I push myself from beginning to end of exam, but my results and answers look like I haven't read even a sentence of the material. It is so demotivating seeing others able to write answers so passionately while I feel trapped in space. 

At is at a point I need to do perfect and I mean no point less for my oral exam to be able to just barely get in. My whole summer sucked since I am just only studying, trying to adapt to acomodate and improve my results and just me failing entrance exams. 

I just want to be able to live like people my age. It is my dream to study what I want and this is my plan b. I feel stuck in life due to my body freaking tf out at every exam, no matter how much I try to relax, take breaks etc.

Scared to gain weight from medication and also my joints are sensetive to weight gain (I am not currently borderline overweight, overweight or obese). I have an exam over a few hours and I am so checked out at this point, luckily I can still have a chance with the oral exams, but the way it is going I have no hope. 

Hearing things like, ""the procces for you will just take a bit longer than other people"" just makes me feel so low that I don't want to want to wake up knowing I have failed due to myself. 

Going to the doctor in my country is such a long and frustrating journey abd I keep getting dismissed with every problem I have and I have this with multiple doctors. So I am looking for private care options (but it is out of the country, since I couldn't find it here) or online. But I just want it to stop.

1mqhz83,question about intrusive thought,"Okay so… I’m 24 and I have this thing that I find kinda funny and disturbing at the same time. I’m gay, have always been insecure and was bullied in the past which kickstarted some mental health issues for me. I’ve been dealing with health anxiety since I was a kid, but it was never really a big deal as I’m a very rational person and could easily (with the help of my parents) calm myself down and move on with my day as if nothing happened.

However, as of march 2023, I’ve been having this issue with a very specific intrusive thought that I can’t seem to shake off for some reason. It’s basically the idea that there is some higher power that will ‘strike down’ on me if I stop worrying about my health / let my stress go and just start living. I know it’s complete horseshit, so it’s not like I’m psychotic or schizo, but at the same time this is the one single thing that is stopping me from getting rid of my hypochondria for once and for all and it really bothers me that - to this day - sometimes it still induces panic attacks.

1mqeeoe,I’m having a random anxiety attack right now,"To be fair, my anxiety has been more intense again lately (and generally this year), after an anxiety attack related to having a headache while trying to sleep (triggering some migraine related trauma), which has happened to me many times before, especially this year, but right now I’m having an anxiety attack for seemingly no reason. 

I just started feeling slightly off before bed though without any clear or actual symptoms or anything that usually triggers my anxiety, then I tried to sleep and I kept feeling weird until suddenly I find myself having an anxiety attack. Now I’m sitting here again, all alone and it’s dark outside (which always adds this anxiety for me), no one to reach out to, with these full body tremors and constant yawning and nausea and over-productive bowels. It doesn’t help that I always stress myself out when this affects my sleep (especially when the last one had me stay up almost all night and only catch 3 hours of sleep) and that I’m having some one sided head pain that doesn’t let up when I lie down and seems to be getting worse (I know anxiety and tension and eye strain and lack of sleep are probably causing this right now, but the migraine fearing part of my brain won’t listen to reason). 

My anxiety attacks can’t be calmed down by grounding or breathing exercises. Talking or writing or other distractions help when I’ve already calmed down a bit, but when it’s triggered or accompanied by physical issues it often keeps coming back in waves until I feel physically fine again (which is why I took a painkiller just now but idk if it’ll work cause sometimes it doesn’t and I don’t wanna take more tbh).

I don’t know what I’m asking for really and I’m sorry for this not too thought out, rather desperate post. I’m just really tired of my anxiety once again having such a grasp on my life. I feel like there’s little hope to no hope for a normal life unless I go on meds which personally I’m very reluctant about.

Maybe someone has some advice I haven’t heard before, some trick I haven’t tried or just some comfort to offer.

1mqm8tu,How to get out of an anxiety loop (?),"Hello! For a little context, I am a hoarder both with material and digital objects/files. I've also am currently still fighting low self esteem, after being in an ED. I've noticed a pattern before that every time that I do nothing for a long amount of time (like when at home at summer/winter break) I tend to ruminate and worry about things that shouldn't affect me anymore.

This year's summer isn't different 

While I was at home just minding my business, resting and chilling. I had an anxiety attack cuz my professional email had numbers in them, I thought that I was not gonna get a job once I graduated. It lasted for a few days then it transformed into me getting anxious by the fact that I have 5 gmails and I don't wanna add another one, this lasted for a few more days. Then my reddit account (this one) almost got deleted, and I spiraled since this is my ""emotional support reddit account"". So I had to delete a few video files from my Senior High School days so that I could receive help from reddit (my email was full so I wasn't getting notified). Then when I thought I was healing, I had another attack. This time it was me worrying about my National ID, cuz I still didn't have my national ID and I thought people would either impersonate me or make fun of me. Then while I was, cleaning my room to cope, I saw my graduation photo of me and my mom and it was completely DESTROYED!!!! I had a mental breakdown and I've been in a rut of anxiety and shame and guilt. After a few days of being anxious I thought I was healing THEN I got another attack cuz I remembered my school Microsoft Office account from when I was in junior high. I can still access it and I got scared people would see my documents and either use the information to impersonate me or bully me for my interest, I was able to rationalize it by saying that my school account will expire and that MS Office is not a social media so NO ONE WILL LITERALLY SEE IT!!! then when my account did expire, I remembered the PPT works I created and I wanted them back, But since it's already expired I couldn't access them anymore. Now Im in a bigger rut since I'm scared that I'll forget all my interest and passion and whimsy and love since I lost all my PPT works (if I did have one, from what I can remember I didn't even use PPT until SHS). I also feel guilty for not being able to recover those files while I still had access to them. I literally hadn't had a normal day without anxiety, and I'm really embarrassed trying to tell my story since the reason for my anxiety is SOOOO WEIRD/UNCOMMON/embarrassing. I am feeling myself get into another rut since I remembered an old school shirt that I love and I can't find it, so before I spiral again, I wanna ask how do I stop thinking 😭😭😭😭 I've been in this cycle for approx 1 month, school already started but I'm still anxious.

Tldr how to stop ruminating and overthinking and how to stop creating problems in your head so that I can stop and know what to do if it ever happens again

1mqlz9i,Cycled through every symptom of anxiety this summer,"Just wanted to share my story in case anyone else is struggling. 

Ever since greening out on an edible at the beginning of the summer I seem to have triggered an anxiety/panic disorder. I first had the fast heart rate and trouble breathing. So much so that normal activities like taking the subway felt like something was chasing me. I felt weird tingles and sensations trying to sleep. Then came the head sensations almost like being drunk. Now thankfully I’ve gotten a lot better and my anxiety mostly comes at night when trying to sleep. I think about death and how sleeping is exactly like death. I’ve started working out daily which I think has helped me feel more healthy. I’m grateful most of the daytime symptoms have gone away and I think my nighttime ones will go away soon too since each of my symptoms lasted a week or so (weird they came one by one and not at the same time).

i’m a student and i got my results on last tuesday, i started feeling like this around 3-4 days before they came out. i assumed it was because of my results but it never went away. i constantly have chest pain, my throat feels like it’s about to close up and i feel extremely nauseous. 

it’s affected my sleep quite a bit, i used to sleep a good 8-9 hours daily but i can’t seem to sleep longer than 3-4 hours every night now. if i wake up once, its impossible for me to go back to sleep. 

i can’t even try to throw up to make myself feel better since i have really bad emetophobia. 

i’ve tried applying for a university abroad and it’s been my life goal since i was a little kid. my guess is that i’m anxious to see if i get accepted? and that if i do get accepted, id have to leave everything behind and go to a whole different country all by myself. 

how do i stop feeling like this? i dont have access to go to a professional, and i dont want to take any sort of medication if it isnt prescribed. thank you for your time! ",1755227416.0,1,1,Anxiety,anxiety

1mqkcsi,Crazy anxiety flare up,"Hi all, I actually created a page just to post this and get some feedback back from others and see if anyone has had this happen before. 

So I was diagnosed with MDD, PTSD AND GAD back in 2022, I doing CBT therapy and had a psychiatrist that I regularly talked to and was prescribed Zoloft mainly for the depression. Long story short I was bumped to the highest dose which was 200 MG and stayed there for a while. I felt great, lessened my depression and anxiety and I was actually feeling like a normal person. Fast forward to last year, November I turned 26 and was taken off my parents health care (as per usual) and I ended up having to switch my self to a different health care. I went through covered California and was on Kaiser which is what I was on with my parents which was great, but - with covered CA, if your work offers health care then you won’t be eligible for assistance so, I opted from my works health care which was Blue cross. All was good until April, our company got bought out by a NEW company and they had told us that because we were technically “new” employees to them, we were on a 90 day probation where they would determine who was eligible for health care and benefits. I think you can guess that, this new company ended up saying hell to the no on benefits so we all lost out health care. I ended up having to go BACK to covered CA but, because I hadn’t applied by a certain day, my coverage isn’t in affect until the first of September. So now, this is where all of this jabber about health care comes into play - BECAUSE I did not have health care and or the means to purchase any more of my SSRI, I had to make the choice to ween myself off the medication all together. I came down from 200 too 25 mg from April to the end of June, and let me tell ya, the SIDE EFFECTS WERE JAMMIN - but I eventually got over them and thought I was doing fine. However, this past 2 weeks, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing, heart palpitations and just overall had to catch my breath even when talking. I am also diagnosed with anemia so I thought that, because I was low on iron it could be the reason why I was feeling this way. I snapped one day and called my mom panicked, asking her to take me to the ER because I was afraid something was wrong, and she ended up taking me to urgent care where they kinda just listened to me and nodded their heads in agreement with everything I was saying telling me “here take this inhaler for your asthma and take some iron, wait 3 months and you’ll feel better” which, I did feel better after being seen but, I didn’t feel like that did anything?? So from that point on it has been INTENSE anxiety, 24/7. I mean, so so anxious to the point where I can eat, sleep, focus or do anything that doesn’t involve feeling my heart beat out of its chest. I’m having such intense anxiety all day long it just feels like I’m constantly in a panic attack and there’s no escape. I feel trapped. Heart racing, can’t breathe, can’t sleep, nausea, vomiting. It’s been 2’1/2 weeks of feeling this week and I keep feeling like this will never end. I ended up taking myself to the hospital one day because I just COULDNT calm down, nothing would work and I couldn’t get any sort of relief. They took me in and gave me fluids, kept me there for a little while and gave me 10 MG of hydroxyzine to calm me down. I was calm in the hospital, and thought the meds would help at home. Told the DR all what I’ve said here and she gave me a temporary refill off my Zoloft 100 MG and told me go back up to my original dosage and talk to my primary care once my coverage hits in September. 

Im now 6 days back into taking 50 MG of Zoloft and I just can’t help but think that I will feel like this forever. That the Zoloft will never work and I will be constantly anxious for the rest of my life and I won’t ever be a person who can do normal life things and it’s so debilitating. Has anyone ever had this type of feeling? Like a sudden flare of such intense anxiety that lasts for weeks at a time with no relief? It’s even so bad that I can’t sleep, because if I sleep then I know I’ll feel the exact same ALL OVER AGAIN. I just feel like I’m crazy and I don’t know what else to do anymore. 

Sorry for the longest post known to man but, it feels good to get this off my chest. Please let me know if anyone has felt like this before and what I can do to help calm myself down so I can actually function like an adult? Thanks in advance! ",1755223164.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

1mqjw2w,How can I get over my anxiety?,"Hi guys. I (F19) suffer from PMDD and anxiety. I am currently unmedicated for anxiety (but am on birth control) as I cannot find a medicine that works for me. I take Vistaril 25mg as needed, but it makes me more drowsy than anything. For some backstory, I have been on birth control since last year and have taken it consistently, never missing a dose. However, back in June, I screwed up my pills. I won’t go into detail, however, I didn’t find this out until about a week after intercourse, so there was nothing I could do emergency contraceptive wise. I called my doctor, and my pharmacist, and they both agreed that as long as the pills looked okay, that I should be fine. I continued to take my pills like normal and had my regular withdrawal bleed in June. Even though I had my bleed, I convinced myself that I could still be pregnant (I kept seeing posts that explained how you could still bleed on birth control and still be pregnant without knowing.) I tried to push away this feeling, but in July, I started to have nausea, headaches, and just this gut feeling that I was pregnant. I took two tests well after the “testing time frame” and they were negative. I didn’t trust these tests because I continued to have nausea and headaches. No other symptoms though. I have had myself convinced that I am pregnant. Yesterday, I seen my doctor and she performed a urine test on me, which came back negative. I made sure to not drink any fluids as to not dilute my urine and did everything the right way.

I don’t necessarily get a full-blown panic attack, but I feel unsettled, my heart might beat faster, and sometimes it even keeps me from sleeping.

It’s not about being late for something. It’s about not knowing what time it is, and I can’t explain why. This has been with me since childhood — my parents used to make me go to bed very early, and I remember feeling incredibly distressed by it, even crying at times.

Nowadays, I notice it most when I have no screens or clocks around. If I’m doing something, I forget about it, but if I’m just sitting there, I end up checking the time every minute when I can. During the school year it’s even worse because my mornings are ruled by catching the bus and train, and my evenings are a race to make it to the train right after classes end. That constant awareness of time makes me even more dependent on it.

I’ve never tried to “train” myself to live without knowing the time, but honestly, I’m not sure I could.

Does anyone else feel this way? Is this part of some bigger anxiety pattern, or just a personal quirk? How do you deal with it if you’ve been through it?",1755207689.0,2,3,Anxiety,anxiety

1mqja6g,"Chest pain, Racing HR, nausea, Shortness of breath…at times when I don’t even feel anxious.","Hi Everyone.
1st time poster; long time follower.

The quick back story:
5 years ago during the pandemic I had a serious of panic attacks about every 5 days and the whole experience lasted about 2 months; I thought I was losing my mind and spinning into deep psychosis. 
As the years passed and the panic attacks didn’t continue, the elevated anxiety slowly dissipated and life returned to normal. It has been at least 2-3 years since I even associated daily anxiety with my life. 
I have felt free.

Obviously the story continues seeing as how I am posting now.
Over the last year I noticed that after a night of heavier drinking, I’d have chest pain. About 9 months ago when I did a fitness challenge that required no drinking, the chest pain wasn’t present. After the challenge however, even with a casual balance of a drink here and there…it returned, but no longer on days after drinking. It just appeared at times.
Over the last year, I noticed that it occurred completely devoid of days or weeks with drinking. Perhaps I somehow convinced myself that I had some type of cardiac condition due to family lineage (which does exist).

Fast forward to present day.
Heart is still being funny with random chest pain as well as just going from 55 to 120 while being a normal casual person has become commonplace. And this is where I’m trying to understanding if it could all still be rooted in anxiety.
Over the last several months some big things have been happening; fully committed to relocating to a new state (history of travel nursing; on the go became normal), started a serious relationship (history of looking for casual as I always have gotten my heart broken), and several other big changes all manifesting at once.

2 weekends ago, there was a very stressful weekend that almost resorted in a panic attack…but things calmed down just before having one.
And I think I may have tapped the keg and put myself on high alert. Last week at work a wave came over me and I felt like I wanted to pass out; wanted to puke, wanted to shit, HR to 120, shortness of breathe, dizzy, nauseous; all of it.
My coworkers named me go to the ER and I got a full work up; blood samples, chest x-ray; I even wore a heart monitor for the last 7 days…but they all came back negative.

But nausea, weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath; it all seems to persist.
So here I find myself cycling through these symptoms at random with no discernible present cause in the day for suddenly switching into these symptoms.

Is it possible to remain in a physical state of anxiety with manifested symptoms even when not feeling anxious in that moment?
Am I somehow edging myself around a panic attack that didn’t fully manifest 2 weeks ago.
If the tests are coming back all showing that my body is indeed physically fine…can my history of anxiety be causing physical symptoms to persist at random as time continues forward?

Any personal stories or knowledge of physical symptom associated anxiety would be appreciated.

Thank you very much ",1755220220.0,1,1,Anxiety,anxiety

1mqj0ys,Son is scared to eat and drink.,"My six year old son had a spoon of soup with little pieces of steak in it. It went down his throat funny and it scared him. He didn't actually choke. But after that he didn't eat or drink for 24 hours. He would cry and run away and hide when we tried to get him to eat.

I ended up taking him to ER last night. Doctor said he is physically fine. They told him he couldn't leave the ER until he ate and drank. He did. After I took him to McDonald's (his favorite) and he ate most of it. That night he refused to eat cucumbers and popcorn (his favorite snacks) but ate some candy. 

Today though, same thing, he's scared eat most things. I took him out for McDonald's for lunch but this time he ate a lot less. He's refusing to eat soup or even just the broth. Doesn't want to drink gaterade or juice.

He said at the ER he's scared to die by swallowing funny again. We gently encouraged him to eat. I showed him pics I took from the ER and McDonalds of how well he ate. But his anxiety is off the charts.

I just want to say that you have power, you have wants. You are a human being who deserves every right/want. You have power, you have joy, you can feel again.

Some of us die because we believe that we are not wanted, that no one in the world relates to us. I relate to you, and I love you. Every one of us who feels this way.

I want to begin by saying I’m an anxious person and shy/quiet as well. I took this job to push myself out my comfort zone. Today a phone call came of a person inquiring about getting an eye exam for his mom who has cataracts. It was a longer call with a lot of info being thrown that I wasn’t understanding. Long story short, I didn’t understand properly and noted down wrong info and went to tell the doctor to call them back. A bit after the call the doctor comes to me and tells me to come with her to the break room and sits next to down. And she says “the information you have is entirely incorrect”. Then she says “I’m coming from a place of care and concern but I want to know why you’re so overwhelmed and what’s holding you back. Maybe you need something like therapy to help you gain confidence and increase the communication skills”. Then she said “it’s been 8 weeks since you’ve worked here and you’re still having trouble with insurance and the basics”. She ended it off by saying she thinks we were meant to be together this summer so that I could get a push to change for the better, and I had to promise her I wouldn’t quit the job. I cried during this conversation as well, primarily when she said to look into therapy bc it may be something external causing this.

Insurance stuff is difficult and every patient is different, so I think that is just something that comes with practice. But I feel really terrible about myself bc it’s different when someone calls you out on it. Esp when it’s things you know (I was thinking about all the things she said to me). She told me to try and make convo with patients but it’s just something always holding me back. I also feel like I get brain fog a lot - which is why I struggle to understand these complicated phone calls. Maybe it’s the anxiety?

It was a bit awkward bc the door was open so the other coworkers def heard lol. Going back to the front desk was awkward.

I’ve always been a guy full of energy, I used to enjoy everything around me, and everyone who knows me would smile when they saw me — that’s what gave me joy. But now I feel depressed, I’m having panic attacks, and I feel like I’m not the same person anymore. Sometimes I just feel like crying. I should also mention that I smoke… and when I do, these thoughts get even more intense compared to when I’m sober. I honestly need some advice — from the bottom of my heart. I just want to be who I used to be again…”
only good wishes 🙏🏽🙏🏽

1mqfsms,Trouble breathing/chest tightness,"Over a month ago it was the last night of June, and I started to notice almost a weird chest tightness/pressure and like I could never get enough air. Especially if I really focused on it. I would take the biggest breath of air I could and hold it for two seconds before feeling like I was running out of breath for some reason. It wouldn’t even really go away when I laid down unless I laid on my stomach because I was putting pressure on my chest so I guess I just couldn’t feel it as much because I was laying on it.

I went to urgent care after a week of it still being there and they checked my vitals and said everything was fine, but since I checked off I had anxiety they said it can sometimes subconsciously cause chest tightness or trouble breathing and that it was normal. I’m 18 and only just recently started going to therapy for my anxiety because it seemed like my mental health was getting worse especially with the stress of my first year of college coming up.

They prescribed me an inhaler which I used a few times before stopping because it wasn’t helping and almost made it feel worse. Unfortunately I couldn’t hold myself back and tried edibles rather than my cart, and noticed that when I started to get high, I felt the muscles in my abdomen tightening up and like my heart was beating really fast (which could very well just be me focusing on it and making it go crazy but still).

I’ve now completely stepped away from weed which used to be one of the things that used to help with my anxiety, and I finally met with a psychiatrist to start taking 5mg lexapro everyday and just started it today. 

Over time I haven’t been as worried about this chest pressure because I’ve just gotten so used to it the past month plus, but I want to know if anyone else has or is experiencing anything like this and if it ever went away with the use of medicine. I just want this to go back to normal and not feel unnecessarily out of breath so much. Pls help

1mq9fpp,I have no idea what's going on or what to do (heart anxiety?),"Before reading, please acknowledge that I know next to nothing about anxiety (never had anxiety that I know of), and I'm currently in a pretty bad state so please excuse my potentially bad or chaotic writing.

To preface this I'd like to bring a bit of (possibly related) context:  
A few months ago, I signed up for two programs on a university: robotics and biomedical engineering (I had the option to choose later between the two). The university invited me (and other applicants) for a tour of the different labs to see what we'll be doing and ask the professors all kinds of questions, etc.

On the biomedical engineering tour there were two labs with heart-related measuring devices, and we had the chance to get ourselves a scan to see if we had a ""scar"" (from a mini heart attack if I understood correctly) on our heart. Nobody got one and I felt ashamed to be the only one getting this kind of scan, so I didn't get it either.

  
Ever since my visit (end of June), I've been overthinking that decision. What if I have a scar and don't know it? All these what-ifs grew into a big ""What if I have a heart condition?"". This overthinking has been going for a couple of days usually after 8PM when I was laying in bed, usually until I just fell asleep.  
Then, I started feeling pain on the left side of my chest (not a sharp or really bad pain, kind of pulsing and just uncomfortable). Sometimes I get pain over different parts of my chest/stomach, but mostly it's just around my heart.

It's gotten so uncomfortable (and I've gotten so afraid) it prevented me from sleeping almost every night now, with me having to play games on my phone and literally drain myself mentally enough for me to just close my phone and fall asleep almost instantly. After maybe a week I noticed a pattern: All day I was just fine, maybe the chest pain started for a few seconds or minutes but went away, then at around 6-8PM it all started until I just fell asleep (sometimes at 10PM when I'm already very tired, on normal days it can be as late as 3AM). So I figured my pain might not be real, but it might be just my mind playing tricks. During the evenings I experienced a bit higher heartbeat, sweating and fear, though not every time I have felt these.

A few days ago it has gotten worse up to the point where I'm sort of in a state of ""mild panic"", where I can't think as clearly as normally and feel a slight pressure on my chest along with an elevated heartbeat.

I believe the university visit and the later doubt about my health started all this, along with some other factors (I failed my finals in school this year, and the next try is getting close with me still not knowing as much as I should).

Lastly, I've talked about this to my mom, who told me it's going to go away and it's probably because of school (finals) and gave me these Lavekan pills (lavender essential oil something, it's supposed to calm your nervous system and all. not medication, just supplement) and they seem to help a tiny bit, but I can still feel all the bad stuff.

  
Do these evening ""episodes"" sound like anxiety? Can it come and go away on its own? I'll be on holiday for the next week, so should I plan a visit to a doctor or wait until finals again (2 weeks after I come back from the holiday) to see if it goes away?

Again I'm sorry if this post is chaotic or hard to understand, part of this post has been written during my mind flying all over so it took me almost an entire hour to write this.

Getting ready for work/party/event/errands and I lose the top I picked out or realize I’m running a little behind? I immediately start panic sweating and end up being more late bc I have to lay down and stop it in order to get dressed. 

Someone strikes up a non work-related convo at work? Lip sweat IMMEDIATELY 
In a store for more than 15 minutes? The sweat just starts everywhere. 
I START a convo with someone I WANT to talk to? You guessed it- sweat!
I literally am anywhere in public where I feel too perceived? S.W.E.A.T. 

And it’s the worst sweat. I’ve read panic sweat is actually THICKER than normal sweat!!! Google it I stg😭 starts in my scalp and upper lip. It’s contributed to skin issues as well. Goodbye styled hair and full face of makeup. It makes me run late because I constantly have to pause and cool down. I bother everyone around me because I need the room or car to feel like the arctic in order to relax. I always have to dress in darn near skimpy clothes at gatherings bc I have to assume it’ll be hot- even in the winter people blast their heat so I’m in tube tops all year long. Might bring a top sweater in the winter for appearances. 
Most of all it’s starting to feel like a form of torture to be this hot all the time. Rarely am I comfortable. My family tries to accommodate me but even those accommodations are just keeping me from breaking down. I look ugly and gross in pics due to the sweat messing me up. I get frustrated easily. Can’t focus on tasks if I’m too hot. Hard to clean if I’m too hot. Etc etc etc.

One was my friend of 4 years (9th to 12th.) when I caught her taking one and she then showed me her phone of all the pictures she had of me since she first met me. (I forgive her cus she said it was something she does with her friends.) but also my co worker from a previous job recorded me to get me fired and talk shit about me behind my back. Due to these and some other things I’ve been slowly growing more panicked and paranoid about my job ever since it looked like someone was as taking a picture of me during work. I know I’m slow in there eyes because I process things slower then others so I get why they are frustrated but I can’t take it. Now I’m so so paranoid and anxious about cameras around me.

1mqdrxz,"Too anxious to take the thing that’s supposed to help my anxiety (military,  need alertness at work)","Hi everyone, 

I was recently prescribed hydroxyzine hydrochloride 25 mg tablets for acute anxiety. From what I’ve read and heard, it’s pretty common for this medication to just make people tired, so a lot of folks end up taking it at night instead.

Here’s my concern — my anxiety is usually worst during the day, especially while I’m at work. The past two days have been rough; I’ve been spiraling over feeling like I keep messing things up and worrying that someone’s going to complain about me. It’s gotten to the point where I can barely focus because I’m so caught up in what I think I did wrong and the fear of someone going to my boss over it. I really need something that can help me stay calm and functional during those hours, but it can’t make me drowsy since I need to be able to drive and stay alert.

I’m trying to figure out what I should bring up to my doctor in terms of other options or adjustments. Also worth noting — I’m active duty military, so certain medications (like benzodiazepines or anything with strong sedative effects) might be off the table for me due to duty requirements.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What medications or approaches worked for you during the day without affecting alertness?

Thanks in advance for any advice or experiences you can share!

1mqdivk,When to worry about chest tightness?,"Hi all, 

New to this, but not new to anxiety lol. Recently I have found that I am randomly getting chest tightness and sometimes these stabbing pains in my chest. For example, at the grocery store yesterday I could feel the chest tightness and was convinced my heart was going to stop (ridiculous I know). I’ve had similar symptoms before, had a chest ultrasound, stress test, EKG, everything but the 48 hr monitor. 

This was about a year ago, and the cardiologist said that everything was fine. However, with these symptoms returning it has caused a great spike in my health anxiety. I am diagnosed with GERD and that is what these symptoms have been attributed to, but I’m not sure, I feel like I’m always convincing myself that it’s something worse because in the moment it feels so distressing.

A slew of other symptoms to which my ENT said I likely have a form of chronic vestibular migraine or PPPD.

1mqcupx,Torturous Burnouts From Physical Anxiety Every Single Day,"I am trapped in a cycle of relentless burnout that hits me hard every single day, dragging me into a pit of despair that feels like absolute torture.

In 2024,

I was suffocating under the weight of exhaustion, sleeping away most of my days just to get away from the overwhelming burden of it all. It was a continual drain on my motivation, a physical pain that would not subside, and an anger that simmered over too easily, compounding everything. I was put on a plethora of medications, but I know in my heart I never required them. They were totally unnecessary, and that misguided treatment has brought me to my breaking point.

In 2024, I changed from Adderall to Vyvanse. However, I never really had any idea what Vyvanse was doing to me at the time. My whole day would be ruined and I would end up accomplishing nothing, paralyzed, if I had one negative thought. In 2025, when my twin brother tried Vyvanse simply to see if it would last longer than Adderall, he experienced the very same thing that I did, which finally assured me what that medication had been doing all along, I changed back to Adderall, which is somewhat more tolerable, yet still intolerable, providing only moderate relief from the agony.

This month, August 2025, I simply want to have normal, good days. But every single day, it is never really a good day. Most days, I can find happiness, but the moment that stabbing pain hits, it overpowers all that I found happiness in. It's like the pain sucks in the light and makes me feel like the day went to waste, even if it did not. I simply to feel alive and fine, but those days slip away from me. Instead, I am left with moments that are either barely tolerable or downright miserable. Joy or even peace of mind is so little it hurts, suffocated by this exhausting fight that makes staying awake feel like warfare, though I'm not physically tired as I was before, it's just only anxiety, burnouts & most stressful of it all, my loss of motivation.

I was weighed down last year by a cocktail of medications that turned me into a zombie, sapping my energy and conflicting with my ADHD medication so that within an hour it was useless. I was done by October, exhausted with the haze and the fight, and I kicked all of those extra meds cold turkey. The next day, my Adderall worked again, like I'd flipped a switch. As I fought to crawl my way back over the period of the next two months, I started to notice this sharp, stabbing pain in the top of my abdomen — a physical kind of anxiety that is quite frankly traumatizing. Every terrible thought and every critical word activates it like a button, and I'm left depleted and raw. Once it's been hit, I'm so sensitive that even small stress feels like a personal attack and gets blown out of proportion into something I'm not able to handle.

This pain is the source of everything. It feeds my rage and despair, and it is why I am so defended even though I am not the type of person who wishes to lash out and smash things. When I talk to my family, except for my twin brother, I am overly careful about what I say for fear of a critical comment. Even one little critical statement is harmful to me mentally, and then physically, due to how it provokes that same stabbing pain and anxiety spiral. When I am already under stress or someone does or says something that initiates that stress, I explode. My short fuse burns quickly and it is so difficult to let go because I am excruciatingly aware that it is happening. That self-awareness makes it even more difficult to rein it in, like I am helpless to watch myself spiral. Even a harmless comment from somebody feels like they are against me, like they are criticizing what I am trying to do, and it cuts deep, leaving me alone and rejected. Just the thought of the burnout returning and fearing it before I even begin something sends it crashing down on me, like I am calling it forth myself. It is a vicious cycle that I cannot seem to break. Yet, there are times when I cling to my aspirations, clutching that vision like it is the only life jacket keeping me from drowning in this mess.

My mind is a battlefield at all times, making even neutral or positive thoughts heavy and dark. I did not use to notice it as much before, but now I am painfully aware of this symptom, and it is the worst thing possible I have ever felt, darkening nearly every day of 2024 and now 2025 with this quiet, gnawing suffering. I try to avoid it and not succumb, but things like seeing my mom upset or sad send me spiraling into anxiety so terrible I get sick and nauseous, like I am falling apart. Even frustrating sounds like the sound of iPhone typing or another person's keyboard get under my skin, bringing on ridiculous anger that I have a short fuse for, which gets directed inward, making me hate myself for feeling this way. I am so angry at myself for these weaknesses and for these things I have no control over, and it feels so unfair, like I do not deserve this. I am only 19 years old and I do not want problems. Currently, I take Adderall ER but am changing to immediate release 20 mg twice daily, and buspirone 5 mg and diazepam 5 mg. I have searched high and low for nearly two years to resolve these problems, seeking answers, attempting various methods, and challenging myself to become relieved.

1mqcmgd,Light at the end of the tunnel?,"Hello Reddit.

I've always been a anxious person, back in January though I suffered a severe panic attack (my first) I'm a 34yr male.

It left me so confused as to why it happened but fast forward to now I've totally accepted it was through heavy alcohol use since 2020/1, I'd drink everyday or at least every other day upwards of 8 glasses of vodka (50ml) in each to deal with past trauma, I'd use it to numb my anxiety and forget about things not realising now in the long run how bad it would actually make my anxiety, I've accepted I probably fried my nervous system.

Since the panic attack happened I became severely anxious and developed agoraphobia, my panic attack happened as a car passenger and since then whenever I've tried to be a passenger, ride a bus, train etc I'd notice my chest tightening, shortness of breath and pins and needles going through my hands and fingers (that's just a few of the physical side effects to be named).

Again, since then I've still had alcohol although cutting it down quite considerably compared to before, 3 or 4 glasses on every other day, still not the way to go but a coping mechanism, for some reason and a blessing.. Sunday the 3rd of August I had my last drink and decided to go cold turkey, fortunately not suffering any sort of withdrawal symptoms and today marks day 11 sober!

I decided I'd had enough of feeling the way I do and there's only one real way to deal with it, cut the drink out and let my mind heal and combine it with exposure therapy, I've been using ChatGPT as my therapist due to major trust issues surrounding humans, on Sunday 10th of August I took the metro/train 2 stops to see how I'd cope, noticing my chest tightening and feeling the anxiety coming on I got off and began to relax again, I had just done something I probably wouldn't of dreamt of doing before hand, day 2 I had took the metro/train 8 stops! again, fuelled with anxiety and physical symptoms but I made it then had a little walk around and took 8 stops back home, this time I noticed I was a bit calmer, day 3 I done the same this time but about half way there was a delay and I noticed I didn't have the same anxious flare up I usually would have, it was stable rather than getting to the point where I feel I need to get off, day 4 and day 5 I have noticed when first getting on the metro/train I don't feel as anxious as day 1, 2 & 3, I even managed to get on a bus to go back home (32 minutes total journey) once I got off it was like a breath of fresh air, I had just done something that before would leave my chest tight, leave me breathless, hands in pins and needles, feeling faint, everything severe thinking I will lead to another full blown panic attack, I barely had any physical symptoms and I'm amazed, it's giving me positive energy to keep going and going.

I have done 5 days in a row so far, doing it scared, doing it anxious, ChatGPT tells me if I can keep this up (not overdoing it) and resting on a day if I need to that my brain will rewire and no longer treat these type of situations as danger to myself, I truly believe it, I'm early days in but starting to feel it already, I'm going to keep on going and try different things.

I thought I would be trapped with these feelings forever, because January to August let's face it is a long time for nothing really to get better or improve massively, for some reason I think my mind had just had enough with alcohol for me to go cold turkey like that, it's gave me energy to go and do these things, exposure therapy, determination, feeling like there is light at the end of the tunnel after all!

So currently I'm on 25 mg metoprolol 2x daily for a combination of BP/anxiety control

Been on them maybe 5 months, but the lingering and constant side effects for me ( sour stomach, no appetite, fatigue) had me considering asking for a change

I asked for propranolol since I have read a lot about it being better for anxiety, the NP at my cardiologist gave me 60 mg ER propranolol ER, and said to keep my Metoprolol as a ""as needed"" med ( and that I could take it in addition on the days I have a panic episode) 

So mainly I'm curious if anyone has experience with 1 or both

Metoprolol has controlled my BP perfectly from 160s/100s to mostly 110-130s/80-90 but the side effects don't seem to let up for me( she did also mention pro does less for bp than me to)

She also advised I could just swap over since they were both low doses of each medicine, without doing it gradually or weening


My main concern is the ER Pro actually being able to control my anxiety dumps for 24 hours, because mentally on the IR meto I can feel the effects wearing off before the 2nd dose (which I think has given me a couple episodes just based off pure anxiety about it)


Any input from your personal experience on the BP/anxiety effects of it would be appreciated, I'm hoping it keeps me off Buspar as I don't want to be on any more meds than needed",1755204146.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

1mplhif,Misdiagnosed - hypothyroidism!,"Hi all. I just wanted to flag something which many may be aware of anyway

I (29, F, London, UK) went to the doctors recently to revisit the idea of going back on antidepressants/anti anxiety meds. I have been on Sertraline previously and tried various different therapy methods, which worked and symptoms alleviated for a while, but have since returned.

This time, I had a wonderful young female doctor who saw me deeply, and, among other things, suggested doing a blood test to rule out any potential physical/physiological causes or contributing factors. 

Well, the results came back and turns out I have an extremely high TSH level (thyroid hormone). For context, a normal level (I think) is between 4 and 11, mine was 30. 

This means my thyroid gland is under-active and therefore I’m experiencing all the textbook symptoms of depression and anxiety.
I was taken aback at first, and actually laughed when the numbers were read out to me. I have no idea how long this has been going on or how long it’s been affecting me. Honestly, in terms of my symptoms, it feels like over a year.

I’ve since been referred to a specialist and I’m now on the journey towards addressing this issue through medication, which could take a while to get right.

It’s a little scary, but I was genuinely relieved that there was a reason I felt this way, chemically, and that a wonderful doctor had the correct and sensible approach to my care. 

This post is to encourage any women and men to advocate for yourself. PUSH for something if you don’t feel right. 

I mean, in the US you pay hard money for that healthcare so make them work for it!
And in the UK, we also pay for it through our taxes. Trust your gut, find that wonderful medical profession, and live your life to the fullest❤️

1mq47ej,Waves of Anxiety and Stomach Issues,"I have GAD, PTSD and have suffered with Health Anxiety since I was 12. I’m now 42. Recently I’ve changed my diet, come off medications (lexapro which I took for 10 years - been off for over a year) and went from almost 300 pounds to 215 pounds. Mainly from lifting weights 3 times a week and operating at a calorie deficit. A couple of weeks ago I noticed my irritability and anxiety starting to ramp up. My appetite disappeared and the anxiety was so bad I could hardly swallow food.  We went on a family vacation for a week and I had a complete collapse (bad stomach issues, worst anxiety of my life, brain was completely haywire) and ended up in the ER. Everything came back fine and he gave me Xanax to get me through until I got home. Last few days have been up and down I’ve reached out to my primary and he prescribed BuSpar but I haven’t picked it up yet because yesterday my wife made me sourdough bread with avocado on it and miraculously my anxiety shut off like I took a Xanax. I started to look back at my diet and realized I cut out carbs almost completely the last few weeks and didn’t realize it. I think my body went into ketosis and I didn’t know it. My question is this, I’m trying to rebuild my gut because it’s a mess from the last few weeks but I’m getting weird symptoms. If I don’t eat every couple hours the anxiety comes back, when I do eat it subsides but as the food moves through my digestive tract I get waves of anxiety as it reaches certain points in my system. Has anyone else experienced this? Will these waves of anxiety eventually stop once my stomach is back on track? Part of me is saying it’s normal from the stress of the last few weeks and it will keep getting better but heath anxiety is telling me it could be something more serious.

1mq9t7u,"okay, but why am i anxious about this *now*?","my anxiety has latched onto a new thing recently - menopause! and in general i'd say that's a valid thing to be worried about. it's a long, transitional period full of a bunch of uncomfortable symptoms (a lot of which people don't ever warn you about) and then when you're finally done with it you have to adjust to whatever your new normal looks like for the rest of your life. if i was approaching menopausal age then i'd totally get why i'm anxious about it. 

but i'm 21. it's probably going to be at least another 21 years before i start even perimenopause, so why am i worrying about this now?

all the things i've read from women who are experiencing menopause make it seem (at least to me) like it's a never ending hellscape where you entirely lose your sex drive, your vagina dries up and atrophies, you don't want anybody to touch you ever, you start to hate the person you married, you don't have the energy for anything, you're anxious, full of regrets about your life and you can't stop thinking about your own mortality. i don't think i can deal with all of that :(

logically i know people make posts about their symptoms when they're at their breaking point and that life as a woman isn't always miserable after you turn 50. i also know it's an extremely stupid thing to worry about because the only way that it isn't going to happen to me is if i die before my 40s, and that's definitely the worse option. but for some reason i just can't stop thinking about it.

1mpy7b2,I am 98% sure I'm going to be terminated not even 2 months into my probationary period. What should I do?,"

A month ago, I acquired a job at MCEC (Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre) as a casual catering attendant. It is my first ever actual job besides the measly work experience I picked up in highschool and I really like it.

I cannot shake off the feeling that I have a microscope focused on me by the management team, which is probably true because I always keep making (although minor) mistakes at work and my anxiety spikes throughout the day the more it happens.

I keep telling myself that it's okay to cut myself some slack since I've never had any proper prior hospitality experience and this is a stepping stone but the management team likely won't see it that way during my 3 - 6 month probationary period.

Multiple of them repeatedly tell me me to do different things at a time, then one or the other gets mad at me for doing what I was told to. The blame gets put on me anyway because I'm a new hire and then it makes me look bad which gets considered as a factor in the performance review that decides if I'm a good fit for the job or not. 

I really like this job even though it's a 1.5 hour commute. The pay is great and the people are nice but I feel like I don't belong here, and at the same time I'd feel ashamed if I messed it up, mostly because a relative helped me get it and I don't want to let them down.

1mpzgof,How to deal with anxiety about transitions?,"I have a lot of anxiety about transitions. 

For me, it’s when transitions are so sudden and I’m not prepared for them, but it can also happen when I am prepared for them. 

Today I have to go back to my apartment in another city (I go there for school). I haven’t been there in four weeks, so I have a lot of anxiety about going back. 

Thing is, I know once I’m there for a few days I’ll be fine, but it’s just getting back into it and being by myself. I know I’ll probably be miserable for a few days before I finally get used to being back. 

But I’m only spending a week there before I go back home. However, I hope to spend a few days at home during this before I go back again and hopefully stay for a few weeks (school for me starts back up in September).

1mq5cyg,my anxiety has gotten worse and i might drop out because of it,"i’ve had anxiety for a few years now, which i’ve been able to manage pretty well. i’ve gotten better at ignoring the stomachaches, the anxiety chills, and the shaky feeling in my body when i’m stepping into an uncomfortable situation. i’ve attended therapy, started taking meds, started volunteering at an animal shelter to socialize with others, and also started school. 

however recently i feel like my anxiety has gotten extremely bad. i don’t take my meds consistently like i should, and i haven’t been to therapy for almost two years, but i’ve been fine. it started about a week and a half ago. i planned to go to a bulk store with my sister but while i was getting ready i started to feel sick and shaky. when we got to the store i went in and immediately headed to the bathroom, feeling like i was going to have a panic attack. i felt trapped and like i needed to escape the store. it was an odd feeling, a feeling like as though i had to leave or i wasn’t safe. after i came from the bathroom i told my sister and went to sit in the car while she shopped. 

then it progressed. while i was walking my dog, a homeless man appeared walking on the other end of the sidewalk. i usually turn around at this point so thats what i did. then i heard him calling for me from behind and got extremely paranoid. i swear i heard him call for me. i stepped off to the side to let him pass because i felt weird with him behind me, but when he passed he wasn’t even looking my way or speaking at all. two nights later while im walking my dog i could’ve sworn to hear two young girls screaming at me for help from the darkness. i immediately turned around and went back home. i still don’t know if i actually heard anything or not.

as for school, im currently in the middle of an internship for clinical hours and i’ve missed a week so far and i’ve only been in one day this week. i’m close to getting terminated from my current location and this is my third time attempting internship with my mental health issues. i feel like im being a complex student which isn’t fair to my advisor, so i’ve considered dropping out altogether. i only have two more weeks left however (10 days, not including weekends) before i get my certification and am done with school altogether, so i feel stupid even considering unenrollment. idk what to do and i don’t want to mess everything up.",1755188590.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

1mq4zx2,Anxiety/stress causing me to make mistakes 2 days in a row now at work,"I work in patient registration at a local hospital. A week or so ago I had a patient fill out a form right as we were doing a desk change so I could take my lunch and in the rush of things I mistakenly put the clipboard back with the form still on it in our pile of clipboards behind the desk instead of where completed forms go so one of our techs couldn't find it (she did eventually, but I was already on my lunch and blissfully unaware I had done that by that point). Long story short, the tech in question took it upon herself to report me to management for a ""potential HIPAA violation"".

I had to have a talk with my own supervisor a few days ago over it and she was really understanding that it was an honest mistake. Well, the next day I was so incredibly anxious that I was reported for a potential HIPAA violation that I was making mistakes left and right all day, and like an absolute idiot I put the wrong patient label on a form (the label has a pt's first and last name, DOB, and their medical record number). I was *mortified* and immediately told me supervisor what had happened and was apologizing profusely. She again was very understanding. To top it all off, I just did it again today as we had two patients with the same name and I mistakenly swapped the labels on the two forms.

I quite literally have been trying to keep myself from crying all morning because I'm realizing that I've been so incredibly anxiety-ridden over that tech reporting me that I've been making mistakes left and right since that day. I feel like I'm causing a self-fulfilling prophecy and I'm so hyper focused on doing everything right that somehow I'm missing things at the same time. I realize that in the grand scheme of things I could have committed *much* worse, but the fact I've done this 3 times in the span of a week has me completely freaked out and I'm not sure how to break the cycle of making mistakes due to the mounding anxiety.",1755187804.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

Im 21F and have decided to got back to school to get better education and today was the first day. I've been spiraling because of it for weeks now and spend the whole day yesterday doing nothing- I couldnt eat or drink, cried all day and suffered at least 2 panic attacks because I just couldnt handle the thought of attending school again- new people, a big class, doing presentations, spending most of my day there and doing shit I swore i'd never do again (the degree I have atm isnt bad, I just dont know what to do instead of school).

That being said- I couldnt sleep the whole night, woke up after barely 2 hours with a pounding headache, stomach ache (from not being able to eat) and feeling weak af. So I decided ok, I'll just go on monday, missing the first two days is shit but what can I do? I can barely stand, let alone exist in the heatwave we have here lately, so I wrote an email to the school and passed out again almost immidiatly.

The thing is- my anxiety and depression are pretty bad lately, idk what made me think going on monday would make it easier- it will probably be even harder since I missed all importend infos and dont even know where my classroom will be by then. Everyone else will already have meet each other and I will be the weird one again who showed up two days late and missed everything. 

Im scared I wont be able to go next week, that my anxiety will completely overwhelm me again and wont be strong enough again to do something about it. Im an adult and I feel 10000% pathetic for handling things like this. Its embarrassing.

1mpw0va,Lexapro side effects eight years later,"I’ve been on lexapro for as long as I can remember. However, I never really experienced many of the positives of what people say here. I still suffered from extreme anxiety crying , etc.. and recently asked my doctor to add my dose thinking that is what I needed. I kind of just assumed that was my way of life. However, one thing that I did not realize was related to Lexapro was irritability. I will get annoyed at the slightest thing, and would not be able to regulate enough to have a conversation with my partner, causing them to have to walk on eggshells. I would embarrassingly have such big blowups that I have lost so many people in my life. (TBH I don’t know why my current partner staying with me.), but I’m grateful that they are.. happened until recently I was taking prazosin, adderal and lexapro and it was terrible.
I asked to switch back to Vyvanse  and it was great, I pointed out that the anxiety was still there so my doctor gave me Wellbutrin, but said we might have to try something more aggressive that doesn’t work. So I was now on a Vyvanse. Wellbutrin, lexapro prazosin combo. There were a few days. I forgot to take my Lexapro and I was so much more clearheaded so much less irritable and could have conversation that were not self-centered and I did not blow up. I messaged my doctor today and we are going to be done tapering off, but I’m so scared because I don’t want this irritability to affect anything else before I’m done. I feel embarrassed by the pain, I’ve caused others, in particular my partner when I couldn’t regulate myself. It got to the point where I thought that I might be bipolar…. But I’m not. 
I guess I’m posting here to ask people who have had the irritability and blowups before how it worked when they tapered, I also just want to feel like maybe I’m not alone in this. I never wanna hurt somebody and knowing that I was because of this medication makes me so sad.

1mpxnic,I think I have serious health problems and I don’t know if it’s just anxiety.,"24m obese. I think I’m going crazy because of my symptoms and my health anxiety. I keep seeing posts on reddit with health anxiety and they have nausea, headache, or any general symptoms while I have very specific symptoms like my lower abdomen, testes, throat, and lower back hurts. Some symptom goes away after 2-3 days and some are reocurring for just a few secondd and my mind goes to very severe illnesses and at worse I think I have cancer that has metastasized. I know I should get checked and I currently am but I’m just so confused and sad of living with health anxiety that it makes me question whether I have an actual severe illness.

My health anxiety started just a month ago when my left eye started seeing flashes. I travelled to a different city and rode a bus for 7 hours just to go to the best eye facility just to make sure I was okay. I was relatively okay after that, but just a few weeks ago I had the worst panic attack because I think my father has rabies due to him having a stomach ache for a few days (I keep forcing him to have a rabies shot everyday but he refuses because he was just scratched lightly by a cat). This is the event that actually got me spiraling with my health anxiety. I couldn’t sleep and have constant fear that my father has rabies. Since then I also had stomach pain and so many different symptoms suddenly coming out that I don’t know if it’s just a wild coincidence, i’m really sick, or i’m just going crazy with my health anxiety. I went to the doctor and had tests done but i’m still not satisfied with the results and want more and more tests done. 

I’m sorry if the post is rambly. I just want to share my thoughts because I rarely see people post on reddit about health anxiety but actually have so much specific symptoms.

Please don't ignore,"Hello, I've been suffering from constant anxirty and lately intrusive thoughts as a result of a panic attack that occurred in January, so roughly 6-7 months. First my theme was fear of psyhosis/going crazy from which I suffered deeply, bit thankfully it doesn't bother me so much anymore and I have mostly been free from these thoughts.  This could've very much been a victory post and oh how much I wish it was the case until a new theme appeared. 

Approximately a week ago I started getting harm intrusive thoughts and urges centered around my loved ones, like id get tickles in my arms and my legs would feel light. I saught reassurance 24/7 if this was a symptom of anxiety/ocd which it appeared to be and I was sort of relieved. However the final straw was when I went out with my parents and I started to have thoughts and urges stronger than before to attack people. It'd get accompanied by thoughts like ""what's the need of being adequate? Just do whatever you want. It's so easy anyway."" This almost led to an anxiety attack and I had to find an excuse to leave the store. I was praying afterwards. 

After that every day i wake up with these thoughts and they're basically with me 24/7. I also have patience and anger issues. And whats scary is that imo they don't cause me as much anxiety as they should've after that incident. They FEEL real. Like I still get distressed by them and perform a compulsion like reassurance seeking and repeat certain phrases to feel better, but still. It can be undiagnosed OCD or something else..

	•	Early on: GI issues (seem to be slowly improving)
	•	Ongoing: dizzy/floaty head feeling that comes and goes
	•	Fatigue at times
	•	Some initial anxiety spikes

Symptom-wise, I have seen progress. I haven’t had a panic attack in almost two months except for one recent episode, and my anxiety overall is more manageable. That said, I still have low-level anxiety most days, especially anticipatory anxiety.

My therapist mentioned that I could consider a cross taper to Lexapro if I wanted, as some people tolerate it better. I’m conflicted — I’m scared to switch because I’ve made progress on Zoloft, and I don’t want to go backwards or restart the adjustment phase. On the other hand, I’m wondering if Lexapro could give me the same benefits without the lingering side effects.

Has anyone here:
	•	Switched from Zoloft to Lexapro?
	•	Done a cross taper instead of a full stop/start?
	•	Found that sticking it out on Zoloft eventually resolved side effects like dizziness?

Would love to hear real-life experiences — good or bad — so I can make a more informed decision.

Thanks in advance!

1mq0r2f,"Anxiety for years, randomly pops up","So back in 2017 I had my first real panickattack.
Ive always been a anxious guy, ever since childhood; but nothing like that. 
It was like it was the mother of all attacks, as ive never had such a big one since.

I woke up, felt weird and my breathe got weird; Like I was frozen solid and couldnt breathe. My muscles froze too and I couldnt move; I started shaking and was terrified. Stuck and confused. My SO at the time wqs there, and what I tought was 20 min was closer to TWO hours lol.

Ever since that, anxiety and panick has been a part of my life. I lost my job and sat wt home terrified for a year. 

Ever since ive tried to ""beat"" it. At least not met it control my life. 
But in so sick of it flaring randomly up. Showing up, time after time; not being able to enjoy life. As situations you should be present is all about getting trough and not run.

It feels like i never will get rid lf this shit, and it makes me so tired and depressed when one day I suddenly cant breathe and feel like im gonna have a heartattack whole day lol. 
I know what it is, whats going on, what to do; and ai must ride the waves. 

My attacks seems to loop and linger. And I end up in hypervigilance. My brain scans before ai even get q chance to think about scanning my body sensations. Feels like im playing pingpong with my thoughts, constant countering them with reason and calm. 

Weirdly im scared of dying, but a few weeks of this and sleepless nights; I pray that If i do fall asleep; i dont wake up.

And thats not me. I love life, ai love my loved ones. Theres so mutch i want to do; and I do it! Regardless.
But it never goes away 😭 It keeps showing up randomly again, spiraling me in a loop for a few days. 

Seeing my kid win at soccer for example during theese times; Gives me nothing, its a charade so people wont notice im trembling with fear and Feel like Im choking. Its ridiculous!

This ended up being a big rant.

Ive also learned alot about myself from this. 
but ive had enough! I feel like im not in control! And therapy doesnt do shit. Ive done everything they told me and it still keeps coming back

Anyobe done something gamechanging that worked? ",1755178259.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1mpw0bc,Severe Panic Attacks from Sertraline,"I’m literally writing this from the ER.

About 2 weeks ago, I started sertraline 25 mg for anxiety. I took that for a week, then last Monday night I bumped up to 50 mg like my doctor said. I went to bed feeling fine.

The next morning, within 10 minutes of waking up, I was hit with the most severe panic attacks I’ve ever had in my life. We’re talking:
	•	Throwing up
	•	Cold chills
	•	Burning sensations
	•	Heart racing
	•	Struggling to breathe
	•	Brain fog
	•	Pacing in circles for hours or crying on the floor

They weren’t one-and-done either — I was getting 3–8 of these a day, all just as intense. Sometimes they’d come back-to-back with no break. That 50 mg dose was the last pill I took, but here I am, over a week later, still going through it.

That first morning, I ended up in the ER and they gave me Ativan. It stopped my brain from spiraling but didn’t touch the physical symptoms. My doctor then prescribed propranolol and clonazepam for the attacks. I followed instructions — still no relief. One night, I couldn’t sleep at all because I was stuck in an attack for hours, pacing until sunrise.

Since this started, I’ve lost 10 lbs because I can barely eat without feeling sick or throwing up. My brain just refuses to let me get food down. They thought I had an infection and put me on antibiotics, which made eating even harder. I stopped that per their instructions and tried switching to another med that they recommended but before I could even take the first dose, I went into a full-blown attack again.

It’s now 4 a.m., I haven’t eaten since yesterday (threw it up), and I haven’t slept. This all started the morning after upping my sertraline dose, and I’m losing my mind. I genuinely don’t understand how people live a normal life while having panic attacks this severe for hours, multiple times a day.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Is there anything I can do or figure out how or why this hit me out of nowhere?",1755164559.0,2,4,Anxiety,anxiety
1mq0j56,One panick attack & it’s ruining my life,"I (23F) have always had depression and anxiety show up in my life that stems from childhood trauma. But never to this degree.
I recently got into a relationship and went on a small trip with his family. Long story short I ended up having the worst panic attack I’ve ever experienced. During this time I was about three weeks off of my SSRI’s but obviously after the attack I went back on them fully.

Fast forward a month now and I still feel panicky doing almost anything by socially, especially if it involves my boyfriends family. My symptoms make me feel like I am going to faint, my stomach turns, and I get nauseous and there has been a few times where I have actually gotten sick. Just the thought of doing social things sends chills down my body. The only things that keeps me semi calm is Hydroxyzine but it makes me very tired. 

Is this something that just takes time to recover from? I want to see my doctor about it but I don’t want to be put on anymore meds. Any tips would be appreciated because I know this is no way to live and I don’t want it to ruin my relationship.",1755177722.0,1,1,Anxiety,anxiety

Daily, I have a throbbing sensation in the base of my throat. Typically it’s at the center, but sometimes it can be more to the left or right side. Sometimes I experience a flutter, other times it’s just one pound and it’s done. 

For a long time, years, I’ve been convinced that these are heart palpitations. I’ve been to the doctor, and been told that my cardiovascular health is excellent. I run about 20+ miles weekly. 

I thought perhaps my flutters were due to my birth control, so I’ve cut it out in hopes that I’d feel better. No such luck. 

My question; is it heart palpitations, is this sensation muscular? To my knowledge, I don’t have any digestive issues… the sensation gives me a lot of anxiety. I have so much trauma revolving around heart issues that I’m terrified.

I haven’t had a very good childhood on account of suffering a lot of abuse, mainly at the hands of my sister who has special needs and lashes out when she’s angry. One of her most common things to do is throw her toys at people, which have hit me in the head quite a few times (I’d estimate once every few weeks). These impacts have hurt but I’ve never had any symptoms of concussion as far as I’m aware. I now wear a hard hat around her to protect me from further head injuries. But I have become preoccupied with the fear that my past injuries have caused some serious brain injury or, at worst, that I will be developing CTE. Over my teenage years, I’ve definitely found it a lot harder to concentrate on things and remember things, as well as having emotional dysregulation, which obviously could be symptoms of a brain injury or early stage CTE and I’m so scared.

1mpstzw,I can’t enjoy my comforts anymore due to anxiety,"I have experienced periods of extreme anxiety multiple times before throughout the past 5 years, but usually it is linked to specific events or time periods. This means that I usually get really anxious leading up to the event and during the event but after it’s over I usually get back to my non-anxious self a few days or a week later. Even after a month long period of really bad anxiety I was enjoying things again after a week or two of the anxiety inducing event being over.

About 2 weeks ago I started feeling extremely anxious and I have felt this way since. It was triggered by multiple different things in my life at the moment, such as feeling isolated after being home from uni all summer and anxiety about starting my first 9-5 office job while living in a new city on my own. This has made it hard to deal with as there doesn’t feel like there’s an ‘end’ to this anxiety, especially as my job doesn’t start until September and then when I start the job I fear that the anxiety will just get even worse and last for months.

When I get anxious like this I can’t seem to enjoy any of the things I usually do, but the things that I can’t enjoy the most are watching YouTube or reading books. This is so hard for me as these two things are the biggest things for me to feel relaxed and comforted. They play a big part in my routine and are how I would chose to spend my free time but when I get anxious I have to replace them with being constantly active and doing something distracting. This is okay for a short period of time when I know I can go back to what I like soon, but with this anxiety I can’t see an end in sight or if I can it’s months away, so I feel so mentally exhausted because it feels like something so important from me has been taken away. I think this is also so difficult for me as I’m autistic. 

It’s especially hard in the mornings, as I would usually wake up around 7 and spend my morning watching YouTube or reading, making me happy and relaxed for the day ahead. Now I wake up at 5 with anxiety that I can’t get rid of and can’t watch YouTube or read, so I either have to get up and do things around the house or fall into doomscrolling. This makes every day miserable and I’m so scared that I won’t be able to get back to what I used to do, I want to be able to feel how I used to feel. Will I be able to feel normal again and fully relax? What can I do to fix this?

I want there to be a God because if there isn't one then there's no one to control things and make sure everything's going to be okay.

I just don't want to live some random short life and be gone forever. The forever part scares me it feels like there's no escape no matter what the outcome is it will be forever. Nothing after death, forever. Afterlife, forever. Reincarnation, forever. I can't escape it and I just feel like no matter what the outcome is it will be bad and it makes me so confused and scared.

Anytime I ever needed to call him to come to area he either ignores me or he takes a really long time to get to me. Way longer than it takes him for anyone else. He always gives me dirty looks like I’ve done something wrong. And lately he’s been trying to sneak around and watch me constantly and even has the plant manager sneaking around me too.

More energy, more motivation, less paranoia (since I don’t smoke anymore). However, one thing that hasn’t gotten better is my resting anxiety, in fact, it’s gotten worse. I’m not sure if it’s a long withdrawal from weed but I’ve heard people experiencing the effects 6 months and onward from quitting. If anyone has any experience with this, is currently dealing with it, or got over it, please let me know because the anxiety is pretty bad. It’s manageable but it definitely impacts my daily life.

1mpph0c,Phagophobia - It gets better!,"Phagophobia or the fear of swallowing is real. It happens to many people and you aren’t alone if you’re going through this. 

August 2024, I was traveling for about 13 total hours to Hawaii. I’ve flown there over 10 times within the last 2 years, so nothing new for me. We were in the middle of the ocean and I had hives on my lower back. It started spreading on my arm as well. This was shortly after having a meal on American Airlines. Didn’t think much of it then a few minutes go by and I’m having a lot of anxiety. I ask the flight attendant for any Benadryl or medication, but they aren’t able to help. A doctor on board comes back and helps then I go and sit down. It was scary thinking about my throat closing up from an allergic reaction. And we’re in the middle of the ocean. 

I’ve had one allergic reaction before from Keflex and my throat/face was actually closing. On my flight to Hawaii it wasn’t but maybe this triggered the past event. We landed in Hawaii and my hives came back, but more this time. My legs were covered. I took an allergy pill and Tylenol I believe (but could be wrong). Then I went to urgent care and they gave me a steroid shot and some pills. The woman working there had the same issue with hives after flying from Dallas to Hawaii on American. 

Maybe all of the medicine and things going on it caused my immune system and nervous system to completely be out of whack. I began having dry mouth and eating was difficult. Couldn’t eat a sandwich and at dinner completely had a full on panic attack. I’ve had anxiety but nothing to this extent. I couldn’t drink or eat and I was shaking. I’ve had a couple issues with choking in the past but it was only steak. I didn’t have steak at all this trip. 

I went to the hospital after a few days because I wasn’t eating and barely drank anything. They told me I was fine and healthy. Gave me some sort of anxiety med to help, but it made things much worse. I slept the whole day after taking it and had scary dreams. I couldn’t leave the hotel room. Had to take very small sips from protein drinks and water. My anxiety was through the roof. Any time I stepped out of the room, I felt like I was going to pass out and became dizzy. 

A bit more context. For months before the incident I was sick on and off very often. Right before leaving for Hawaii I was sick as well. I’m sure this played a part in what happened. A lot of new life stressors, started therapy and a lot of old trauma was brought up, and an incident occurred a week or two before leaving. This time I did choke a bit on steak and had an issue eating the next morning. No other issues before Hawaii though. 

I came back home and started therapy. Slowing increasing what I ate. It was tough, trust me. Mashed foods, yogurt, water, protein drinks. I lost 20+ pounds in 2 weeks. I’m not a very heavy person to begin with, so it was concerning. I found a speech therapist and in many ways, she saved my life. Worked with me twice a week, taught me all about swallowing and how it works. We did exposure therapy and ate together. I also continued speaking with my therapist on tools to calm down my anxiety. 

The biggest thing I realized is that I am safe and healthy. I had health anxiety and worried about every small thing I was feeling. Arm is scratchy, must be an allergic reaction. I worried about my throat closing up everyday. It’s been about a year but after constantly pushing myself to eat it’s gotten a lot better. Exposure therapy at home and in public has been huge. For some reason I eat better alone than in public, which seems counterintuitive. If people are around they can help, but my issue is the embarrassment of choking. Every bite my body went into shock and still sometimes does. But it’s gotten much better. I am eating 95% normally at home and about 60% outside. If you would have asked me 11 months ago if I would still be struggling, I would have told you no way. But I’m so proud of my progress. There were days I didn’t want to push anymore. Days I wanted to feel normal. Trust me, if you’re reading this and dealing with the same issues, it does get better. I’m not 100% and still struggle, but it gets better. The upper back and neck pain is still there but that’s me tensing up when I eat. It takes time and I’m doing my best to be patient. 

I know this was a very long message, but I always wished someone would explain their situation. It made me feel better to know I wasn’t alone. I wish you all the best.

1mpqkcu,Think twice when starting antidepressants during hard times.,"I've been on and off antidepressants with next to no side effects other than being jittery when starting but this time my anxiety is off the charts before I started them again, I have a health problem that can't be found and the ER doctor that can check on me for it is on vacation for 2 mouths so there is no doctor that can check me urgently, I went yesterday for severe symptoms but there was nobody to check me and was told to leave. 

Before I started the pill I had extreme anxiety, health problem that still needs testing to find out what it is, very slow process becouse everyone is on vacation.

I knew very well that it's a bad time to start them again but I did it anyway. First 4 days no problem I even felt less anxiety and more happy, maybe placebo but day 5 crushed me with extreme vertigo, anxiety, restless feet and jittery.
 
Overall it crushed me yesterday, I was hardly functioning. Thank God I have to go to work today to keep my mind away from myself. 

I'm shocked that in the ER there was no neurologist to check me there was only a cardiologist. I know my heart is healthy so the only thing he could have done for me is together to laugh at my blood pressure from the panic attack I had lol.

In moments like this you know the people who got your back and care about you, thanks to all the people who understand how debilitating anxiety and panic disorder can be.

Can't believe I had the panic attack shake me, 8 years ago when I had therapy for it it was never a problem after that but this time it got me good I knew I had a panic attack but I was unable to lower how severe it was, I was not scared of it since I know what's happening but I felt hopeless unable to stop it, it's like the pill was feeding it power and no matter that I'm not afraid of it or it's symptoms it kept being more and more intensive. Playing mind games how I want it do to do it's worst didn't work (it instantly stops them for me) so I had to grab ice and rub it against my body to stop it, next time I will just let it be that ice was very cold even the panic attack did not deserve that lol.

Tldr: when anxiety is off the charts, when life beats you to your knees expect that the pill will make it alot more difficult for you at first that usual, if possible start it when your calmer before it hits the fan. If it's not an option the best description I could go back and tell myself is that there is nothing that could prepare you for this for what awaits you until it starts working.

1mpqj78,Derealization?,"Hi guys. I wanted to present something I struggle with to see if any of you relate and/or have any advice about how to cope.

I've had pretty significant anxiety my whole life - it's on both sides of my family. I started having panic attacks at 15 and there's an uncomfortable symptom I experience from time to time that's difficult to express with words. I describe it as feeling not fully there - like I'm cognitively aware & coherent but not physically grounded. Other ways I may describe it are that I'm in a dream or am about to faint.

Maybe an even better analogy would be an unexpected event (such as being in a fight or getting yelled at by somebody); you know that feeling of shock/adrenaline, where things seem blurry and surreal? That's kinda like what I'm talking about, except without the shocking event. I suddenly feel un-grounded in my body.

I learned about *derealization* years ago when I started having panic attacks, and just chalked it up to that. It happened mainly when I had panic attacks, so I didn't have reason to perseverate about it as a separate phenomenon. However, it hit me like a wave recently, and I've made some self-observations to figure out why.

First of all, I'm between jobs right now and had to take my car off the road due to lack of insurance. So, I've been cooped up inside lately more than usual, sometimes not leaving the house for a few days at a time. I notice that the symptom occurs mostly when I transition from being inside or isolated - especially if I'm on the computer or something virtual - to being outside or in a public, open environment.

The other day, my mother picked me up to help her with some chores at their camp, before which I hadn't really gone anywhere for a few days. I was scrolling Facebook and checking emails just before she arrived, and once I was in the car, it hit me pretty bad. That same dreamy daze happened and it was very uncomfortable, almost triggering a panic attack. It's happened other times with similar transitions.

I'm a B.S./psych grad and am always curious about the brain, so I can't help but wonder if there's a scientific/neurobiological explanation for why the unpleasant symptom occurs during these transitions. I thought maybe it has something to do with different aspects of your nervous system being functional when being inside consuming media vs being out & active, meaning your brain has to ""catch up"" when doing the former for several days and then suddenly switching to the latter - sort of like cabin fever with an anxious twist. But that's just speculation.

1mpl2z9,Worst panic attack I've ever had,"I feel like I'll never be the same and I'm so hoping someone will read all this to maybe relate. Because I'm still so scared and feeling detached from reality. 

Woke up at 4am after going to the bathroom, I was washing my hands and all of a sudden my heart started racing. I started panicking, checked my heart rate and it was 112, next thing I know my heart is now pounding. My hands are shaking, whole body shaking, and I feel weak. My hear rate just keeps getting higher now in the 130s-140s and this was the most scared I had ever been. I tell my husband we have to go to the ER and get their a few minutes later. I'm there for about 4 hours, feeling like my body is just continuing to push out adrenaline. My heart is still racing, I can literally feel the adrenaline in my stomach and chest. I'm just sobbing. Doctors said all my results came back fine. But I am terrified! 

I've had anxiety since I was 7, but this was the worst it's ever been! We were affected by the Central TX floods a month ago, so I saw a lot of grim, doomsday type stuff. Maybe that's why? I have been incredibly stressed. But I have really bad health anxiety and I feel so detached. I'm scared to go to sleep at night, like terrified. But I'm tired and can't keep my eyes open. I keep thinking of different things wrong with me. Please has anyone felt this? 

TLDR. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, heart racing and pounding out of no where. Went to the ER and they said I'm okay but I'm still terrified and feel like I'm the only one that's had a panic attack like this ",1755129862.0,2,14,Anxiety,anxiety

1mppgdr,imposter syndrome anxiety,"I experience intense waves of anxiety around specific things related to my profession/work. Primarily when I need to provide my assessment or critique of someone else's work. I'm a scientist and this started when I was in grad school. I started grad school with low self-esteem and one of my advisors was really hard on me, personally and professionally, and it further cratered my self-esteem and I developed anxiety, which amplified for as long as I worked under him. I assume it's probably considered some form of imposter syndrome and it has improved quite a bit since I left academia (I work in industry now). But I still do research and it still hits hard, really hard at times, when I have to explain why I disagree with an argument or interpretation of data.   
  
I also really struggle when someone questions my disagreement or critique; my body spirals into anxiety as I immediate panic that maybe I don't know what I'm talking about and they're judging me to be an idiot (which is absolutely stupid - I'm in science, *we all question everything important and it can make the work better*). Not always but sometimes I will actually have an anxiety attack level escalation in response. I've managed to hide it *mostly* but sometimes, when it's most intense, I do start to panic and then I struggle to articulate what I know I know and the important points...which makes it worse because my anxiety is basically manifesting into reality my fear and panic of being seen as a fool and/or a fraud.   
  
I'm so tired of it. I've been doing science for about 20 years now and it still happens not infrequently. It happened earlier today when I had to walk someone through multiple problems I found in someone else's work and, still, many hours later, I'm sitting at home feeling twitchy and completely stressed out, heart pounding, tension headache. 

Short of changing careers, I can't avoid the situational triggers. And I really don't want to change careers anyway. I love science and, perhaps oddly, I do actually love my job despite this weird, awful anxiety it can trigger.

I appreciate any insights or even just commiseration to know I'm not alone (and not actually a professional imposter).

1mppeay,Going on a trip…,"I am going on my first real vacation. The furthest ive been from home for an overnight trip is 2.5 hours. Always knowing that I could come home if I needed to. Since my anxiety has lessened overtime I decided to go on a trip to Cuba! (From canada) I was super excited and couldn’t wait but now that the trip is less than a month away I’m in panic mode. I’ve never been to an airport, never been in an airplane and never been out of the country! Reality is starting to set in that my anxiety is still around and hasn’t just gone away.

1mpobmw,Help - using daily Ativan for ongoing panic attacks after ER panic attack last week. Created a plan to try to help myself,"Extremely stressful life events happening right now, and last week wound up at the ER after the worst/longest panic attack of my life. I'm now in that cascade of anxiety/panic attacks that follows a big episode while I wait to see a psychiatrist and I'm using the Ativan the ER gave me every day. I'm scared the psychiatrist won't prescribe enough Ativan after this so I'm trying to create a plan.

For context I have PTSD, but I haven't had a panic attack in 15 years and back then they were tied to specific triggers. I only had to Ativan once in a while back then.

My current plan. (Some of this advice was taken from reddit.)

# 1. Address the source of the panic through ongoing therapy

# 2. Steps to try to abort oncoming daily attacks

If I've noticed a scary feeling or a scary thought - what next?

**1. IF IT’S A SCARY FEELING.**

    \*Remember things that feel true aren’t necessarily true\*

It’s hard to change thoughts while in this emotional state, so let’s help the nervous system get out of fight or flight. Less about “reasoning your way out” or “responding to the thoughts” and more “convincing your body that you’re not in danger”

* Create a sense of physical safety
   * hot shower
   * hand massage
   * hot foot bath
   * coloring in a coloring book
   * watching animal cam
* box breathing
* vagus nerve stimulation
   * singing, humming, 
   * ice pack on back of neck, face
   * cuddling pet
   * Rubbing ears
   * Butterfly taps
   * progressive muscle relaxation
      * Binaural beats
* Talk to a friend / body doubling
* Affirmations to say
   * I’m a good person and where I’m at is ok. 
   * People love me and understand. I deserve kindness.
* Comfort, distractions
   * Sweets
   * Play a little fun game

**2. IF IT’S A SCARY THOUGHT**

Recognize the thought is happening

* Is this thought familiar? Is this an “oh hey it’s you” type?
* Three choices for how to deal with it.

1. Meditation method. Note it and try to let it go. Return to focus on breathing or something else.
2. Respond to it with a pre-established response or affirmation. Use thought-substitution to replace negative thinking with a memorized list of your qualities and accomplishments 
3. Get curious about it. Notice where it is in the body. Can you talk to it’s source

# 3. Prevention: build anti-anxiety muscles with daily practice

**1. GENTLE PREDICTABLE DAILY ROUTINE**

**2. PRACTICE TOOLKIT**

Using your mirror neurons is a hack to start feeling good when you don’t have any rational, logic reasons to feel good. Long story short: you want to TRAIN in smiling, laughing, relaxing, dancing. These will be your main “weapons”.

* Singing, humming
   * Funny videos, funny podcasts
      * Created curated list
* Relaxing
   * Hot shower
   * Muscle massage
   * Foot bath
   * Curled up cozy
* Laughing
* Little dances?
* Meditation combo
* Jon Kabat Zinn or healing light meditation
* Affirmations

Anyway that's what I have so far. Any thoughts or advice?",1755138701.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1mpob1c,Dealing with a lot...looking for advice...,"28F, recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer in May.

1mpj02k,"Nurse practitioner prescribed a couple medications. Seroquel, Celexa, & Xanax. Would like some positive stories","Back story - 
22F. My mental health has never been this bad before. My ocd has been making me go crazy. I cry all the time, i wake up in the mornings shaking & sweating, i only feel safe in my house, im a self employed house keeper, so i work alone which is difficult during this time, i have lost 14 pounds in two weeks, i can’t eat because every time i try, my anxiety creeps in. I can’t sleep either. At all. My mind won’t let me rest. I was 13 days late for my period. And let me tell yall, I was a fucking monster. 

I ended up making an appointment with the nurse practitioner that works in the same office as my therapist. Told her everything that’s been going on. She’s concerned mainly about my lack of sleep. 

• Seroquel 25mg for 3 nights, (short term then as needed for anxiety/sleep) 

• Celexa 10mg (daily, every morning) this is for my ocd and anxiety 

• Xanax 0.25mg (only for severe anxiety). I voiced my concerns with this one and that’s why she gave such a low dose. She said it may even give me a placebo effect because of how low it is. These are only for when I’m in a state of panic, which doesn’t happen often (rare), but she did it just in case. 

I’m more so asking about the Seroquel and Celexa. Any positive stories? 

Again, only taking Seroquel for 3 nights. 

I never wanted it to get to this point. I never wanted to rely on medication (not that i’m against it, it just makes me sad). But i’m also scared about taking the medication itself. I’ve never been on antidepressants before, so this is the first time around. 

I also haven’t told any of my friends about what’s been going on. Or how I’m getting prescribed this stuff.

1mpnq9a,An irrational fear of being called or being perceived as stupid led to a meltdown.,"I was at marching band camp today, and when we were taking a break, my friend and I were talking about something, and then he said something else  that made me feel like a fucking idiot. When we had time to talk later, I said something like, ""I know that was constructive criticism, but that still pissed me off."" Then he said, ""If you knew it was constructive criticism, why did you mention it then?"" and then I said something else and apparently the low brass section leader got pissed off and told me to stop. I screamed, ""FUUUUUCCCCKKKK!!!"" and then started crying because I felt stupid. Last school year, I was told the phtade  ""Why even mention it then?"" twice, and since I have a fear of being perceived as stupid, I tried not to make any stupid fucking words come out of my mouth; I got pissed off from hearing that fucking phrase again and felt like everyone here thought that I was stupid. I feel like I don't even wanna talk anymore because all the shit that will come out of my mouth will be perceived as stupid.



(Note: If this seems childish to you, please understand that I was emotionally abused as a 7th grader by the principal of my old school and was constantly called stupid by her; I also have a dad that puts way too much pressure on me and a brother who constantly teases me about being stupid.

1moytuz,Paroxetine changed my life,"I was diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) a few months ago and started medication right after, I take Paxera 20 mg (Turkish medication, similar to Paxil) and I logged how it has changed my life for the better:


at first paxera turned me into an emotionless zombie. it felt as if my head was turned into concrete. i didn’t feel like myself at all. but i was also fine with it because the crazy anxiety attacks i used to have before medication was much much worse than feeling numb. other than my crippling anxiety, paxera also made me realize that i had an anger management problem. normally my mom would say shit that would turn me into a raging monster but during my first few days of paxera i found myself calmly explaining why the stuff my mom was saying was pissing me off. and she understood, said she’ll keep that in mind. normally i’d start yelling lol.  

then after like 5 days of switching to full dose i started feeling like myself again. i was making jokes and stuff. everything felt more lively, minus the anxiety. 

then i started working as a receptionist at this hotel. there was some minor bullying and hazing (some days my managers would really cross the line and straight up attack me) that would normally send me into an anxiety spiral, making me question my existence and shit lol. but i took em like a champ. i was very strong. i didn’t realize this at the time but now that i’m looking back, that shit would make me weep at night. in my head of course. i couldn’t cry before and paxera hasn’t made it any easier lol

aaand fast forward to now. the immense calming effects of paxera has definitely worn off. i’m happy about this as i didn’t like that i was literally gandhi at first lol. but those first few weeks opened my eyes about how my approach towards the outside world affects how i end up feeling as well. even though it’s not as easy anymore, i’m working to keep calm under situations that would normally send me into an anxiety spiral or cause me to get really mad and do things that aren’t very proactive to the problem at hand. i’m SO happy that i started medication man. it’s not a magic pill that fixes my problems, it’s a helping hand teaching me how to fix my problems myself. exactly how i wanted it to be, i was so scared that it was gonna be a “magic pill” lol i don’t want to be dependent on anything to be a functional person


I still feel anxiety. I still have to do breathing exercises every once in a while. I still get angry, wanting to lash out and relieve my overwhelming emotions without thinking. But Paxera has taught me that there is a better way to approach these problems.

1mpn3xv,Experiencing intense mental anxiety and awareness of thoughts,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 17-year-old who experiences very high mental sensitivity and awareness. Lately, I’ve been feeling intense anxiety that lasts for hours, mostly centered around my thoughts and awareness itself. It’s like my mind notices every single thought and pattern, which can be overwhelming.

I also have moments where I focus on ideas about my existence, consciousness, or the body, and that makes me feel more anxious. I’m learning to observe these thoughts without getting stuck in them—just noticing them as a “watcher,” not as a part of myself.

I wanted to share this because I’m looking for ways to practice being the observing mind and calm my overactive awareness. If anyone has tips on mindfulness techniques or ways to stay mentally calm without obsessing over bodily sensations, I’d really appreciate it.

1mpez0a,Hi all. I’m really nervous right now about my Ativan usage and stopping abruptly even though I’ve taken it as needed.,"So I started having panic attacks randomly about two months ago, I kept coming back to the ER, then I got prescribed Ativan as needed which I took exactly as needed once every couple of days I’d take a .5mg for panic, I’d take one before doctor’s visits occasionally or else I’d panic. About 3 weeks ago ,I went in for an MRI which I couldn’t do because I would panic when they stuck me in the machine. That day I took 1mg Ativan and it didn’t help me much for the MRI. But after that I didn’t take an Ativan for about 10 days because I felt like I didn’t need to up until July 18th I took that 1mg Ativan and a day or two after I took a .5mg then for the next days I hadn’t taken an Ativan up until August 5th for a really really bad panic attack that day I took 1.5mg and since August 5th my panic attacks have gotten worse and I’ve increase my frequency in taking Ativan. Maybe a .5mg when I wake up and another near the time I go to sleep. So in summary for the past two months I’ve intermittently used benzos to stop panic attacks and since August 5th I’ve increased my intake of them, I’m fairly sure I have somewhat of a dependency on them which I’ll go through whatever withdrawal I don’t care, but I’m really really worried if I’ll have a seizure or possibly die from not using them anymore. I already skipped when I usually take them today  and feel okay just anxious about them causing a horrible health scare. Can I get some advice or some reassurance or anything?

1mpbrj8,Anxiety with change,"Hey all, I'm struggling with anxiety from change. Back at the beginning of this year, I started a new fully remote job. Thinking it was going to be great, it ended up being awful. It caused me severe anxiety from the isolation of wfh, and not feeling part of the team. I missed my old job that I was at for 3 years. I ended up on medications and eventually started feeling better.

Now, I just started another new job that is hybrid. Learning from the last time, I came into this one with caution; just starting slow and not having any sort of expectations. However, I'm finding myself struggling with anxiety again. This first week Im remote, and the isolation is awful. Due to the nature of the work, I don't believe I'm allowed to work from a public area like a coffee shop, or else I'd love to.

A few years ago I suffered severe anxiety after moving, twice. One year after another. I moved, and then anxiety would sink in. 

Another example is when my wife and I went to Europe for three weeks. I was anxious basically the entire time, especially in the countries where English isn't the native language. I felt very nervous and fearful about the unfamiliar surroundings.

I'm noticing a pattern here that I get severe anxiety from change and unfamiliarity. It makes me nervous about the rest of my life, because change and unfamiliar surroundings is part of life. Change of job, moving, vacationing somewhere new, etc.

1mpbev4,Muscle tightness on one side of body after working out,"


So I know muscle soreness is normal after working out and I used to workout so I know what that feels like. I actually stopped working out 3 years ago because of my muscle tightness.

I really love working out but after working out I get muscle soreness on the right side of my body and I don’t know why and how to fix it. I’ve been working out like 5 weeks and the pains just getting worse.

If I workout it’s like the whole of my body is extremely tight and it’s literally from neck to my toes. I don’t workout my legs but after working out my right leg is extremely tight. My fingers are tight even my toes. 

I can’t really find anything online so no idea what it is. If I’m sitting down or laying I feel discomfort and tightness but if I move or I’m moving it feels like I’ve pulled a muscle and the pain in sharper.

It’s always the right side and just no idea what to do it’s giving me so much distress. My left side feels completely normal.

Now the only two things I think it might be is maybe a back issue like disc issues or maybe anxiety I have high anxiety which does cause me to have more tight muscles. 

Any ideas what this could be can anyone relate and how is this fixable. I have gone to the doctors and physios but here in UK they’re never thorough so they’ll tried to give me some stretches and pills but don’t actually investigate it unless I have had an accident or if I go private health care.

1mpb8j5,"Too anxious to study, is this normal or am I just lazy?","Does anyone else find it almost impossible to study when anxiety from other parts of life is overwhelming? I keep wondering if I’m just undisciplined, or if this is what happens when stress takes over.

I’m a uni student with ADHD and on the path to become a doctor(fingers crossed). In high school I could procrastinate and still get top grades, but university hit me hard. Without structure, my habits caught up to me, my grades dropped, and I eventually got an ADHD diagnosis in third year. It took me so long to realize I even had ADHD because mental health is so stigmatized in my family and even when I had to get help I had to go at it alone because I know my mom wouldn't be supportive. The diagnosis helped me understand myself, but I felt like I’d already lost so much time and confidence.

The MCAT has been my biggest hurdle. It's recommended to take it the summer after second year and so I booked it even though I knew I wasn't ready since I hadn't treated my ADHD yet but the pressure from my mom made me book it anyway. I ended up doing bad as expected but I had hope I could do better the next year. Third year I did a lot better in school, as I finally had medication for ADHD and so for the summer after third year,  I planned to study in my university town where I focus better, but couldn’t get a job to stay there for the summer, so I came home. Home is stressful, my parents always fight, and my mom is going through a major financial loss. I feel guilty leaving her alone in an unhappy home and the was a major part of why I came home for the summer as well, but being here makes it so much harder to study. I began this year's studying attempt with so much more confidence and even took a diagnostic which showed me that I had a good grasp on the content even before studying but I should've realized that I need structure and I can't study for something this content heavy and practice heavy when I'm anxious about other things. Even on medication of ADHD, I can only manage small bursts of studying, and the rest of the time my head is full of worries about my family, money, and my future. This anxiety leads me to a hopelessness that tells me there's no point in anything and that I should just give up. Without motivation I get no where with my studying and end up in a shame spiral that tells me I'm not smart enough for this and that I haven't worked enough for anything and that I deserve nothing.

My test is next week, and I’m nowhere near ready. I feel stuck, ashamed, and scared I’ve ruined my chances. I want this career badly, but anxiety has made it hard to even start, and guilt makes me feel like I'm never going to be cut out for this. I've already wasted so much time on this one test and it truly has demoralized so much.

to start, i feel overly compulsive- which i never was. now i have ocd tendencies like locking the door multiple times, or needing things my way or no way, i have severe overstimulation and irritability. the overstimulation is the main part because i never experienced it but minor things will set me off. i have little to no sex drive, i don’t even want to kiss my partner because the feeling of saliva on my lips overstimulates me. i’m so so so lazy, i can sleep for 24hrs straight if i wanted to, i have zero motivation to do anything. whether it’s going to the store or even reading an email, anything that requires the least bit of effort i don’t want to do (and i wont because i simply don’t have the capacity to care.) i want to get off of zoloft to see if it’s really me or the medication doing it. my biggest fear is that it’s me all along and i wont know how to fix it.

1mpgaft,Stopping SSRIs,"Hoping to get some feedback from people with lived experiences. 

I was in citalopram (celexa) for 6 years. I noticed lately, it was giving me headaches, making me groggy/sleepy during the day and it decreased my libido significantly (especially as of late). My doctor suggested I taper off and switch to Buspirone, an anxiolytic. I gradually tapered the citalopram, for almost 2 months and started the Buspirone only after my tapering was done. 

I have been on buspirone for about 6 weeks now, and suddenly I've started to feel physical symptoms of anxiety come back (excessive rumination to the point of not being able to focus on anything else, feeling of panic in stomach for no reason all the time). I am wondering if this is a delayed SSRI discontinuation syndrome, OR if my anxiety symptoms are just coming back, which means the Buspirone may not be helping much (gives me RLS at night too, and I have trouble falling asleep). I've noticed myself relying a bit too much on alcohol to calm my panic/anxiety over the last week or so.

I am also trying to take a break from THC, which could have something to do with all of this. 

Any feedback would be good. My pharmacist recommended maybe I get on Wellbutrin.

1mpg8pv,Everyone Loves Me… So Why Do I Feel Like I Don’t Belong?,"I’m 23 and honestly struggling a lot with feelings of not truly belonging to any of my friend groups. On paper, things are great: I have amazing friends, I’ve recently moved in with one of my best friends, I just got a pay rise, and my flat is beautiful. But despite all of this, I feel miserable and I can’t figure out why.

Here’s the situation: I know a lot of different people, and I get invited to everything, but it often feels like I’m always “joining in” rather than being part of an established group. There are pre-existing friend groups from university, living situations, or just people naturally gravitating toward each other, and I feel like I’m always coming into the middle of things.

Some examples: the guys from work have a group chat I’m not part of, and a new friend group I’ve formed over the past six months has a “house chat” that I’m not in , not because they dislike me, but because the chat is specifically for people living together. I know logically that none of this is personal, but it still hits me really hard.

I’ve also left some groups or fallen out with people in the past because they weren’t very nice, and seeing their friendship solidified without me makes me feel even more like an outsider. Even when friends tell me they love me and want me around, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just “joining” rather than belonging.

I’m worried I’m overthinking and that these feelings might start to affect my friendships. I just don’t understand why I can’t feel like I truly fit in, even when everything looks fine on the surface. Why do I feel like this, and how can I stop overthinking and start feeling like I belong?

1mpfr1a,zoloft withdrawal,"hello all! i’ve been on zoloft for about 2 years or 1.5 yrs. i started on 50, then a couple months later went on 75, a couple months after that back down to 50, and decided it was doing more harm than good and i wanted to fully get off of them. i stayed on 50 for a while and then dropped down to 25 and have been on those for maybe 2-3 months. i noticed the occasional vertigo as i dropped down the first week but nothing other than that. i ran out of my 25mg and the doctor has yet to contact me back about a refill and i have been off of them for about 3 days. i’m not noticing anything crazy besides the very very slight, almost nonexistent vertigo. i have a couple questions. 1.) will i be okay health wise if i decide to not take any again. 2.) how long will the side effects last, and what are they? i dont know because ive only been on them for about 2 years and ive been on 25 for months. 3.) should i get a refill or see how i feel, will it damage me to decide i cant do withdrawal by myself and take a pill? i’m more nervous seeing all the side effects people talk about, is it a one size fits all or everyone reacts different? i really really want off but if the withdrawal gets severe is it okay to take one or will it damage anything? i’ve been meaning to set up an appointment and discuss a tapering but they haven’t gotten back to me in 3 days. thanks for the help guys ",1755117106.0,1,1,Anxiety,anxiety
1mp9g3o,DAE overthink over-dissecting conversations even when nothing wrong was said?,"I’m sure this question has been asked multiple times, but how do y’all stop overthinking/over-dissecting text conversations when no one said anything wrong?

For context, my boyfriend met a guy not long ago and they have been clicking. I’ve seen this guy twice and the vibes are great. Now, my boyfriend is moving abroad so I’m in this anxious state looking for new friends and new connections. So I’m anxious/nervous that once my boyfriend leaves, this new guy won’t want to be my friend given that he connected with my boyfriend first. 

I find myself asking my boyfriend all the time “has he texted you? Have yall spoken?”  He shows me the messages, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong/weird, but I’ll overthink and dissect every single message. This will be in my head for 2-3-4 days and it’s the only thing I can think about. Why did he say this, why this emoji, interesting that he messaged after X hours of not talking, etc etc. 

I know that I can’t control how this guy will feel towards me once my bf leaves. I also know that this guy has a life before and will have a life after.

I have severe anxiety and fear of failure and it’s absolutely ruining my life in every way shape and form. 
I have severe fear of failure, I’m in a tech related major and the job market is complete rubbish. I’m feeling like an imposter more and more every single day, I feel like the bar has been set so incredibly high now due to AI and I NEED to improve my technical skills but I’m completely frozen.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I had an interview today as well and my face started becoming very hot down to my neck and back while the rest of my body was freezing, and when the interview ended I looked down at my knees and thighs to find them all scratched up and bleeding.

This is how bad it’s gotten. My nervous system is out of whack. My head is all over the place.

- Nausea 
- Severe gagging
- Hot flashes and sweating on some body parts while others are freezing cold.

1mp37nm,i feel like I’m going insane (M17),"2 nights ago I got really anxious because I was having worse heart palpitations than usual and ended up in the hospital which made me even more anxious. All my tests (Bloods and EKG) were normal and only my heart rate was high due to being so scared. 

I signed myself out because I felt my heart rate would drop more at home and it did after a while but I’m still constantly checking myself and being scared about my heart. 

I spoke to my GP and he told me it’s most likely anxiety and that it’s a very low chance I have a heart related problem. Even with all the reassurance from doctors I’m still so anxious and I feel like I’m on my own. My Apple Watch is making me check everything constantly like ECG and heart rate and it comes back normal every time but the ECG looks different than others using the same watch.

1mp3tag,I am SO fuckin tired of people telling me not to do things I want to do.,"So I am M26 and have been living with anxiety/DPDR since I was young. While the panic attacks and DPDR episodes have been sort of up and down since I was about 17 with some weeks/months/years being better or worse than others, I’d say I have at the very least gained a much better understanding of it than I used to have. I’ve been in working in retail/customer service since I was 18 (which probably hasn’t helped much but it’s all I’m qualified to do). 

There have been a few careers over the years that I’ve at least been interested in if not full on wanted to try. But I swear every time I even mention it online even if it’s just something as simple as “I’m interested in (X) and looking for advice” and people find out I have a history of anxiety or depression, all the responses I get are negative to the point that I don’t even want to mention it anymore because people just ruin it. 

“I’m interested in becoming an EMT” “don’t do it, you won’t be able to take care of people”

“Im interested in joining the military” “why would you want to join if you’re anxious and depressed? You would just be a liability”

“Im interested in volunteering in conflict zones”
“Just send money, you would do more harm than good because of your mental state”

Like okay I get it, I have issues. Is it so hard to believe that MAYBE I might be able to overcome them and do something with my life?

1mp1ryu,Psychosomatic symptoms are grossly misunderstood and underestimated,"Possible triggers: Talking about panic attacks, health anxiety and other psychosomatic symptoms. Unsure if this fits this subreddit as it is a broad rant about mental health though anxiety also gets a few mentions, so apologies in advance!

\--

I have been dealing with repressed emotions for the past year and a half, and the amount of strange psychosomatic ailments I've had is baffling. The fact that the existence of psychosomatic pains and ailments is practically unknown of in common society is bizarre to me.

I've had headaches, stomach aches, coughing fits, gagging sensations, tightened muscles in throat and neck and back, sneezes, feber, I've had health anxiety (I thought I had severe allergies, but it turned out to all be in my head - it even 'triggered' with specific things, like soap and pillows), panic attacks, so on and so forth. Yet it seems as though the general understanding of just how many pains and ailments that you can have that are entirely founded in mental health issues is completely lacking. This, I think, causes people who might need psychological treatment for their physical-seeming pains go untreated for years if not their entire lives.

And it's not like the experts don't know. When I went to get treatment for my stiff throat muscles, my fysio therapist actually hinted at it possibly being psychological and not physical. This was over two years ago - I've since then been doing a lot of work on my psyche, and it has helped a lot more than exercise did (though that did also help, just not as much). He was right.

I think psychosomatic ailments should be better studied and more broadly spoken of by experts to the common person. Stuff like chronic fatigue and chronic pains can, for example, be symptoms of depression or anxiety. Or, well, repressed emotions. Yet people mostly just don't know, I feel.

1mp8n90,I don't know how to help a friend and I can't stop feeling anxious over it.,"I've been like this all day. Basically here is an explaination:

I have this friend, who is deeply suicidal. The thing is, he doesn't want help, doesn't care for it. And says he will kill himself. And that, there is no changing his mind.

I have even suggested medication, but he doesn't want it. He has intrusive thoughts just like me, I have OCD so I know how hard it is. And I know meds do genuienly help. But he genuienly doesn't want it.

There was a converstation we had yesterday which, I don't know if I said something wrong, or if I did something wrong. Please let me know.

All this started when I suggested antidepresants, because it does help me. He said no, and that, he didn't want his brain to be ""altered by meds"". Which. Felt really invalidating. Like genuienly. I didn't dwell on it tho. Due to his situation.

He has been saying that death is his only way out and that, there is no world he lives for long, stuff like that. The thing is, I have experienced the loss of a family and this triggers me bad.

It kind of made me snap in the moment and I asked why he isn't even considering other solutions. Like I wanted an explaination at this point. 

I also told him how much I cared and how I could not handle loss of another person after the first one, and thats was the reason why I was suggesting this.

He explained why, how much he hated everything, and more. And he has all the right to hate everything, with all that's he's been through.

I tried to do more comforting. Which, I think it fell on deaf ears. Like how I would be there for him and care. And would do anything to help, and try to keep him alive.

But he said that it would be ok and we would both be ok.

I was crying at this point, like full on bawling. Idk if what I did was wrong but I told him I wouldn't be ok if he died. I said I was barely even ok when I experienced the last loss, and even tiny details from it. And now that I'm all grown up, knowing this and not being able to prevent it would kill me. I genuienly poured my heart out. To try and show him how much I care.

Then he apologized for even befriending me in the first place while knowing that he would not live for long. But one thing he said that tipped me off was ""if you truly mean what you say"" which again, made me feel invalidated, due to how much events in my life have effected me.

I ignored it though, but now thinking back, it genuienly stings, but I also dont blame him because he is convinced that everything could easily be a simulation. He suffers from derealization aswell, so it's understandable.

After that I just told him to never say that he shouldn't have befriended me and that, he is the most amazing person I've ever met.

After that convo ended shortly. I havent been able to properly calm down and its been a day. I don't know if I said something wrong, but I also feel kinda angry and take this with the grain of salt:

I'm genuienly angry at him for telling me that someday he will kill himself. And that, he won't seek help. I don't get why he is telling me this. To make it easier on me? That makes it way harder. Knowing and not being able to help. I genuienly can't cope with this while he is alive, let alone if he dies, what would I even do with myself? I would never live with the guilt. It's like I'm put under pressure where I can't do anything to stop it. I want to help but can't, and if he won't accept help then I can't help. I can't just say I'm fine with it because I can't just be an accomplice im this progressing suicide. I genuienly feel so stuck.  

What can I even do? I don't know and I just need help badly at this point. Does anyone have any advice?",1755101337.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

1mofgjx,Bracing.  What It Is and Why It Matters,"



Hey friends,
I want to talk about something I’ve been learning that’s helped me a LOT. Bracing.  

Bracing is when your body stays tight without you even realizing it—shoulders up, jaw clenched, stomach held in, etc. For many neurodivergent people (including autistic and ADHD folks), this isn’t just about stress or anxiety. It’s something our bodies do automatically to feel “ready” for the world. The problem is if you stay braced too long, it wears you out, makes pain worse, and can mess with how you move.

What to try:
	•	Notice your shoulders. Are they up by your ears? Gently let them drop.
	•	Put your hand on your belly. Can you take a slow breath without lifting your chest?
	•	Check your jaw. Is it tight? Try resting your tongue on the roof of your mouth but keep it soft.

This isn’t about “fixing” your posture or being perfect.  It's about giving your body a break from constant tension. Small changes, practiced often, can make a big difference over time.

Have you noticed yourself bracing? What helps you release it?

1mp6pfg,Feeling like an alien,"So for context; I went to visit one of my longtime best friends out of state for 5 days. I tend to feel anxious when I’ve been around people for too long and I haven’t had my time to decompress but I figured this would be fine as she’s my best friend and she tends to fill my cup. I left on the 7th. 

I’m not sure if this is just exacerbated anxiety but I’ve felt very weird ever since the 10th and it’s gotten worse since. It feels like after drinking anxiety/disassociation but also very different, because I didn’t really drink liquor and even when I do drink too much wine it’s not nearly this intense. It became kinda difficult to even share excitement or feel genuinely happy a few days in, it felt like my nervous system was malfunctioning. 

Internally I feel detached from my body and trapped in it at the same time. I was relying on the familiarness of streets or my childhood neighborhood to ground me but everything felt really strange yesterday when I got home. As if I didn’t 100% recognize my surroundings, like I was in an alternate reality somehow, something was just off. I just looked it up and it sounds like derealization? It also feels really overwhelming right now for me to talk to or be around anyone, even the people that normally ground me. I’m not suicidal but these feelings lead me to feel like it’s very hard to live in this state and it’s hard to feel like I’m ever going to return to normal. I honestly just want to shut myself in my room for days, I don’t feel like I can handle anything more. 

I know this cant be normal but I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has felt like this? It feels like there’s something deeply wrong with me and I think it’s only contributing to these feelings idk. ",1755096937.0,1,1,Anxiety,anxiety

I was very lazy throughout high school, and my grades suffered because of it, it wasn't until the second semester of my Junior year until I started really caring about school. My obsession over looking at college stats and comparing myself to successful people in fields I'm interested in (business, law, and politics) has taken over my life.

I've lost hours of time looking up researching every single person I see in a Financial Times or Bloomberg video or podcast to see where they went to college. I've researched tens of politicians seeing where they went. I've spent hours and hours just looking up average GPAs and SATs and being on LinkedIn looking for everyone's college.

1mp5s5d,I ruined the only girl who ever loved me…now I’m terrified to love anyone else,"Two years ago (2023), I (19M) moved to Toronto for uni.
That’s when I became the villain in my own story.

Before I left, I had this girl. She was a year younger — still in high school while I was starting uni. She gave me her whole heart, trusted me, showed me to her parents, and loved me in a way I’ll never get again.

I loved her too. But I was terrified.
Terrified of doing long distance.
Terrified she’d hook up with other guys while when she goes to uni while 
I sat in my dorm miserable. Plus I had only 1 year of dorms, while she had 4. 

So my brain came up with the dumbest “solution” ever:
If she ever does it… I’ll do it first. We’ll be even.

Petty. Insecure. Cowardly.
And I went through with it.

The second I got to uni, I started hooking up with other girls. Part of me was scared of leaving dorms as a loser. Part of me didn’t want to be the sad ex while she was out living her best life.

Meanwhile, she was in school, crying at night, going through hell. She’d still call me saying she missed me, and I’d comfort her… while knowing what I was doing behind her back.

The more I hooked up, the shittier I felt. Eventually, the flings ended. I went back to just talking to her, pretending nothing happened. We weren’t “official,” but we acted like we were. I even got jealous over other guys. Somehow, I went back home after 1st year and I was in a 3 month situationshop with her and broke up after she went to uni. She went to uni and treated me like absolute shit. I was w other girls but I made time to talk to her, but she never even spoke to me and had no clue what she was doing in uni. But no this trauma bond always had us coming back to each other and had me accepting this was more of karma’s play.

Fast forward: Valentine’s Day 2025. We get back together. I still keep the secret. She continued to treat me badly. I’d cry for hours,  it would ruin my social friendships, I went into heavy marjuana abuse, worst of all I took it. “This is my karma,” I told myself.

Then one day, I cracked. I told her — no details, just that I’d been with other girls.
That was it. Second chance gone.

What I did was wrong.
But I swear, I would do anything to give this girl the comfort and happiness she deserves. When I went back home a month ago, I was on my knees for her, trying to be the best man I could be one last time. She made memories with me, spent time with me, but made it clear she didn’t want a relationship w me again. At presence, I was the best to her, postive thinking, everything to be her ideal man but I was still kinda being treated weird. And I just let that walk over me in the name of “oh don’t react, it’s ur karma”. Idk why i punish myself like this and keep myself in this trauma bond.

I’m proud of her.
But I’m scared of myself.

Because my ex gave me everything… and I destroyed her home.
I made her cry so many nights.
And now I live with the fear that karma is just waiting to take away anyone I ever love again.

Call it trauma-induced behavior. Call it self-sabotage. I call it the biggest mistake of my life. st year.  Therapy is so expensive for me, I’ve called hotlines to prevent self harm, I’ve cried, I don’t ever wanna hurt anyone like this ever again, I don’t wanna live a lie again. But I need help, I need advice from someone who’s been in similar situations. How did anyone stop self sabotage, negativity, negative voices in their head, social anxiety, jealousy, insecurity, low self esteem. Man there’s sm and therapy is so fucking expensive 

TL;DR: 
I (19M) had a loving girlfriend a year younger than me before moving to uni in 2023. Out of fear she’d eventually hook up with other guys, I started hooking up with girls first to “be even.” She spent that year crying and struggling while I betrayed her. We stayed in a toxic on-and-off “trauma bond,” and when we finally got back together on Valentine’s Day 2025, I eventually confessed (without details). She left. Now I live with crushing guilt, anxiety, and self-sabotage — therapy is expensive, and I’m looking for advice on breaking the cycle of insecurity, jealousy, and low self-esteem.",1755094785.0,0,2,Anxiety,anxiety

1mp4xxg,resigned from my internship a week early due to anxiety,"a vent since i feel like such a failure. i interned at a company this summer-- I like the environment, my supervisor, my coworkers, and the work I was doing. everything was going good throughout the past 11 weeks I was there, and aside from some anxiety the first day, everything was going off without a hitch. for context, I've been on anxiety meds since I had somewhat of a mental breakdown in January 2021. I've been taking 20 mg of prozac since, but eventually weened off years later this january with doctor's approval. the past few months without the meds have been fine. i felt anxiety at times from school, starting a new job, and family stuff, but nothing I couldn't manage.

everything went to shit two weeks ago. i randomly had a panic attack after years of not having one for years, and it caused me to absolutely spiral and lose my shit. i ended up taking 4 sick days off from work (I lied that I caught an illness) simply because I couldnt do anything else than lay in bed, shake, and vomit from the anxiety. i mustered up the will to go back to work and had to take multiple antihistamines a day to keep me sedated enough to not have a panic attack in the office. i ended up leveling out my emotions after a week and felt almost back to normal. unfortunately, I actually caught a cold this past friday and it caused me to spiral yet again into a huge mess of anxiety. anyways, I forced myself to go to work Monday and Tuesday despite not sleeping for the past 48 hours from having panic attacks and vomiting. however, after yet another sleepless night, I  decided that I just can't go to work anymore. i just messaged my supervisor that I need to resign today, a week early from my end date, due to a medical emergency. i just got off the phone with him (where I was holding back tears like a loser mind you), and he was very understanding and seemed genuinely concerned about this ""medical crisis"" I was having.

i just feel so disappointed in myself that I let the anxiety win. I've been doing so good the past few years and over the course of just 10 days, I feel like I'm back at square one.

this internship offered me a job post grad a week ago, but now I feel that my random ""health crises"" totally destroyed my credibility, and I feel that they are going to rescind the offer. i will be speaking with HR later to see if there's any way I can save this situation as I would really want to work with this company. its not easy getting a job in my field right now, which makes this hurt even more. I'm sick to my stomach and furious that I couldn't even muster up to go to my last week of work and leave off on a good note. i am so exhausted with myself and this condition.",1755092820.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

It usually helps me calm down and drift off, and I only just learned why it works.

Cooler temperatures send your body a signal “it’s time to rest.” Even a small drop in skin or core temperature can prompt your brain to release more melatonin. Separately, sudden cooling of the face or neck can trigger the **dive reflex**, which slows your heart rate and helps you feel calmer.

Basically, I’ve been giving my body a cue to slow down without realising it.

1movhp9,Anxiety for my children,"Hello everyone,

I am French and need advice.

I am anxious by nature but the continuous information increases my fears which focus on my children (14 and 10 years old).  I receive a lot of posts on 
: product recalls due to bacteria such as e coli (minced meat, raw milk cheese, etc.) having caused dramatic situations among children - I no longer want them to consume it, which causes tension with my husband and misunderstandings by my family and friends with whom we eat
- the rise in diseases brought by mosquitoes such as chikungunya and dengue fever in France: I use mosquito repellent with a children's message, disinfect all bites with alcohol, avoid going out sooner or later. Yesterday our best friends welcomed a friend from Brazil to their home. I'm already thinking about avoiding going to their house for several weeks in case they have been bitten...

I am tired of finding avoidance strategies to avoid these risks and having to convince my husband, now that I am aware of it, how to get my children to take it. I'm afraid my children will be fearful (so far they aren't).

I should point out that I had a very complex birth the 2nd time, I was very afraid of losing her.

Thank you for listening and for your advice. If anyone is like me, don't hesitate to testify. I'm tired.

They're incredibly supportive and know about my anxiety issues but theyd not seen me shut down like that before and I can tell it bothered them. I'm not sure how to explain to them that sometimes it just happens and I don't feel like I can control it and also assure them that it's 100% nothing they've done that caused it.

The whole situation has me stressed because, while I'm generally better currently, my anxiety issues and how I managed them previously have been major contributiong factors to problems in past relationships and friendships.

I’ve felt like i’ve been faking it my entire life tbh because ill cry myself to sleep but wake up feeling fine the next morning and assume i just made it up, i’ve tried to ask my mom for help again but my throat closes up and i cant talk about it because i feel like its all in my head and that im not ‘unwell’ enough for help (her dismissiveness never helped).

Earlier this year my brothers mental health took a turn for the worst and my mom was on getting him help asap and now that hes medicated i can tell shes burnt out/ doesnt want to deal with any more mental health issues so everytime I’ve brought/ tried to bring something up she just takes it as an insult to her parenting.

1morlxm,Am I incompetent because of anxiety or does being incompetent make me anxious," I am 20f. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't think I'll ever find the solution and maybe I am just doomed to this life. For some context I have always felt like maybe I am a dumb person, too dumb to exist in society and do normal human things. I did fine in school but I struggled badly with math, I still cant add two digit numbers unless they end in 5 or 0. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING makes me nervous. The most simplest of tasks send me into an eventual breakdown. 

Whenever I'm faced with a problem or a set of instructions my mind goes blank. I overthink things to the point where it all just becomes complete mush. This happens especially in conversation, I often find that I genuinely don't know what to say or how to respond. I know it's not a social problem because it happens around family that I am very comfortable with. It's like there's nothing in my brain. Today I was driving and I made a really stupid mistake on the road because I was in a detour lane and I needed to get out with an impatient person behind me and almost hit someone. Complete absentmindedness. Definitely going to be a nice addition to the long list of things I ruminate on. There are little instances like this that happen that genuinely reinforce the notion that I might actually be stupid, and that is probably why I have anxiety, because I cant process things fast or efficiently enough as a normal person would. I never asked a psych for any learning disability or IQ testing because I am terrified of what I might learn. I worry day and night about the possibility of me being mentally incapacitated somehow and it has been destroying the little self esteem that I have. College has been tough. My psychiatrist suspects inattentive ADHD but I doubt it. ( apologies if this piece is irrelevant to sub) Not only am I anxious about the possibility of myself being doomed by low intelligence, but I also worry constantly that I might not be able to build the life I want for myself. I want to get over my anxiety and start doing things that will set me up for a good future but it's hard to see the point in that if I'm fundamentally just not built to live in society.

1moxsp1,Health anxiety,"Hello.. I don't know if this is anxiety or what. The thing I feel the most is a neverending thought about dying because of illness (even though I am perfectly healthy, I know), which makes it hard for me to sleep. The thing I'm scared the most is ""what if this is some kind of manifestation if I keep think of this?"".

I tried several methods to sleep, but none worked. Every night, I repeatedly try to focus on sleeping, but these negative thoughts reappear without my notice. And then my heart rates go higher, I feel my throat full of mucus or something, sometimes I have a little vertigo and stomachache. It feels super uncomfortable.

I have a habit of always putting my phone away, turning off the lamp, and closing my eyes at 12 am. But then I stay awake until 3 or even 4 am because of these thoughts. Normally, I manage to stay asleep for 7 hours (even tho I woke up so tired). But for the last few days, I have only been able to sleep for 3 or 4 hours.

And these negative thoughts not only appear at night, but also during the day. It bothers me so much and makes me worry all day long. I haven't seen a psychologist at all, but do I need to? Can it stop? Or does anybody know how to stop it?

Something even more concerning is the songs I hear in my head on repeat. It’s usually the last song I listened to. This started 3 1/2 weeks ago and it hasn’t stopped since. It’s debilitating, and I really have to focus to get it to stop. I remember it so clearly because it’s never happened to me before, and it was the scariest thing. Now I’m kind of just dealing with it but it gets more exhausting every day. 

I feel like I’m constantly in a trance state, and the heavy 24/7 dissociation doesn’t help either. I’m seeing things in the corner of my eye, feel like my personality is changing, struggling to find the words I want to use, forgetting things, it’s just terrifying to me. I have vivid dreams, and I get a lot of visual snow (seeing pixels, tiny flashing dots, etc.)

This all started a few months ago when I got really bad health anxiety. It sent me into a full on dissociative state again, and everything I was feeling (physical, mental) was exacerbated 1000%. This makes it so hard for me to enjoy reality and stay in the present moment. 

Writing like this has made me cry before, but now I’m kind of just tired of being like this. It’s so mentally exhausting and draining because I deal with it 24/7—from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. I guess I just feel like I’m numb to my emotions at the moment and I’m going through the motions. 



Just wanted to know if anyone has gone through something similar before, or if anyone has advice. I’m going for an MRI soon for TMJ related reasons (it’s affecting my whole body), and I have some blood work to do. Also, I have a better help therapist at the moment but he’s not really helping, just telling me about grounding and breathing techniques (which I’ve all tired before trust me).

1motxpa,Prozac racing intrusive thoughts,"

Hey everyone, I’m officially 3 weeks into taking Prozac 20mg, and since about day 10, I’ve been having really weird, illogical thoughts that don’t make sense but cause a lot of anxiety and overwhelm me and feel logical at the moment.

It’s scary because these thoughts feel so intrusive and make me panic over things that don’t even seem real or logical.

Is anyone else experiencing this? How did you cope with it? Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!

1mo3jhn,Shout out to everyone with anxiety right now,"Shout-out to everyone battling anxiety right now.

It sucks. Big time. And I’m sorry you’re in it.

But here’s the thing — you’re still amazing exactly as you are. Anxiety doesn’t make you broken, weak, or less worthy of joy. You deserve a good life, same as anyone else.

One foot in front of the other. Talk to someone — mate, family, co-worker, therapist. Talking helps.

Move your body, eat decent food, sleep when you can. For me, sorting my physical health was the first domino in getting better.

If outside crap is fuelling your anxiety, be brave enough to make the changes you need.

Anxiety fucking sucks. It’s hard. But you can do hard things.

1monli3,Husband's Voice Issues Returning with Anxiety/Stress - Desperate for Suggestions,"Hi everyone, I'm reaching out because my husband is struggling with a distressing speech issue, and I'm feeling pretty desperate for advice. A few years ago, he had severe anxiety that caused his voice to sound extremely strained—like he was choking or couldn't breathe—whenever he spoke. It was really embarrassing for him, especially in professional or social settings. Back then, he tried meditation, got Botox injections in his vocal cords (which helped a lot), and was on sertraline. Over time, he relied on sertraline alone, and things improved enough that he stopped it about a year ago. He was doing okay until recently.

In the past couple of weeks, his voice has started going in and out again, sounding strained and effortful, especially when he's stressed (e.g., thinking about student loans, talking to authority figures, or feeling panicky). He's also recently reconnected with family members, which seems to trigger it more (it was less frequent when he wasn’t in contact with them). I think the stress is overwhelming him, and without meds or Botox, he’s stuck in a vicious cycle where worrying about his voice makes it worse. 

I am fairly confident this is anxiety-related, and not spasmodic dysphonia, but we haven’t seen a doctor yet for this recurrence. Has anyone dealt with something similar? Any advice on:

* Treatments that worked for you (Botox, meds, therapy, etc.)?
* Ways to manage stress/anxiety that might be triggering this? This would be ideal.
* Tips for supporting a partner through this kind of issue. 

We’re planning to see an ENT and maybe a psychiatrist soon, but ideally, he could learn tools to implement in these stressful situations as opposed to traditional medical intervention. Thanks for any insight.",1755038940.0,2,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1monith,Is There Anything That Has Helped You Calm Your Anxiety?,"Hi! I have been diagnosed with Selective Mutism (type of anxiety disorder) when I was a child. 

My question is in the title of this post and at the end of this post, but I wanted to provide some context specific to my situation as well. 

Even as a young adult, I still struggle with so many things due to it and anxiety/social anxiety in general (and some other things, I’m currently trying to go get checked out for any other diagnosis but I have been having no luck with getting an appointment with anyone to see if I have any undiagnosed things if any could also be causing me to have anxiety). 

I struggle with doing anything that is unfamiliar with me. I freeze up, my mind shuts down, my memory fogs up, I can’t think or function, and I begin to freeze up. Also, I feel very paranoid. No matter how small or silly it is, I get like this. I am terrified of somehow embarrassing myself, making a mistake, risking getting in trouble and accidentally doing something or going somewhere where I’m not supposed to, looking silly, and looking stupid. I always feel like someone is going to pay attention or watch me and what I’m doing. I’m really afraid of being negatively judged. I’m afraid of something negatively affecting my reputation. 

Especially since I had some issues in the past where people cared about what I was doing. I was doing nothing wrong and illegal, and other people did the same things, but of course it was just me who people had to have an issue with. But still, those situations made me more afraid to do things out of the ordinary and also making me afraid and feeling paranoid when out in public. Also, I have been negatively judged in the past and also past situations negatively affect me. 

I am a very sensitive person and get upset easily. I don’t want to upset someone somehow or accidentally do something wrong, I’ll feel guilty and embarrassed if I do. Also, I’ll get upset and embarrassed and feel even more insecure if someone negatively judges me. I overthink everything. I get embarrassment over the smallest and silliest things, and I think about it and feel embarrassed about it for a long time. 

I can’t seem to do much of anything by myself. I always feel a little more comfortable having someone that I’m comfortable with me and to help me. But I also struggle to make friends. If it doesn’t work out, I feel bad. Also, I quickly get drained socializing with people who I’m not comfortable or close with. It’s hard for me to get close and comfortable with people, and I can’t get comfortable/close with many people. 

I’m a second year college student. I really want to explore campus and all of the buildings to feel more comfortable. I didn’t get to do that much last school year. However, I don’t want to accidentally go somewhere where I’m not allowed to, or for people thinking I’m weird if I’m just walking in one area, or suddenly turning around in a hallway, or trying to open a door that is locked, or being questioned to what I’m doing, and so on. 

Also, I want to be a content creator and post content on social media. However, I’m afraid of talking in public and taking pictures and videos when people are around. I also want to set up my phone to take pictures and videos of myself just for fun, even in random spots like outside around campus, or even inside if there’s not many people around and as long it’s not distracting/disturbing anyone, but I’m afraid of being judged or look at weirdly, especially since no one is taking my picture and instead it’s my phone set up. I also want to do photography, which I have did a few times, but it’s still very scary. I just don’t want any issues with anyone or to get in anyone’s way. I just want to be able to do more things out of the ordinary but also to be more normal and to be able to do things independently. 

My anxiety can get so bad to the point the fear is draining, tiring, and overwhelming. It’s too much so I can’t do what I want to do. 

I know most people don’t care and I know many other things like if someone negatively judges, that’s not my fault, it’s okay to make mistakes, everyone makes mistakes, and so on. My mind understands that but just can’t apply it to my life. 

I have went back to therapy a few weeks ago. I see my therapist for an hour once a week. I also used to see this therapist several years ago for the same or similar issues for some time. So I’m glad it’s someone who already knows me from before. My therapist told me I could possibly get prescribed anxiety medication from my doctor, but I haven’t had any luck with getting a doctor’s appointment. My doctor is on vacation then only going to be working one day a week. There’s another doctor who could probably take me but they aren’t able to take anyone until next month in September. I go back to college in less than two weeks this month, and it’s always the start of the semester that’s the most anxiety inducing. This is so frustrating because it’s so hard to get healthcare when I really need it. 

I have came on here to ask, what can help with dealing with severe anxiety and to help lessen it? Like are there things you take for your anxiety (that doesn’t require a prescription) that helps? Are there any things that you tell yourself or do that helps? Obviously please don’t recommend anything that’s harmful or illegal. Thank you!

I feel like I was at a point where I could do more and more things that previously scared me and I just felt a lot calmer during most days because I knew how to deal with symptoms and trusted myself more...

Recently though, there has been another family related issue and I had time off from work (planned vacation time)...and everything has stressed me out more than usual. I stayed at home most days and avoided stressful situations, thinking I would allow myself time to relax. But now, going outside totally overwhelms me again and I've felt incredibly anxious for several days in a row and even had a couple of panic attacks again which I haven't had for a long time now.

Right now I just feel a bit discouraged and annoyed that it came back...I suppose staying inside and avoiding stressful situations has made everything worse but I sort of feel like I have to start from scratch because I just wasn't able to calm down and it's kinda getting to me. It's just hard to accept this feeling now that I've been okay for a while.  
I guess slowly confronting myself with a few challenging situations again might help but I'm really frustrated with myself and daily life got a lot more exhausting again...plus it sort of surprised me and I feel like I don't fully understand why it's this intense again even tho I learned to cope quite well before.

This friend's friends started interacting with me, and this led to an unhealthy friendship, where there were always stupid jokes and stupid comments. Many of these jokes were about dicks, sex, shit and other things, and this affected my style of socializing on the internet, every server I joined I made these comments.

At the beginning of my 17th birthday I ended up joining a discord server where I ended up becoming friends with people, even with some jokes and strangers from me, we were still friends and each person responded flirtatiously. In short: one accepted being made fun of and made fun of it back, the jokes weren't harsh... at least most of the time.
However, the problem was that people over the age of 13 could enter this server, and I still made these strange jokes and comments.
The jokes and comments were not serious at all, but they were still wrong even though they were ironic.
When I was 18 I mellowed out, but I still had these comments and jokes.

Nowadays, after leaving that server, I finally realize how wrong and stupid I was. I can't forgive myself, I went back to the server to apologize to some people who were once my friends, they said everything was fine and they didn't mind, but I feel like it's not OK!
I was stupid, why did I do this and only realize it was wrong now?

1morrqk,Saw a psychiatrist today and I was left lost about meds,"Hey everyone, so this may be a little long but I really need some advice and grounding. 

So for context, I've been with my therapist for 5 years. She has diagnosed me with anxiety, depression, ptsd, and adhd. She has told me in the past that I'd probably benefit from medication. Well last week, I told her I have my appointment with my psychiatrist and she told me she was happy and to be upfront and tell them all I've been feeling and that I don't want to just be out on a slurry of meds. So I asked her, what symptoms should I make sjre to bring up? She said to bring up my anxiety, hypervigilance, rage/anger, lack of motivation, difficulty starting tasks and staying on task. 

So, fast forward to today and my psychiatrist was really nice and listened to all I had to say (she was a resident and had the attending MD in the room to observe, both were nice). After speaking to me for about 45 mins, they decided on my game plan which is Lexapro 5mg take 1/2 tablet daily for 2 weeks and if side effects are going well, go up to 1 tablet daily. Clonazepam 5mg for panic attacks (only 5 pills), and reconvene in 8 weeks and see how its going at which point they want to consider Vyvanse. 

So, I have PCOS which is having horrible flareups one of which is high androgen symptoms so I am on Spironolactone 50mg daily to bring me to a lower level and hopefully reduce symptoms. (This is key to what is now having me confused).

I leave my appointment and call my fiance (together 11 years, we have a 5 year old son) and I tell him my gameplay and he questions me ""babe what do you mean you have anxiety? I get anxiety like everyone does why do you need meds like what are you feeling"" and I tried to explain and he said the same thing again and said it sounds normal. I told him that I just feel anxious alot of the time and especially at night for fear that I'll die in my sleep. Which he said a lot of people feel that way. So then it got me to overthinking and I'm questioning if I even need to be on meds or if I'm just making things sound a certain way that they think I need meds? I decided to reach out for possible meds because I just have had this rage and anger that I've never had before (which my fiance said ""oh so like high testosterone levels can cause which your taking something for already"") and im overstimulated and irritated all the time. Even while writing this my son is just trying to talk to me and show me something and after saying give me a second a couple times I'm just irritated which I feel like my fuse wasn't this short before. My son has adhd symptoms and is very hyperactive and impulsive so we clash a lot and hes overstimulated and so am I so I cant help him regulate if I'm no. Hence why I wss interested in something for adhd. 

Both my therapist and psychiatrist went straight to anxiety medications so im not sure if anything what I've said here sounds like anxiety and if I should even be on meds? I'd appreciate any thoughts/advice because as I said now I'm just confused. I'm left thinking, ""do I even need meds?"" ""Do I even experience anxiety?"" ""Maybe I'm painting a portrait of a person that isn't truly me?"" ""My fiance would know better since he's with me all the time, so maybe I'm fine?"" 

I'm just lost. My anxiety isn't as bad as when I was a teen but I have had panic attacks, I think when my anxiety is bad its just bad which maybe in their eyes warrants meds. I feel like my main struggle right now is lack of motivation, I know I have to get things done I just don't start them and I let it pile up, overstimulation and just plain irritation and anger I feel.",1755050069.0,1,10,Anxiety,anxiety

I’ve been on countless SSRIS, including fluoxetine, duloxetine, citalopram, sertraline, mitazapine and a few I can’t remember. Non of them worked, literally none of them. I have them all a chance to get into my system, taking them for 3-6 months. So why in hell are the doctors keep pushing me on to a different kind… they all use similar mechanisms of action.

I recently came across a benzodiazepine, but not your average benzodiazepine. Tofisopam is a 2,3 benzodiazepine where as the mainstream ones are 1,4 benzodiazepine.

Tofisopam is believed to be less addictive and some reports say it has no withdrawals. Sounds like a wonder drug! Even SSRIs have withdrawals, and just make you feel disgusting. Never will I take a SSRI/SNRI again. They just do not work for my brain.

So I’m going to put it to my GP at my next appointment to see if he can try me with Tofisopam. The only hindering problem is that I have a record of self medicating benzos so that might be a hurdle to overcome when trying to get prescribed this. I never abused benzos, I took them as if they had been prescribed. They are the only thing that helps with my anxiety.

1moqxwm,Please Help. Can't tell if these symptoms are of a panic disorder/anxiety,"Hi. F29 (going on 30 here shortly) and have never experienced anything as severe as this.

Recently I've been stressed out about back pain (alongside something else that has to do with health). So in my fear I went to urgent care to try and curb my concerns or at least get help if it was something serious. Doctor seemed to think it was due to stress and sent me on my well prescribing Baclofen.

The next day I took a nap in the middle of the day and woke up from the dead of sleep experiencing: Overall sense of dread, A hot flash washing over my body, as well as nausea. These were new ""symptoms(?)"" I guess you could say. I went to the ER. They did the general check up, said the pain in my shoulder was from muscle, took my blood as well as urine sample. Everything came out okay. They sent me home.

It's been a handful of days since then and I'm not experiencing as intense of hot flashes (possibly because I was taking baclofen and they may have been a factor, though it hasn't been long enough to say if they'll continue) but have woken up with now diarrhea and heartburn.

This all followed up to a point later today (I was getting worked up and frustrated due to nausea still persisting), I had to pull over and dry heave. I'm not sure what to do at this point, am anxious. I have an appointment set up with my primary care doctor, but am having major health anxiety that it's something worse.",1755047755.0,1,3,Anxiety,anxiety
1moq4dn,Working with giants,"This summer, I was invited to participate in a small group exhibit at a state museum. I was given a brief, a theme, and date ranges, and I quickly accepted. It’s a state Museum after all those opportunities don’t come along every day. Fast-forward to this week: I found out who the other artists in the group will be via the marketing materials. 

It turns out the other two are wildly successful, highly educated artists with multiple art degrees, Ivy League backgrounds, dozens of speaking engagements, and well established careers. In contrast, I have zero formal art education, I’m almost entirely self-taught. The only art education I have is a C grade in a community college painting class in two online courses. I sort of learned what I know by trial and error. But I have been working in the same medium since before the pandemic so in a way, I learned this small little niche in which we all find ourselves in.

Part of me feels incredibly lucky to be considered alongside these giants of our medium. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel a bit insecure. Why was I chosen when I don’t fit their mold?

I’m working on my pieces for the show, but I keep second-guessing myself at every step. Honestly, I’m more worried about what they will think of my work than what the public will. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you get past it?

I guess this is a form of imposter syndrome. On one hand, I feel deeply grateful to be invited. On the other, being in the same space as “high art” makes me feel like I don’t belong. like I might be setting myself up for failure or risk being perceived as a charity invite.

1mo5nzi,A shift that’s helped me handle anxiety in a big way,"I’ve had anxiety for years — constant thoughts, overthinking, replaying conversations. Even when I was fine on the outside, my mind was always running inside.

Recently I started doing something different: I put all my attention on everything around me. Not just one object or a few details — literally the whole scene. I look around and take in as much as I can at once: people moving, cars passing, colors, sounds, the way the air feels, everything happening in my surroundings.

When I fill my focus with the outside world like that, there’s no space left for the anxious inner voice. It’s quiet. And the more I practice it, the faster I can snap into it — even in moments that used to set me off.

It doesn’t solve every problem, but it’s completely changed my baseline. For the first time in years, I feel calm just being here in the moment.

I was recently prescribed .25 mg of Xanax to take up to two times daily to help me with the severe anxiety. I’m also going on an overseas vacation this week, which really triggers the anxiety and panic.

1moi1e8,Having nightmares about taking my College Algebra class this upcoming semester....,"Sounds so stupid to read that title... but my anxiety is mainly stemmed from the fear of the unknown. 

All I have to go off of, is how I've always been bad at math (taking the easy versions of each math course in HS and still getting D's and C's...) and have never taken a college math course at an actual university. My first college math course, I *just* took at a community college this summer (intermediate algebra). It was an ""at your own pace"" online course - which really helped so I could go back in the videos or pause to write notes/think things through more whenever needed. I got an A- and the professor didn't have me take the final.

At first, that all made me feel super confident for this College Algebra course... but it'll be so different. My professor for this course is known to have a thick accent - which is fine of course - but I have auditory processing issues, and thick accents take me a while to understand. Which can make note taking/keeping up hard for me.  
It's also a *COLLEGE* algebra course, which will be the hardest math class I've ever taken. First math class where I've had to genuinely use a graphing calculator (used one a bit in HS, but I remember how bad I was at it...)

I'll also be taking this course ontop of 4 other classes, 2 of those classes are focused on my degree - so classes that are super new to me. *When I took my community college course, it was on its own - so extra time to study and such.* I won't get all that extra time with a full 16 credit course load :/

  
I also eventually have to take a stats class - which I've never taken before. My bf is prepping for a stats class and I looked at his book and tbh it just made my anxiety much worse.... because *huh??*



It probably doesn't help that, with my degree, any classes in my degree field I need a B- or better, and any core classes like maths and sciences I need a C- or better..... but my past with low D grades in math is making me panicky.

  
Idk I'm just so nervous. I've had 3 nights of nightmares about failing this course in a row. No nightmares about failing the courses for my actual degree though...ha",1755026136.0,2,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1monl8m,"I’m scared to start an SSRI, but after years of trying everything it’s my last hope","I tried everything. Every diet, supplement, workout routine, therapy, self help method etc… Some helped for a bit but never enough. The closest I got was medicating my adhd with Vyvanse but I couldn’t handle the crash everyday.

I am not at all anymore where I was in my journey two years ago when I still had many panic attacks, I can’t even remember anymore when my last panic attack was. However, I have been chronically fatigued and so unbelievably tired because I’m just housebound with moderate 24/7 levels of anxiety unable to leave the house without completely dissociating. I have DPDR everywhere I go and my anxiety is so exhausting that I’m just so tired everyday. I haven’t been able to function for over a year now and I am stuck in trying to find a solution to all this at all times. No matter the amount of therapy, or types of therapy, I just can’t seem to logically think my way out of it.

I think SSRI’s could benefit me, but as someone with health anxiety, they scare me to death. It’s not even so much the side effects, it’s more so that I’m scared to lose myself. I’m also really scared about it changing me forever even when at some point stopping the medication. Like it making me worse than I am now if I ever come off of them permanently. I read a lot of stories about how SSRI’s ruined peoples lives and that terrifies me. I know I shouldn’t do this but these drugs are pretty heavy, and I’m just scared that this decision will destroy my life. The reason this is really amplified is because my whole life crashed down and this whole anxiety, panic and depression journey all started after my first time of taking xtc, so that one pill ruined my life for nearly 3 years now, I’m scared it’s gonna get even worse.

TLDR; I’m scared to lose myself, my drive, my passion and my creativity. I’m also scared about permanent damage all from taking SSRI’s.",1755038922.0,1,3,Anxiety,anxiety

Building a routine with consistent sleep or short walks also makes a difference over time, as it gives your mind a break from the constant worry cycle. If you’re looking for a low-key way to process those thoughts privately, I’d recommend something like VoidTalk AI—it’s a place to get things off your chest where no one will see it, dropping simple prompts to navigate feelings and problems without the pressure.

1mnzvig,Horrible Reaction to Buspar! It seems like no one has had this experience.,"Hi everyone. I recently switched to a different psychiatrist since they are closer to where I live. My previous provider was prescribing 8 pills per month of 1mg lorazepam for anxiety & irritability related to my PMDD. This was life changing for me in a good way. I assumed my next provider would continue with care, since it’s a low amount, safe, and effective. I’ve tried about 4 other medications (along with coping mechanisms) that did not work out before I landed on lorazepam, which gives me no side effects. Instead, my new provider insisted on cutting out the lorazepam altogether because benzos=bad because of dependence & addiction and started me on Buspar 15mg twice a day EVERY DAY. I asked if I could take it as needed since I don’t want to deal with an unnecessary dependence, but they said it has to be taken every day in order for it to work. 


Well, the first day I take it, I take half of one just in case, since I tend to be sensitive to medication. When it kicked in, I began to feel clammy, dizzy, nauseated, and heard ringing in my ears upon standing. At first I thought no biggie, I just need to lay down and wait for it to settle in, NOPE. Soon enough, my blood pressure was too low for me to stand and I felt like I was breathing on manual mode for too long. After 45 mins., I fell asleep and woke up gasping for air like I’d just stopped breathing in my sleep! I had my partner make me some extra strong coffee in hopes that my blood pressure might become more stable since I used my BP cuff and it read 88/60. About an hour or so after that I began to feel better, but I told my provider at my next appointment and she said that’s “never happened to any of her clients before” and that it didn’t make sense. I know I’m not crazy and I wasn’t having a panic attack, I had taken it to help calm my PMDD-related rage. How is this medication safer than lorazepam?

I’m thinking of starting a diary, so that my thoughts are something I can literally look at.

1mojuzq,Cardiophobia,"Hello, Reddit! I wanted some guidance on a situation that some of you might be familiar with. Just for a quick backstory, I have been going to a high intensity spin class about four times a week for the past two years. I have had no issues going and would frequently like to push myself and put my heart rate in zone five for maximum “fat loss “. 

In January, I had an incident after my spin class where my heart rate spiked after class going all the way up to 210 while just sitting down. I think it might have been a mixture of anxiety that caused it to rise so much, I also had taken two puffs of my inhaler that morning, which I think is what caused the spike. I ended up being able to go back to spin after that and had no issues until about two months ago. I would be done with my class and it felt like my heart rate wouldn’t go down as fast as it normally had in the past two years. I also would get feelings of lightheadedness, especially when doing the stretches afterwards. Since then I feel like my life has been turned upside down, I have been unable to tolerate most cardio. I have feelings of lightheadedness a lot throughout the day, especially when standing up after lying down or squatting. I have been checked out by my doctors with an ECG and also a 24 hour halter who just say that it might be stress/anxiety. It has completely ruined me and I don’t know how to get back into it (I know most people will say to just do it, but when you feel like you are actively dying when doing any sort of cardio, it’s hard to just push yourself to do it.) 

I wanted to see if there is anyone experiencing anything similar or how they overcame this situation. I feel like I used to have such an amazing routine and loved doing my morning cardio and now all I feel is jittery, anxious, and lightheaded all day with no real answers.

Upon mounting pressure thought it was finally time to get help. The doctor prescribed me 50mg sertraline. I have been taking it since last Friday. Part of my anxiety is stressing around sleep, if don't get enough think something bad will happen and if anything disrupts my routine feel super stressed. The main side effect I'm getting is I'm not sleeping. take it first thing in the morning yet still cant sleep. I dont know whether it's the sertraline or the fact know it effects sleep so l'm convincing myself each night that it's going to be a rough night so then I'm restless. know it's still early days but I'm just worried. I do go and lay on the sofa if I can't sleep and seem to go to sleep relatively quickly on there. Any advice that would be great.",1755030147.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1modiqn,Breathlessness/small panic attacks daily HELP,"New poster, sufferer of GAD, OCD, Chronic Depression, Panic Disorder. 37 years old.

Long story short, I developed recurring panic attacks while I was incapacitated for 18 months waiting for back surgery. I've always had severe anxiety and OCD but perhaps the combo of chronic severe pain, opioids and being bed ridden tipped things over the edge. 

The full blown panic attacks have mostly subsided but I'm left with the episodes of feeling like I can't breathe properly daily which means I've not been able to discontinue benzos for almost 2 years now. On average I take 15mg a day Oxazepam,on top of Pristiq, Agomelatine, Quetiapine and propopronol. 

The best way I can describe it is feeling like I have a THICK elastic band around my chest and the only thing that relieves it and allows me to get a full breath and fall back into effortless, normal breathing is oxazepam. 

But of course, it's not meant to be taken daily or for long periods so I'm constantly stressed and terrified about what will happen if they stop prescribing it. 

Has anyone else had similar symptoms and found a medication/treatment that relieved it? I know it's possibly a combo of panic disorder and the ocd making me fixate on my breathing.",1755016276.0,2,0,Anxiety,anxiety

Just wanted to vent out something n get some advice! I am a first year PhD student n in a very good understanding lab with extremely considerate lab members. 
I enjoyed coming to the lab n doing my experiments everything until March when I ended up falling for a colleague.. i confessed my feelings to him n he was happy with it. But after a few days I made a bad mistake, I purely told him as a joke n also to test the waters that “I wish I had a boy of my culture as my bf” and he was extremely offended. For 2 months I tried to convince him that I like him n I was loyal but he still told me to move on n find someone from my culture n that nothing can happen because we work in the same lab. It’s been months n I am exhausted from everything. My enthusiasm for my PhD has reduced considerably, I am forced to see him every single day as we work in the same lab.. which is making it extremely difficult for me to move on..nothing is going fine for me now.. I am just so done with it now.. my colleagues support n understand me always but ofc it’s unfair to them also as they have so much on their plate… i see my crush talking to everyone else, having lunch in a vvv good mood and sharing friendly banters but with me it’s overtly formal, direct n short conversations… everything is taking a huge toll on my mental health now..

I'm planning a wedding and work a very stressful job, so that doesn't help. He said that I could have an MRI, which I got. The report said nothing about MS, just lesions from possible headache issues. He said there was one spot he would monitor, but it was not MS at this time.
I also have scoliosis and back issues, which also cause burning and tingling in my legs and arms. I sound like a serious mess, but I exercise every single day. My blood work was also fine, with slightly elevated B6 levels.

Years ago I was taking a cbd capsule product that I thought changed my life for good. It completely relieved  all my anxiety and made me feel like I used to be. 

It got banned from being imported to my country which was devastating.

I went on to buy heaps of different cbd products from others and none of them helped me like this product I was buying. 

I did some research to find it was CBD mixed with GABA. 

I went into a deep dive and found the great brand “Thorne” makes a natural form of it in capsules. 

I started taking them daily and within a few days I was a new person. Absolutely life changing!!

There’s a lot of new research coming out about gaba and its effects.

There is a lot of old research done claiming it doesn’t actually work which has been debunked and also thousands of people loving the effects it’s having on their anxiety and sleep quality.

Check it out and report back!!!

I already signed and sent all the forms yesterday evening, but the contract isn’t 100% finalized yet because the store manager is on vacation.

My mom suggested we go today to buy work clothes, because I’m a part-time on-call hire and might start sooner than expected, possibly before I’d have time to shop later.

At the store, the staff member told me the discount only works once everything is officially processed in the system. She even called the manager (who’s on vacation) to check, but the manager said no, not yet. Later, the staff member mentioned the manager wasn’t thrilled about being called during vacation.

I apologized several times for the trouble, explained I didn’t want to cause any fuss, and thanked her for her help. She reserved the clothes for three days for me and said she’ll let me know if the discount can be applied sooner. I told her that if not, I’ll just come back Friday and buy the essentials without the discount.

They've taken care of me so dearly  that a very scary life has been manageable for years but reality is sinking in and catching up that eventually I'll have to learn to do this on my own and I don't know how or where to start and the thought has given me such grave amounts of stress and despair that I'm puking and nearly bedridden for the past week even though none of what I'm afraid of has happened yet.

I do my breathing exercises, I do the 5-4-3-2-1 thing, I focus on mindfulness for hours to pull myself out of a funk for 5 minutes and then I trigger myself and spiral again in short order. Every time I go to sleep I hope I don't have to wake back up because the pressure it so intense and thinking about dealing with that pressure on top of not having my parents to speak to in the future about it makes me hysterical.

And on top of that I keep thinking to myself ""don't let your last years be full of fear and unnecessary grief"" and I fight these negative thoughts tooth and nail but they won't leave me the fuck alone and it's driving me insane.

It's going to happen, it's inevitable that this grief is part of my future, and the thought of that is growing on the back of my mind like a tumor I can't remove.

Then I read a paper about how simple vibrations can be used to stimulate nerves, and I thought—why not try it? I used my phone’s vibration against the side of my neck, just under the jaw where the vagus nerve runs. Almost immediately, I felt more awake, like my mind had been switched on. Over time, I started to notice something even more important—my anxiety was loosening its grip. 

It’s such a small, low-tech thing, but for me, it’s made a huge difference. I now use a little app I made called VagusVibe to control the vibrations better, but honestly any vibration app that can give smooth vibrations will help, the most important part is just knowing there might be simple, unexpected tools out there that can help.

I assumed that after getting the scan done it would just go away, but it’s been another week and it hasn’t. it’s honestly making me anxious again because it doesn’t seem normal to constantly have a headache.

sometimes when i’m super distracted it goes away (like during pilates today) but like 99% of the time it’s there, even if i’m busy. and when it gets better i think it’s going away but then it comes back in full force. 

i’ve also already tried peppermint oil, going to a chiropractor, getting a massage, calming tf down

does anyone else get this like is this normal? what can i do about it? any tips would be appreciated!",1755015292.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1mo4spb,I can’t stop obsessing over a missed chance to talk to someone,"On Saturday, I took a sleeping pill (zolpidem). After two hours, I still couldn’t sleep, so I decided to walk to a nearby gas station for a drink.

There, I met a girl around my age (I’m 25). She tried to start a conversation, but I told her I didn’t want to talk. A few minutes later, I ran into her again, and once more I shut the conversation down.

Because of the zolpidem, I don’t fully remember how the conversations went — and maybe that’s what frustrates me the most. Just a few minutes later, I regretted it so much.

I’m a very closed-off person. I rarely form new connections, and I almost never talk to strangers. This was the first time in my life someone approached me like this out of the blue. Now, I keep replaying that moment in my head over and over, to the point I feel like I’m going crazy.

I know realistically it would’ve probably been just a short, casual chat — but in my mind, it’s become a huge “missed opportunity.” I’ve been thinking about it non-stop for two whole days, and it’s exhausting. My anxiety keeps triggering uncontrollable crying spells, and I don’t know how to stop.

Any advice on how to move past something like this would mean a lot.

1mod06g,Question about my anxiety medications?,"Would love if some professionals or people with experience could answer this

**Short version:**
I’ve been taking Anxetin 20 mg (Fluoxetine) for a while. Recently, a doctor (who honestly had a terrible attitude) switched me to Escitalopram 10 mg.
Is this switch okay? Or could it mess me up for the next few months?

**Long version:**
For the past few months, I’ve been going to a government hospital in my country. It’s not ideal, but it’s cheap. The downside is that I see a different doctor every month, depending on who’s on duty. They all have access to my records, and when I first started, they did full blood tests.

I told them about my anxiety, social anxiety, anxiety attacks, and constant overthinking. They prescribed Anxetin (Fluoxetine), and after about a month it started working. It didn’t make my anxiety disappear, but it made me calmer, less irritable, and less quick to anger. The only downside was that it made it harder to sleep, so they gave me a separate medication at night to help with that.

This month, I mentioned the sleep issue again, but instead of just adjusting the night meds, this doctor switched my *main* medication — the one I take in the morning — without asking many questions or listening much to me. It’s the first time any doctor has done that. He was dismissive, gave short answers, and seemed uninterested. Eventually, he told me I was wasting his time and taking time away from other patients. This really upset me (I have anxiety, after all, so his attitude didn’t help). I ended up leaving angry and later cried on the way home.

Now I’m stuck with this new prescription from a doctor I don’t trust. I’ve asked other doctors in the same hospital, checked with pharmacists, Googled, and even asked ChatGPT — and everyone says Escitalopram 10 mg is fine and might even work better than Fluoxetine if I’m patient. But switching antidepressants isn’t something I take lightly, because it can affect you for months. I’m just trying to make sure I’m not making things worse.",1755015153.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1mo77xf,My Friend Keeps Spiking My Anxiety,"Looking for some advice from you folks who understand! I’ve got a wonderful friend of many years—very supportive and thoughtful in the past, but the past couple of years, she’s really gone down a rabbit hole of depression and anxiety. 

She lives halfway across the country from me, so the last time we saw each other was years ago. We just talk on the phone these days, which used to be fun. But with her emotional issues, every call now is mostly her telling me how bad her life is. I deeply sympathize with that, but there’s nothing I can do about any of it from 1500 miles away. I’ve tried to make suggestions, but that goes nowhere.

She prefers to talk in the evening, so if our call runs for a while, it’s bedtime for me—and by that time, my anxiety is so high that I can’t get to sleep for 2-3 hours. If I don’t get good sleep, my whole next day is a mess.

I really would like to ask her what she wants/expects of me. Should I tell her that she’s upsetting me? I feel like I’m the only person she wants to unload to, maybe because I just sit here and listen. I’m terrible at being honest (childhood history of being yelled at if I tried to express my feelings), and I don’t want to hurt her. But the way I see it, she’s got to take some sort of action or nothing will change, and “action” doesn’t mean making ME feel worse and worse.

Suggestions and advice would be appreciated. I really don’t want to lose my friend, but our relationship right now feels like a punishment.",1755001323.0,2,1,Anxiety,anxiety

1mocilo,Is it normal to be extremely anxious about death (not dying) since childhood??,"When I was around 9 years old, I started feeling extremely anxious about being dead, or better said, not existing anymore and forgetting everything about my life and me. Since then, I've thought about death EVERY single day until today, especially at night, before going to sleep. I started feeling like this one day, and it's a bit weird because I've never had any near-death experience or a very dangerous disease. I remember that in the first weeks I started feeling scared about ceasing to exist (I was around 9-10); it got really hard to concentrate on school. I used to run in panic around my parents' house because I couldn't sit still due to how nervous I was. I was so scared that everything about reality started to feel 'unreal' (something like derealization). My mother, after weeks of seeing me so nervous, tried to convince me that there's an afterlife, and although I believed it at first, the extreme anxiety and the fear of death came back after a while. When I think about death, everything else, all the other problems I have, and my life goals stop mattering. I feel no sexual impulse at all; having a romantic partner doesn't interest me, not even my future. Do I really need to do something if I'm going to disappear forever and I'm going to forget absolutely everything?? I'm studying engineering in college at least, but I feel that's not enough for the average 21 year-old, but the anxiety is killing me, and I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses, but I feel like I'm too exhausted to work and study at the same time. When I start to feel good about something, after a few minutes of being in that state, the thought about death always comes and my happiness fades away completely. I'm quite 'used' to being scared now, but it gets tiring.

I remember that I tried to talk about this with my classmates (I have to admit that no one was my friend, so they were only classmates for me) and every single time I said it, they stood there, confused, and always told me that I was too young to think about that. I went to therapy to talk about this too, and I could only afford group therapy, so the moment I had the guts to tell this everyone looked at me confused, exactly the same reaction my classmates had; the therapist didn't have any advice for me. Sometimes I think that being 'mentally stable' it's just the brain tricking us to not think about bad things (like death, although there's much more) too much. I personally believe that the brain has the thought of death blocked in the majority of people, but, for some reason, my brain doesn't do that.

This last year I started to feel scared about the possibility of dying young too, maybe due to an accident or a disease. And although I've never been religious, it's really scary to think that there's no god or mystical being to save me or have compassion for me or anyone else.",1755014066.0,1,1,Anxiety,anxiety

This summer I’ve been dealing with extreme anxiety and panic attacks and feeling like my medicine wasn’t doing anything so I found a psychiatrist and was diagnosed again with GAD and with panic disorder.

1moayde,Afraid to go for walks,"I want to start walking for my health, both physical and mental. However, my anxiety surrounding going out for walks is very high. 

For context, I (18F) am quite short for my age and look far younger. My area is not particularly dangerous, but I wouldn't exactly call it safe, either. I also have severe social anxiety, such that leaving the house is very difficult. It feels like people are watching me and picking me apart in judgement, or are making fun of me. Typical experience, I think. My low self esteem doesn't help. However, I think this could be managed by slow and short walks in familiar areas. 

The thing is, another concern of mine (and I assume much more irrational) is safety. Music, audiobooks, podcasts, etc would be very useful for ignoring the outside world and having walks be a calming part of my day. The issue is that I'm extremely paranoid about kidnapping, stabbing, theft, and issues like this, and of course headphones would make me less aware of my surroundings. It sounds extreme, but this is a reality for many young women and every time I think of going for a walk, this is the biggest barrier. Stabbings are quite common amongst young people in my city, and several young boys have died from them recently. I do think that these were related to issues within their lives though, like premeditated attacks rather than random stabbings. But still, it's a horrible thought. Pepper sprays and self-defence weapons aren't legal where I live.  

I would love a walking pad (those ones for the desk) because that would make exercise itself far easier and accessible as I wouldn't have to leave the house, but this isn't feasible. I don't have the money or space for a mat, even though they can be quite small, unfortunately.

This isn’t the first time and it has been going on for a very long time. Years. A typical day for me would be to go to work come home and on the ride home begin ruminating about all of the interactions that I’ve had for the day. I will then have physical cringe attacks whenever an interaction comes up where I feel like it was embarrassing or I was stupid. My ruminating is not limited to interactions that took place within the day, but will also cover interactions from when I was a child.

My physical reactions to these memories is that my hands will tense up, feels like I can’t breathe sometimes, and I will audibly react. My audible reactions are completely involuntary and so embarrassing when they happen in public. I have noticed though that my audible reactions have gotten worse. The sentences that I would blurt out have gotten worse. It started with blurting out something like I love myself to now being I want to die. I do not want to die for the record. 

I don’t really have anyone here that I can talk to nor can I afford a therapist yet. To be honest, I’m not sure what I’m looking for with this post. I guess I’m just really wondering how long I’m going to be like this as it really does affect my day-to-day life. I just keep envisioning the day that this gets better.

I’m a 29-year-old guy who’s generally pretty happy and gets really into my interests—like right now I’m deep into game development, and when I’m working, I’m usually just immersed and loving it. Even my entertainment tends to revolve around watching other game dev YouTubers or obsessing over whatever show I’m into.

But here’s the catch: whenever I hit a big break—like summer vacations when I was younger, or now when I took a pause from my game dev project—my anxiety just spikes through the roof. I end up in these weird depressive-anxiety loops where my mind grabs onto health-related fixations—like suddenly I’m hyper-aware of my breathing, my heart rate, or feeling like I constantly need to pee. It’s like my brain just needs something to latch onto, and when I don’t have a project or a positive obsession, it goes straight for these negative loops.

I have to say that this did not occur recently but for a few years now but it wasn't as worse as right now. I started noticing my head shaking 5 years ago when I try to stand still either during a presentation or school assembly (or just in a crowded room) but that wasn't too bad as it would just restore normally when I just move my body.

It starts to get worse when I am in college; I always get nervous in a crowded room but my head doesn't vibrate back then compared to right now, if I am eating together with friends in a crowded place my head would start to shake and I look stupid/experience difficulty in trying to eat or drink as my head isn't standing still (This doesn't affect me socially though as I can engage in one-on-one conversations with people without my head shaking). Even during writing examinations, it starts normally but as time goes on it would start shaking uncontrollably and it would get very uncomfortable/embarrassing.

What I physically felt is that the back of my neck would ""tense""? up before my head would start shaking. It is physically uncomfortable.

Other unrelated/non-head shaking issues I have is if I try to balance a small cup filled with water in my non-dominant hand, my hand would shake/vibrate like crazy. Or when I am typing too fast in a keyboard my hand would twitch and jump awkwardly.

I don't smoke, drink, do illegal substances or consume coffee.

I am going to the doctor in a few days but I made this post just so that I can expect if what I have is anxiety and not anything worse like neurological problems, and if anyone is facing a similar problem.

TL;DR, when I am nervous, stressed, anxious or overstimulated, my head would start to shake/vibrate uncontrollably. It makes me look stupid and uncomfortable. Is this anxiety?

I have a very very sensitive gag reflex, and when I feel sick, I tend to freeze because moving makes me vomit. This tends to happen to me almost every day.

This all started when I was a kid, then went away for a few years, but came back a few months ago after I got really sick. Anti-nausea meds haven’t helped.

These symptoms have been really disruptive to my life lately. I’ve missed my big drift events, work, and other important parts of my life. 

Sometimes vomiting actually helps relieve the nausea temporarily, but the cycle is exhausting and stressful.

I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with something similar? How do you cope? Any advice or just knowing I’m not alone would mean a lot.",1754990005.0,2,0,Anxiety,anxiety

1mo7ucq,Tired of my mind switching between different worries,"For several years I was feeling a lot of anxiety about my younger brother's well-being. Now that he is doing better in life, I don't feel worried about him. But for the past month now I've had another anxiety creep up again, this time relating to my mind/medication. I keep feeling anxiety over whether or not I've lost control of my mind since I feel more spaced out/brain fog than normal. And I also worry that I might have received a bad batch of Lexapro and/or multivitamins, but I've been taking name brand versions of both for several years now.

1mo7r2y,Letting myself fail a final,"Hello, I (21F) am currently in a calculus summer course at my uni and have not kept up with anything. our grade is mostly comprised of assignments and homework, and than 40% of it is the final. I currently have a 92 in the class, but that’s only because i’m able to use my resources for open book assignments. i haven’t spent any time actually understanding or memorizing the concepts. 

My final is in two days and i’m completely paralyzed by anxiety. i’ve been getting sick and crying every time i try to study. I have never been the type to set myself up for failure, so i’m trying to tell myself it’s okay if i fail this test, and potentially the class. This summer i’ve worked a full time internship, a job, and took two other classes on top of that. I’m trying to remind myself that absolutely bombing this final and potentially leaving it completely blank when i get it won’t kill me, and i’ll be okay, but i can’t help but still feel anxious. i want to not care and just let everything happen on its own, but i can’t stop the physical anxiety ive been feeling.

1mo7otp,I REALLY NEED HELP. Propranolol and being so detached and disconnected and lack of feelings.,"So i started taking propranolol 40 mg extended on 1st august and around 4th august i started feeling really dissociated. It’s like i know people but how do i connect to them? I feel scared looking in the mirror like i have to remember that this is myself. I don’t know how to explain this. I used to love and feel but i just can’t now, i think i cant even cry properly, i just don’t feel nothing but i did 2 weeks ago. I’m so so scared of this feeling. It’s like losing my mind-( will i forget everything? Will i start feeling emotions again? Will i be able connect with surroundings again) It’s giving me even more anxiety but can’t feel it physically on propranolol.

Background, I had hormonal imbalance starting july after which i started having anxiety which i never had before. I was doing better and better everyday till i started taking propranolol because i wanted to get better faster. So i cut my dose half day before yesterday to 20 mg extended and today i cut it down to 5 mg IR. It’s giving me withdrawal also. I don’t know what to do.

Am i stuck like this? Is propranolol actually causing this? I really need hope? Has anyone gone through something like this?

1mmzxmg,Can't believe ChatGpt lead me to ER,"I wanted to share this because it was a big wake-up call for me. (I also feel very stupid)

One day during a heatwave, I started feeling awful: overheated, dizzy, heart racing like crazy. I panicked and decided to ask ChatGPT what it could be. I described everything exactly as I felt it. It gave me a few possibilities, but also told me that based on my description, I should contact emergency services “just in case.”

I was already terrified, so I did exactly that. I called, they sent help, and I ended up at the hospital. They ran tests, monitored me, and told me I was physically fine. They said it was a panic attack triggered by exhaustion, lack of sleep, and the heat.

And the sad truth is… I didn’t want to believe them. I thought maybe they missed something, maybe they were wrong. I kept replaying the symptoms in my head, doubting what they said. My health anxiety made it hard to trust even the people who actually examined me.

Looking back, I realize AI is programmed to be cautious, and it can’t see the whole picture. But for someone with health anxiety, hearing “call emergencies” can make you spiral even harder.

I’m supposed to leave for a three-week trip to South East Asia with a group of friends tomorrow. We’ve been planning all of this for months now, with accommodation booked and (almost) everything arranged.

I have been dealing with anxiety for quite some time now and it always kind of flares up before going on trips, but it’s never been that bad. I’ve been losing sleep and been barely able to eat for a few days now, and since this morning I’ve started gagging and dry heaving.

Honestly I’m just about to cancel this whole trip and I feel pathetic about it.

1mo0bde,Frequent peeing with anxiety?,"Very weird topic but I have dealt with this for years and I am now starting to wonder if it is directly linked to my anxiety.

I often find myself having to pee multiple times a day. Like upwards of 10-20 times a day. I don’t have diabetes and bloodwork has always come back clean. I have always suffered from bad anxiety, which has gotten worse the past few years. Have been on an SSRI for years and recently started a beta-blocker due to big increase in physical symptoms from anxiety, like racing heart and palpitations, kind of like a negative feedback loop situation.

I do drink water but not nearly as much as I should. I don’t have a large fluid or caffeine intake at all. If I am relaxing at home or lying down in bed, I will have frequent urges to pee about every 45 minutes. My bladder would be nearly full each time. But if I am at a class or working or distracted, I could go hours and hours without peeing and barely feel any urge.

1mo613g,New Health Anxiety Persona with Rapid Weight Loss. Am I being too extra?,"Long story short i have a heart condition called Brugada Syndrome (found out last year). I have been fine about it for almost 10 months. I recently found out im moving countries and starting a new job with a new company (first new job ever since i left college). In May someone in my family made some nasty comments to me about my health condition that then spiraled me into a panic attack. I woke up the next morning and felt so light headed, dizzy, my muscles ached, i had MASSIVE brain fog, tension headaches, my testicles were hurting, my back and ribs were hurting. Something ive never ever experienced before.

I waited a few days for it to pass and it never did. My BP was 140/104. I went to the ER. They said it was just stress. My blood work looked fine. They gave me some BP medicine to help (it did).

Since i didnt feel better ive done the following tests:

CT Scan of Pevlis/Abdomen. Nothing requiring a follow up  
CT scan of the Brain. Nothing  
Ultrasound of my testicles. Nothing  
Multiple blood tests. Minus my WBC being on the low end of normal, everything was okay.

I then went to my GP and she said minus cholesterol being high, everything else was normal. I was still feeling fatigued/join paints. So i went back again a month later. They checked my vitamin levels this time. Vitamin D deficient and low on B.  She starts me on high Vitamin D pills. That did improve some of my lack of energy etc.  This lack of oversight from the get go made me question EVERYTHING.  Why did i have to follow up, why did i have to say other things for you to check my vitamins? This caused me to go on  a massive blood work spiral. I checked my Thyroid, my ANA, my TSH3/4 levels etc. Nothing too concerning minus Iron Saturation.

**My Current worry:**

Im 5'6 M. In the span of May 14 to today i dropped from 194 Pounds to 180 pounds. I did change my diet rapidly in the beginning. That saw a drop of 194-183 pounds from may 26 to june 29.

Then from June 29 July 29 i went from 183-180 pounds. During this time, i changed my diet to consume more calories because i was nervous of how much weight i was losing. I wanted to gain that weight back so i started consuming more food back when i was obese. I havent gained any weight and im still floating at 179-180 pounds right now but im obsessively checking my weight 3-4 times a day. My stomach still feels bloated,my bowel movements are weird (i am on vitamins and trace minerals right now) my back hurts, left side rib hurts, my thighs hurt etc.  I want to see a Gastro but im moving in 2-3 days, and insurance cutover to a new country will take some time.

This might be triggering for some, so please read it only if you are okay with this topic. 

As said I am really terrified to be unemployed. I currently have an 8 hour/week job which I'll certainly have till the end of September. I might get a new contract for 3 months but after that it is unlikely that I'll get a new contract. 
I am currently studying for my masters degree and I am afraid I won't find a job. I know this is mostly because I panic a lot in uncertain situations. I study animal sciences and before that I studied agrosciences. 
I am still young (23) and I am wealthy for a student I would say, and I get money from my parents every months, which covers my expenses, but nonetheless I am terrified to be unemployed.
Do you have any recommendations how to handle the emotions with something like meditation?. I am in therapy already. Did you experience a similar thing?
I thought about how it would be not to have a job after the next contract... I'll have to write my master thesis and there are some big assignments I'll have to do... so maybe some extra time for that would be actually nice. But I am afraid :(

I wake up, shaking, shivering with cold and then the next minute, I'm sweating. I can't eat, don't want to eat and feel nauseous when I do. 

I have a cause for the anxiety, my brother and his family are moving home from abroad and have tasked me with sorting out housing and I keep coming up short. I feel immense pressure to find a solution for him, guilt that if I don't, he may not come home at all (he's been away 15years) and our elderly parents won't get to see him or his wife and kids or that they arrive here and find there's nowhere to stay.  I have tried asking him to delay things but he says he has booked the flights and so is coming regardless.

I really just want to tap out of the role of Fixer but it's been a lifelong job I got lumbered with.

I rang the Samaritans this morning and the advice they gave - What would you tell a friend in the same situation? - was so reasonable (my answer would be to tell that friend to put themselves first & let the brother sort himself out) but I still can't seem to let myself off the hook for it. I am soon to be finally moving in with my partner after a long time together and all of this stuff with my brother and his family (happening around the same time) is taking all of the shine and joy from my own move at a time when I should be deliriously happy, finally moving into my forever home with the guy I love.

I have been on medication for anxiety, maybe 15 years ago and so I suppose if things don't improve, I'll go to my GP.  I just want to sleep, for the constant internal voice chatter to stop.  I feel like the anxiety causes the exhaustion which in turn feeds the anxiety. 

I can't seem to ever focus on deep breathing when I'm like this. I have tried listening to podcasts and music. I can't concentrate to read, which is one of my very favorite things to do normally. 

I am going to work, it does take my mind of things a little, although, I'm typing this out at work right now so not sure how well that's going. 

I just want the calm to descend, the heaviness to be taken from my chest and shoulders and just to feel peace. I know, I hope, it will come but how long it takes is the worry.

This is especially worse for ppl who already have chronic pain and other conditions, as we won’t know if anxiety is exacerbating the symptoms (psychosomatic) or it is truly sth new.

I was talking with my psychologist today and she raised some good points: maybe the expectation of everything is “normal” is an illusion:So there is no true “average, happy, healthy” human as if that is a state that will be there forever.

We all have relatives passing away; And we will all be not so healthy one day as we get older. Experience pain and suffering is the norm a deep and full human life, as fearful as it is.

1mo2l61,Could this have been a panic attack?,"Let me explain. I’ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder for and while, and in hindsight suffered from it since I was a kid. I have def had anxiety attacks, but def not what I at least understand to be a panic attack. My anxiety has always been just a constant thing controlling my mind and life in many ways, that sometimes (used to) result in some anxiety attacks, but again it wasn’t anything crazy. However, a really weird thing happened to me a year ago now that I still can’t grasp. 

I do theatre. It the night after the second to last show of the run, and I was chilling at home at like 1am. I was totally fine, eating ice cream, and then BOOM. I felt this extreme restlessness, almost log bugs under my skin, around my whole body. My chest hurt, hard to breathe. I felt like I was burning and freezing at the same time, my limbs were tingly, and I had tunnel vision. I felt what I could only describe as restless leg syndrome x10 and on my whole body, I was thrashing  Bc around in my bed.  It really did happen within seconds. It was unlike anything I have ever experienced. The closest thing I could equate it to is drug withdrawals (i did a lot of drugs for a brief period Dw ab it), but even then it was pretty different too. I just thrashed in bed hoping it would go away. It did not. I stayed up all night and still felt it in the morning. I went to my closing performance around 12am, still felt it. I pushed through the whole 3 hour show (people said I seemed fine on stage, but I was in fetal position the whole time off stage). It fuckin sucked bro. It after a while it slowly got a little better, but continued strong even into the NEXT day. It didn’t start really going away until that evening, almost 48 hours after it had started, after having no my first full sized meal the whole time. At which point I went back down to mostly normal in probably an hour or maybe less. And now here I am a year later, and it’s never happened again. 

I am still perplexed about it. My dad is a doctor, and he retains that he thinks it was most likely a panic attack. But 48 hours? Like I’ve had anxiety attacks, usually partly triggered by outward forces. I def suffer from purely physical anxiety a lot, I very often just feel a tight, anxious pain in my chest for no reason. But this was even different from that. It didn’t feel the same, it felt like I was sick.

I always knew it was possible, but as time goes on I’m really starting to think maybe it is what it was. Especially as I type this out, this seems pretty similar to what I’ve heard of panic attacks and from a few people describing them. And omg now I’m just now looking at it does seem very similar symptoms. And I know that for some people it rlly does come from nothing like with me. But idk, it’s still hard for me to understand or accept. I mean, idk what I imagined a true panic attack to feel like, but it’s not at all like that. Like I could say the phsyical effects on me, but I find it rlly hard to explain what it really FELT like. And idk im starting to think maybe that maybe it’s just a tough pill for me to swallow, and a tough thing to admit to myself that’s what happened. 

BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND, to have it never happen again for over a year now (hoping to continue)? For it to happen during what has been the most mentally stable I’ve been in a very long time, and where I manage my anxiety quite well? It’s hard for me to decide. 

Long story short, I’m wondering for those of you who know you have or do experience panic attacks, how does it feel for you? Does it match with me?

She even threatened to take away my ear buds, which at school was my only sanctuary from everything. She also would complain about me not haveing a job and telling me constantly to get one. She's also super passive aggressive. 

They are only one part of it. Another teacher (on going theme with a lot of them), would baby talk me. They'd act like I didn't understand anything despite being in high-school. Its easier to ignore but annoying.

1mo1g0i,Zoloft,"Hello!

This may be a bit long and I apologise in advance, I recently experienced a few life situations that encouraged me to get back onto medication, whilst also dealing with anxiety.

I've been on Zoloft before and from what I recalled, it was a bad time upping dosages - and boy was I right. I started 25mg last Friday and I'm currently 5 days in, the doctor suggested I stay on 25mg for 4 days and then up it till 50mg, yesterday morning I woke up randomly at 4am and had the worst panic attack that I'd had in a while, I'm talking body burning, rushing thoughts.. The need to have someone close, the thought that it would never be over or that something was wrong with me. Eventually it subsided and I couldn't sleep, had a nap later on during the day and woke up to left over adrenaline and another mini panic attack.

Since then? I've been exhausted physically and emotionally because I'm constantly fighting to stay afloat. I've lost my appetite, always have this feeling of dread, a feeling in my sternum, a heaviness .. My whole body is still burning on and off, I can barely leave my room and I'm missing out on school. Then the other physical symptoms, the headaches, the dizziness .. The all over sense of just feeling ""off"". These feelings worsen after taking the tablet with food in the mornings and by 4-5pm it eases to something manageable, still with that feeling in the chest, but less dread.

I know there are other posts here, they say it gets better .. Some say week 1 and some say week 2, is anyone experiencing this, or has experienced this? 

I'm also avoiding on upping the dosage (was meant to today) and will be ringing my doctor to ask if I can just stay on 25mg for the moment .. I'm mainly on Zoloft for the anxiety. I just can't handle it right now, I'm a Mum of 2 and I feel like I'm fighting for my life.",1754980860.0,1,2,Anxiety,anxiety

My anxiety attacks have been pretty much non existent, I would have an occasional one maybe a few times a year. Now, over the last year, I’m having what I think are anxiety attacks. They present different now. I feel faint, legs weak and heavy.  Head and eyes fuzzy, faint feeling. Like the feeling you get if you are about to pass out from getting blood. It used to be occasionally while driving, esp when stopped at a red light. I’ve had to turn around a few times and call out of work bc it was so bad. I find now, it happens with injuries, say if my child gets injured, or I see blood , or I see someone with a cast on, or even someone talking something medical, Or even at my dr’s office. Which is weird bc I’m a nurse and I am fine when I see these things at work. I can look at wounds and start ivs, draw blood at work.  I also get these episodes in big crowds, stadiums, in my child’s class for things like back to school night, at the grocery store. I can see now why people become agoraphobic! 
My primary prescribed me Prozac. A few months ago. Well, I have terrible medication anxiety but I was so desperate that I did try it. I had terrible side effects. It was super activating. I was on it for 13 days. Gave me insomnia, no appetite, clenched jaw, tension, I felt unhinged. I had a few extreme what I guess were panic attacks ,prob the worst I’ve ever had, I almost went to the hospital. I swore I would never attempt meds again,  But these episode are ruining my life. I feel like I’m just pushing through each day in fear and not enjoying life. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow to discuss meds again but I’m sooooo petrified of the side effects

About 40 days ago, i was at a restaurant and i was sitting outside. A friendly stray cat walked up to me and i gave it a pet. I remember right after it i washed my hands then i opend up chatgpt and asked about rabies. I wrote to it (i still have it in my history) that it didnt scratch me or anything, and of course i got the response that i am okay. I saw that cat a couple more times while we were there, just chilling, laying in the shadows, walking close to people. And i was good, i didnt think about it anyomre…UNTIL

A couple days ago i saw a facebook post that a man got scratched by a cat in the neighborhood and is looking for the cat’s owner. In the comments someone was telling him to go to the ER rn, and get the vaccine for rabies. And this very comment took my health anxiety to a 100.

Even tho i have the chat history in chatgpt that the cat i pet did not scratch me or anything, i am questioning it if maybe i was wrong and it did scratch me and bit me and i just didnt notice it because it was slight. I cant focus on anything, my brain is telling me that i have the rabies and it stresses me out so bad. I am constantly researching it, i even found out that rabies in my country is very very rare but still nothing helps. God i even called the restaurant pretending to be someone else and asking about if they saw a black cat since.

I know that most likely, i am good, but with this health anxiety and this ocd now, i cant calm myself down. Im so stressed and afraid that i have the rabies and i cant do about it anything now. For seconds/minutes i can calm down but then right after the “what if” and catastrophizing thoughts come back and i am back to square one.

1mnrt3f,Possible bat/rabies exposure? But probably not.,"Not seeking medical advice. I’m a hypochondriac, and I have an innate fear of rabies. 
A few nights ago, my two kids, husband and I left the park and walked back home. On our way, we saw a dozen bats low overhead, flying around. 
My husband kept a good eye on the kids and I and I watched the kids as well. We quickly moved out of the area in about a minute, but as we were walking, I felt two pokes (like teeth marks) behind my leg. I waited a moment (terrified) then looked behind me and didn’t see anything. My husband was looking up and away in that moment, and my son was also looking up. I briefly looked around and didn’t see any bats near me (and I never felt fluttering against me). I assume that if a bat did fly in between my husband and I, my husband would’ve see it with his peripherals. When I turned around to see if anything was behind me, he looked at me and smiled (no he didn’t poke me). 

So it seems very unlikely that a bat swooped through the air to bite my leg. 
So maybe it was my mind? Or a bug? I had pricked my other leg earlier on a yucca, and still felt the slight poke randomly that night. I have terrible anxiety and can occasionally make myself feel physically sick if I feel like something is wrong. Could I have made myself imagine the pinprick on the back of my leg? 

I called my states health department and they said that the event is considered low risk. He said that I’d likely feel more of the bat, flapping wings, and I likely would have seen it when I turned around.

1mnzh0g,anxiety induced psychosis,"so i was diagnosed with GAD around five or six years ago, and ive been trying out medications all throughout those years.

around March, i decided to try not taking any medications at all because i had been on them for so long, and i wanted to see what symptoms were caused by the actual illness and not just a side effect of the medications i was taking. 

what resulted was an increase in very strange symptoms, that showed clear signs of anxiety, but also signs of what i would describe as “delusional thinking”.

i know there’s a lot of people who post on this subreddit and just worry in general that they are delusional when they find that they’re considering scary things that might be reality or stuff that might happen in the future when in reality it’s just severe anxiety or OCD, but i truly feel like what i was experiencing fits into the category of actual delusional thinking.

i did experience increased agitation, fear, apprehension and worrying, but i also began to fully believe things that weren’t true at all/were strange and bizarre, and what i feel like makes it distinct from anxiety is that fact that some of these beliefs weren’t always negative and weren’t paired with only fear and worry; it could be any sort of emotion, sometimes even joy. 

for example, i could believe that i was the “chosen one” or that an object being the color blue meant that something good was going to happen. Admittedly, even during these “beliefs” i felt slightly “off” in the sense that i was on edge and restless.

also, when i believe these things, i don’t view it as a “what if” thought, like “what if this bad thing happens” or “what if im a bad person” like it’s specifically from uncertainty. i view it as a firm belief that isn’t based on uncertainty, like something that’s obvious.

for an anxious thought, you might say to someone “you don’t know that for sure, you have to embrace uncertainty” but for these thoughts that i was having i would just realize that i incorrectly perceived a situation  and think “that’s just not true at all” and feel like i was going crazy and was losing track of what’s real and what’s not. 

all of this went away when i started taking medication again, buspirone, which told me that these symptoms were paired specifically with anxiety, since buspirone only targets anxiety if i remember correctly.

I know it’s just a picture to everyone else in my family.
To them, it’s a happy moment. A memory worth capturing.
But for me, it’s something else entirely.

I’ve felt this way since I was a kid.
Probably self-esteem issues. Insecurities. I’m self-aware and considerate enough to keep in mind family photos are making THEM happy and I should want to do that…
But the only way I’ve ever managed to feel okay with who I am is by hiding.
I feel safest when no one even remembers I exist.

Being forced into family pictures always becomes a reminder.
A reminder that even in moments where I was supposed to feel joy and love, I felt anxious and disconnected.
And it shows. Maybe not to them, but I see it.

No one ever asks why it’s hard. They just get frustrated.
But I don’t need another lecture or more coping skills right now.
I need someone to gently ask what’s going on before assuming I’m just being difficult.
I already tear myself apart every day. I don’t need help doing that.

I understand it seems ridiculous. I really do.
But when someone says “It’s just a picture,” all I can think is what about next year? Or the year after that?
All these photos keep stacking up.
And every time I look at them, I see people I love looking alive, joyful, present.
Then I see me. Trying to fake it. Trying to smile. Trying to be enough. 

People say they want to remember me, but for me, pictures are just permanent images of a version of myself I never feel proud of.

I’ve accepted that I’ll probably be alone. That’s fine.
But one day when all I have left are these pictures, I’ll still see the same thing.
Them, looking worthy.

I’m only sleeping about for hours a night and I wake up constantly yelling and screaming. I’m afraid to sleep because of that and just also I’m afraid I’ll die in my sleep.

I left behind my boyfriend and some of my best friends, though luckily one of my friends moved with me. But here's the thing: I moved because I got my dream job that I've been working towards for YEARS. I even adopted my first ever cat, which I've also been dreaming of for years. So many good things have lined up for me to get here.

Yet, I feel so, so unbearably sad. Ever since I moved, I've had this pit in my stomach that won't go away, and I break into uncontrollable tears every spare second. I feel crazy, and when I try to explain it to people, no one really gets it. I can't even sleep at night, which I'm sure isn't helping. My boyfriend and friends are sympathetic, but I don't feel like I can even fully express everything I'm feeling to them because it's so heavy. I also can't talk about it all the time, even though I'm FEELING this way all the time.

I feel so guilty that I'm feeling so terrible when I got everything I've ever wanted. Plus, my boyfriend is only four hours away. I keep telling myself to pull myself up and stop moping, but I don't think that's helping. I just don't want to feel like this anymore.

1mnjyfi,Panic attacks have returned with a vengeance.,"Today I decided to walk to my friends. She's going on holiday and I'm staying at hers for 5 days. It's a good 7 miles but done this walk lots of times.

I got about 1/4 of the way in and I was convinced I wouldn't make it. Not sure if it's the heat, or feeling off. I had my rucksack on with clothes, and a bag of spray paints to do some art while I'm there.

I started feeling weak, dizzy, and sweating everywhere. I was convinced these were the symptoms of a heart attack and I must be dying. After 5 minutes I couldn't control my thoughts anymore, it was like I was merely observing the negativity, racing by at a million miles per hour.

I walked passed an old guy, and noticed he wasn't sweating. So my ill logic told me it's likely a heart problem.

I seen a cafe so I went in and asked them to call a taxi. I accidentally told them ambulance, before I corrected myself. But they seen something was off because I was drenched head to toe. I was shaking and talking really fast.

She told me to bring my dog in and sit down, so I did. I was trying to remain calm waiting for the taxi. There were a few people on tables near me and I started getting nervous of everyone. I went outside. My heart rate was in the 180's which made me worse.

The taxi eventually came, and it was a hellish ride. The panic attack didn't stop until I got to my friends house and was able to do some meditation. 10 minutes after getting there I was fine, albeit worn out.

Feeling deflated. I thought I was passed these types of panic attacks. I'm no stranger to low grade panic, it's ever present. But these massive panic attacks leave a mark that I can't forget. I felt like I was going to die and at one point accepted it.

1mnsnw6,Outwardly calm despite crippling panic attacks,"(I am diagnosed professionally with GAD, so don’t come here saying I probably don’t have it, like someone did with one of my old posts)

I have panic attacks on an almost daily basis, and have since I was a child, to the point I am outwardly very calm or neutral, despite being a screaming and trembling mess on the inside.  I have been told before by family that I can’t have been having a panic attack, because I wasn’t shaking or crying.  I cannot physically cry for the life of me for some reason.  The only times I have ever cried is when my pets have died or during extreme trauma.  Even during very bad episodes of depression and anxiety, I cannot cry.

My whole brain zaps and attacks me during panic attacks.  Everything feels blurry and like I’m not there.  I feel so disoriented that I feel like I cannot stand, and my suicidal thoughts are so overwhelming that I feel I cannot function, but I appear very calm and normal on the outside.

Some people in my life think I’m faking just to get drugs.  I swear on my life that I’m not.  Sometimes, I hyperventilate and freak out, but not usually.  My heart just beats extremely fast and I feel like I can’t breathe, but I seem totally fine to others.  Sometimes, I’m scared I’m having a heart attack and I’m going to die on the spot.  I always feel like I’m being strangled to death and like I can’t speak, so I just stand there silently when people are talking to me.

1mnwwo9,Anxiety/Chest Pain,"Why is it that when I’m having very bad chest pain (that just recently started after a bout of Covid) I can take alprazolam and the pain goes away? 

I’m diagnosed with anxiety disorder and went to the ER 4 different times last year after quitting weed (which I’ve recently quit again as of 1-1/2 weeks ago) and had all the usual tests done (bloodwork, EKG, etc) and they came back normal every time. Back then the chest pain was focused more on my left side, now it’s more in the center, as if there’s a weight on my chest. But each and every time I take an alprazolam it goes away. 

I understand that anxiety can definitely cause chest pain/tightness, but can it cause the type of chest pain where it feels like something heavy on your chest? I really don’t want to go to the ER for a 5th time just to end up in more debt and be told it’s nothing, again. I also can’t afford a doctor’s visit for the same reasons. 

I know I’m not having a heart attack or anything like that because it’s been ongoing for weeks now. I just don’t know what else it could be and have a hard time believing that it’s just from anxiety, even though I’m a constant nervous wreck. Social anxiety, health anxiety (extreme) and cardiophobia, which all of this is exacerbating. 

Lastly, I was prescribed a Z-Pak for a possible secondary infection from the covid and only took the first 2 doses before reading that Azithromycin can prolong the QT interval in your heart. So I went about a week ago and had an EKG that was normal, aside from sinus tachycardia and a very slightly prolonged QT interval (normal is 440ms, mine was 443ms). So I’m pretty sure it’s nothing serious, just needing reassurance.

So I wake up feeling like that but I try not to think about it but it doesn’t go away even if I want it to. For the first time I noticed that after a couple of days after stressful events, my calves feel heavy and sore as if I’d been walking all day even when I haven’t. And I know school triggers me really bad especially when it’s the first day back or I sometimes randomly wake up with really bad anxiety. And it’s also my hands twitching and shaking and sweating and I feel like everyone is looking at me when I try to tell myself they aren’t. This happens when I get on the bus and when I KNOW I’m getting close to school my body feels again so shaky and I’m so sick and tired of this happening always.

1mniecm,"Visual/cognitive changes over a month, am I alone in this?","I’ve had OCD for a long time now, and sometimes it manifests somatically and as health anxiety. But the last few weeks I’ve been having some really troubling symptoms and I’m trying to bring myself back to earth and avoid the symptom checking spiral that sends me to the doctor or ER when I didn’t need to be there in the first place. 

The last few weeks I have had some pretty distinct visual changes. I will say I went to the doctor because I lost half of my vision in my left eye and it turned out to be a retinal tear that I got repaired, so that might have something to do with it. But while reading my eyes just cannot glide over sentences as smoothly as they used to. They jump all over the place and it makes it so I can’t understand the information I’m reading. These jumpy jerks in vision also persist when I’m looking around at things, especially when I move from one object to another. It’s like my eyes go in and out of focus and leap all over the place, it feels like an actual muscle twitch or vibration. 

The most troubling, though, has been the cognitive changes. I have been noticing that I forget words very often, much more often than usual. They’re not words that are so common that I should remember them with ease, but I have the ‘it’s on the tip of my tongue’ moment way too much. Like multiple times a day. Also, I feel like I just can’t understand things as easily as I used to, especially when reading them (though this may be due to my vision issues). I have never struggled with comprehension and word recall and so this is extremely distressing to me.  I also just kind of lack the luster and wit in conversation I used to have. I can’t come up with easy jokes like before and can’t think of interesting things to say. Describing my thoughts and feelings feels like an uphill battle of trying to organize the words and get them out eloquently without repeating myself too much and in a way that makes sense. Like I’m trudging through really thick muck in my head all the time. 

In all the years of having anxiety I’ve never had this.  I have definitely been having the out of body sensation that I know is anxiety. My head feels floaty which I know is also anxiety. But this just seems so extreme. Like, I’ve had anxiety so bad before that it rendered me pretty much nonverbal and useless for weeks and I never felt this way. 

Has this happened to anyone before? Should I take this more seriously than I am? I don’t like to jump to the doctor over everything cause I feel like that degrades my credibility as a patient overtime, so when something does actually need attention and they see on my chart how hypervigilant I am, always the boy who cried wolf, something might be missed.

For the last year I’ve been constantly dizzy, feel like I’ll actually faint sometimes, just feel out of it as if I’m drunk and my heart feels like it’s beating fast although according to my Apple Watch it’s within a normal range. Just feel completely not with it and not like myself. My vision just feels off and legs feel like jelly, also constantly sweating. 

It’s not so bad when I’m at home but when I try to go in shops it’s so bad that most of the time I have to leave or I just can’t go in. The thing is I don’t mentally feel anxious, the only thing I get worried about is fainting in front of other people which makes me not want to go in places even more. 

I’ve had blood tests, ecg, blood pressure taken etc even my eyes tested, still wear glasses and nothings changed there. They said my blood pressure was slightly low but nothing alarming. Im at my wits end now because I can’t leave the house, I’ve never experienced this before and in the past year that it started, nothing in particular caused it. 

Originally I thought it was due to vaping but I’ve always smoked and vaped and I don’t have strong nicotine in it. I’m currently on a cardiology waiting list for a 24hr blood pressure monitor and tilt table test but I’ve already been waiting months so could still be a while yet. 

I have a stock of citalopram that I’m thinking of starting again as I used to take it but I didn’t feel like it worked much although maybe I didn’t give it enough time. Has anyone else dealt with this? It seemed to get better at the end of last year but now it’s the worst it’s ever been. Today i tried to go out for food with my partner and had to leave because I just felt like the room was spinning and like I’d collapse any second. 

I just can’t accept that it’s actually anxiety when I don’t even feel anxious? How can I feel sick and dizzy and everything else if mentally I don’t feel that way?

1mnsu9t,Getting away from my toxic father,"
Hey Reddit, I’ve been dealing with this for a while and honestly, I’m so tired of feeling stuck and suffocated. I’m 18 and living with my super conservative, patriarchal dad who thinks women belong at home and have no business working or moving out on their own. This has been going on since I was a teenager, and I see it’s the same way with my mom — she’s had so many restrictions her whole life, and now he’s imposing them on me and my sister too.

My dad is emotionally distant — all he really does is provide financially, which is great, but he doesn’t seem to care about getting to know me or who I actually am. To him, I’m just a daughter he needs to “guide,” and that guidance mostly looks like control. I’m not allowed to work, not allowed to move out, and even my freedom to hang out with friends or do normal stuff like go to college events or meet up with friends is constantly policed. Every time I want to go out, he gives out about how it’s “not proper” for a Muslim girl, questions what my friends are wearing, and makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong just by living my life. And then he just shouts. Gives out. Polices.

Recently, I came back from Pakistan after a solo trip to meet family, i wanted to meet up with some friends I didn’t see all summer. He gave out about the fact i wanted to meet up with them. “You’ve only just gotten back?!” As if it has any correlation. I feel trapped. Everything I do I need to double and triple think about so not to trigger him. It’s exhausting. I’ve managed to find some autonomy in college, but living under his roof makes it all conditional — I have to “show up” for him in his terms, cover my hair, and constantly censor myself

The only way I really see to get out of this is by moving out — but honestly, as a South Asian girl, that just feels so undoable. I want to get away in a way that doesn’t feel rebellious, something that won’t make him hate me or cause a huge family drama. So I’ve been thinking about studying abroad as my way out. But, man, it just feels so daunting — like, saving up money, learning new skills, figuring out how to actually make it happen, or worse not being able to go at all because again he won’t let me — it all seems so big and scary.

I just feel like I’m meant for so much more. I have so many passions and dreams, but I’m constantly pulled back by his rules and expectations.

What I’m really trying to gain here is hearing from someone who’s been in a similar position — how they dealt with it, tips on getting away, and how they became stable and got out of that control.",1754955137.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1mnsp9p,Severe Anxiety at night,"Hello, I’m just wondering if anyone can help me!

I’m a 22 year-old nursing student doing my undergrad degree and I’m feeling really overwhelmed. My anxiety gets extremely bad at night and is preventing me from being able to sleep.

For context, last year I was meant to submit my dissertation and graduate uni however I felt completely overwhelmed by it, I became extremely depressed, and left it until last minute. Since then, I’ve returned to Uni and still massively struggled with it, my dissertation is due in a week and still I have absolutely nothing. I’m currently awaiting an ADHD referral and I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression also.

I feel like I’m really deep in burnout right now, I owe a lot of placement hours so I’m staying in to make them up, my dissertation is due in a week and I’ve done nothing because every time I go to do it, it feels too overwhelming, I’m estranged from a lot of my family, I’m currently unemployed due to being on placement and I have to move out of my current accommodation in two weeks and I have nowhere to go and no money.

My anxiety gets worse at night, especially with the fact that I’m alone with my thoughts and I have no one to reach out to. Every time I go to close my eyes, I just have several voices in my head talking about how much I have to do tomorrow, how I have no idea what I’m doing with my dissertation, how I’m gonna fail and ruin my life, and the main thing that keeps me up is that whenever I tell myself that I’m gonna be okay and that I will get my dissertation handed in and everything will work out. It’s like there’s a voice in my head telling me that I’ve already struggled with it twice and so this time it’s not gonna be any different.

I have tried everything to try and sleep. I’ve taken herbal medication, melatonin, I’m currently on mirtazapine 15mg, I’ve tried changing the temperature in my room coming off screens before bed not drinking coffee after a certain period of time in the day listening to Rain Sounds and white noise etc nothing works.

1mnsjxa,Death Anxiety: My experience,"I decided to post this as I come across posts about death anxiety almost every day.
I have dealt with it. Even via therapy. So maybe I share some strategies


1. First of all I try to remember myself what I think about death as a phenomenon? I personally am Christian so according to my faith, it is just a transition. This helps. A lot. Are you religious/ spiritual? maybe focusing on faith can help you with this kind of anxiety. Because believing in some sort of after life concept can turn death into just a step or an experience in a never ending life cycle// or even as some atheists discuss - energy going nowhere phenomenon, can ease your 
mind. Like, adding a bit of a context to death. 

2. Even if you dont believe in anything, “good” thing about death is that literally every single being on this planet goes through it. Even if it sounds bad, lets be honest, sometimes egoistic thoughts can ease anxiety, as u realise you are not alone , LITERALLY, FACTUALLY! 

3. If the points above cant help you, try this quote: “sometimes we are afraid of dying because we are actually afraid of living” - when I went through therapy , my therapist repeatedly asked me the question: what are you really afraid of? several times until I answered that I was actually afraid of not  doing X Y Z before dying. And then basically i focused on how I could actually experience stuff I was too afraid to miss out on. As I got busy thinking what I could do to make my dreams come true and live the life worth being on this beautiful planet, I got no time left to worry about dying. Coz I literally became busy thinking about living. It doesnt happen overnight but if you work on yourself and are honest , this kind of approach can ease anxiety for sure. 

I wish you all peace of mind. Anxiety can be bad. I am an AuDHD woman with anxiety disorder and sometimes I truly think that my brain just does not know how to be calm and fully happy 😃 but even for someone like me, there is always a strategy you can find that works for you. My take is that we cannot solve mysteries like death, no matter how many times we ask here - no one can give a pro tip that will right away take the anxiety off our brain but what WE CAN do is find the root cause because in many cases death anxiety comes from other deeply rooted fears - in my case , I repeat, I was literally afraid of living.

1mnmnum,Anxiety and depression is keeping me from living,"
For some reason the thought of getting a job or moving out depresses me so much and gives me anxiety. I want to be able to do these things but my emotions paralyze me. Makes me feel like such a loser and failure. I don't why I'm like this. Years ago I had a job and once I had two jobs. I loved it but I quit because there was favoritism at my job. I was also getting less hours. I tried getting other jobs after that but I ended up quitting after the first day. One job I actually cried at and quit.. it was embarrassing. I don't know what happened. I can only think of the fear of working so much I don't have time to see family or have down time. Idk. It's like I feel like I'll be imprisoned and never get to go home. This fear is ruining my life. I feel useless. It's been happening for years. Anything involving change freaks me out. I’m own meds for anxiety and depression but I don’t think they are working. I made an appointment with my doctor and I hope she can help me. Does anyone else have this?

1mng3vz,Anxiety unbearable at morning/night,"I’m going through a breakup and really struggling with sleep and waking up. I think the mornings may be the worst.

My anxiety wakes me up hours earlier than I normally do (no matter how late I sleep), and throughout the night. When I wake up, my entire body feels tense and chest tight, I feel choked up and like I can’t breathe, I’m on the verge of tears, etc. 

When I actually get my day started, I feel anxious for hours and can barely function/talk in my morning meetings for work.

It only starts going away midday/later in the day….and even then it just transforms into a deep dread and depression. I just spend any freetime with mindless consumption (tv and social media) as a poor attempt to distract my thoughts.

It restarts at night when I’m going to bed…I just can’t sleep and lay in bed tossing and turning and panicking until my body physically can’t stay up for longer. 

I’ve tried breathing exercises but they don’t seem to work at all. It’s becoming absolutely unbearable and affecting my physical health and daily functioning.

Does anyone have any advice on how to alleviate this?

i know it sounds insane, i feel insane, and i hate living like this. i have safe foods, and im slowly adding some more since i released one lunch i had reduced myself to like 3 meals i could eat without panicking and was starting to stress over those too. and then obviously my anxiety makes me react which makes me worried, and the loop starts again.

issue is i have actually health conditions, and some like endometriosis I've already had to fight to be believed about, plus my weird rashes im waiting to see a dermatologist about. im worried if i mention this to a gp for advice or treatment I'll get labelled with it and never believed again even for real issues, and i cant afford private therapy

1mnro66,Some Facts on Breaking Down Anxiety Cycles and Tools That Might Help,"Anxiety often works in cycles, starting with a trigger, building rumination, and leading to avoidance behaviors, according to common cognitive models like those in CBT resources.

If you’re looking for a quiet spot to try this, I’d recommend something like VoidTalk AI, it’s a place to get things off your chest where no one will see it, it’s helpful to navigate feelings and problems without the pressure, my most favorite feature is the void where you can put anything in a text box and the void will eat it up forever being in the void for no one to see.

1mnhuu5,Tips for plane travel that have helped me,"Someone asked on an old post on how I was doing with my claustrophobia/agoraphobia from plane rides, and I was really encouraged to share a few things that have helped me - maybe they can help you too. 

Just background, I've always been a little claustrophobic since a child, but as an adult in my 30's, it now brings up anxiety that has led to a panic attack. It wasn't the flying itself, but the cabins were causing a ""trapped"" feeling. 

These are some tips for how I have overcome anxiety with flying in the past six months or so:

1. Exposure therapy: Kind of by accident, but I'm leaning into it - I'm flying a bit for work. I also fly into smaller midwest cities, so my planes tend to be leaner. At the beginning, I was really struggling, but it's gotten easier and larger planes now don't give me an issue at this time (we flew to and from London a couple weeks ago and I was fine). I don't want to be in a tiny plane at this time; we had a friend get their pilot's license and I had to kindly decline him taking me up in a plane. I'm taking my wins slowly and gaining momentum. 

2. Ice: When we're boarding and I get inside the plane, I immediately signal the flight attendant in the kitchenette area and ask for a cup of us. It typically doesn't require explanation, they don't mind. Once I said ""it's for flying anxiety"" and the girl had the sweetest 'oh you poor thing' look on her face and gave me the cup. Twice they couldn't give me the ice until everyone was boarded. The ice is now just a crutch, but at first, I would rub the ice up and down my arms, on the back of my neck, and held it in my hand (I would wear sleeveless tops purposefully for this, or at least short sleeved). You may look a little weird but who cares, it was making me feel better. The sensation centers me. I would goosebump and get cold, and I'd lean into the cold and stay cold as long as I could. This kind of leads into the third thing. 

3: Cold plunges: I actually started the ice because once I was showering once before a flight and I started to panic thinking about the upcoming plane ride - heart racing, vision narrowing, etc. I put my shower to the coldest setting (I've been doing this ever since starting cold plunges), and I was shocked when my anxiety plummeted as I stood under the fridged water. I realized that for me, I cannot maintain that level of anxiety while actively being blasted with cold water. We have well water, and it's COLD. I even tried to lean into the anxiety, testing the walls of my new theory, and nope, couldn't bring back the feeling of the emerging panic attack while in cold water. I took this idea to the plane and started asking for ice.

4. Medication: I got lorazepam as a crutch and that's all it's been. I've taken it and not liked the woozy feeling I personally get, so I take it rarely. I haven't had a panic attack where I've felt like I needed to quickly take it, but knowing I have it is nice. The ice is better, it's more shocking and immediate, and the lorazepam is there just in case. I had a 10 pill prescription given to me last fall and I probably have 5 pills left at this time (I actually just took one on my London flight to help me sleep, so not even for panic). 

I hope this helps someone. There's also something to be said about distracting yourself on the plane - When I'm boarding, I don't look ahead of me (and see the limits of the cabin), but look at the feet of the person in front of me, shuffling along with my bag and trying not to bump people. I also try to amp up how excited I am for *my* chair - as if the plane chair itself is a safe place. Cold showers aren't fun, neither are cold plunges, but because it's hard, it is strengthening that inner muscle of ""I can do hard things""; you bring that strengthened muscle with you when you board planes and you can lean into that inner strength.

I've tried grounding techniques, and they work to make the panic attacks less severe, but it feels like I still come back to the anxiety over and over.

Before that incident I THINK I had already accepted death (think because maybe denial? Idk). If it happens, it happens. I am no longer really afraid of what happens after because it’s something I can’t comprehend and honestly it’ll eventually happen. I’m fine with the thought of it, like I really am however for some reason I still have crazy health anxiety… 

When something feels off or looks off on my body my brain goes straight away to “DUDE YOUVE GOT SOMETHING TERMINAL! THIS IS IT!” and my brain just loops this whole thing that eventually leads me to feeling all anxious and panicky.

However, I have noticed a pattern. I am most anxious when I'm out on public or social settings with my husband.

For example, we recently went to a day concert and I had a really tough time keeping myself from having a panic attack and couldn't relax the whole time. Fast week a few weeks, I'm doing something similar but with friends. I was anxious in the beginning but after an hour or so, the anxiety eased and I had a really great time. 

In the past, particularly when we were first together he wasn't the most supportive but has supported me throughout our relationship.

Is it because I feel safer with him, so those vulnerabilities show more? 

When we are at home, we have such a great time together. He truly is my best friend.

Any insight is appreciated

About 6 months ago, I was lifting 5lb weights a few times a week, doing push-ups, squats, and other body weight exercises. None of it ever felt particularly challenging or taxing on me. 

Last week, I randomly decided to try lifting my little 5lb weights again and my arms immediately felt sore, heavy, fatigued, and were burning. The soreness was immediate and lasted days. My arms felt weak and also twitched in the upper areas at times.

Well, I am now feeling the weakness in both legs. My legs feel wobbly, get tired and sore VERY easily, and feel like they cannot sustain my weight. I also have twitches in the calves and thighs and a shooting pain at times in my right thigh. I just tried doing 5 squats, and that alone has caused me to feel like I ran a marathon immediately after. I feel like I can hardly walk.

1mnjno5,Can anyone relate?,"I’m wondering if anyone can relate to the rapid mood cycling I’ve been experiencing. I posted in the ask docs thread, but I don’t think anybody wanted to bite ha. I’ve had anxiety for most of my adult life, which worsened greatly in 2019 when I was a week postpartum with my second baby. I also developed panic disorder around the same time. I’ve only struggled with anxiety since then, except for after using a GLP1 called Zepbound from January to April of this year. 

On that medication, I felt myself slowly getting less motivated, experiencing less joy, and life feeling more dull. It all came to head on my last shot week when I woke up one day and developed extreme depression. I had never experienced depression before, or at least nothing major, hindsight maybe I’ve experienced walking depression before (I think that’s what it’s called) but when this happened, I woke up and felt like I fell off a cliff and had to have been the saddest person alive. I wasn’t suicidal in the sense I was making any plan, but I was convinced that if I continued being that sad, that would be how my story would end. It was the worst four or so days of my life, I was completely consumed by hopelessness and sadness.  I went to a walk-in clinic, because of course I couldn’t get in with my primary emergently, and she said that the Zepbound medication has been known to have a rare side effect of suicidal ideation and depression. She suggested I go off of it and said I would probably feel back to my normal self within one to two weeks. I did, and it did take a few days, but I did start to feel relatively normal again. 

However, ever since this first episode, I experience extreme depression, hopelessness, and sadness Every three or so weeks. I fall into a deep pit of despair, lose all joy, don’t really see the point to life, nothing interests or excites me, I feel detached from loved ones, and extremely extremely hopeless. I was on Prozac for the last year for my anxiety and panic, and when the first depressive episode started, I went off of it, and I have now switched to Pristiq, which I’ve been on for four weeks. 

What I’m experiencing now, and have been for the last month or so, is rapid cycling of emotions throughout the day. I can be happy and euphoric one minute, and literally a minute later feel hopeless. My emotions last a couple minutes each, the highs and lows, And cycle over and over throughout the day. I’ve done a lot of googling, a lot of creeping on Reddit, and the only thing I can come up with is potentially borderline personality disorder. Which I can’t imagine I just developed in the last couple of months. Maybe it’s a product of stress? On boarding of prestiq? 

Has anybody felt like this? You can be both happy 20 times in a day but also hopeless 20 times in a day? I just want to feel normal again! I do see a therapist, I was prescribed the Pristiq by a psychiatrist, and neither think I have depression, because my low moods do not last a consecutive two weeks each. The lowest lows are about 3 to 6 days long, and happen every 3 1/2 to 4 weeks. My therapist is suspecting maybe PMDD? But again, how does someone just develop that out of the blue!

1mnjnj7,Which tests should I request to get an accurate diagnosis?,"21M, 5'9"" 48 kg, have never smoked or consumed alcohol and not on any meds for a long time

I have forward head posture, which caused chronic suboccipital muscle tightness and pain starting over 3 years ago. An X-ray showed loss of cervical curve.

Over a year later after suboccipital pain began, woke up one night feeling extremely awful and nauseous, felt like I was going to die. A few days later, it happened again. Since that night, my life hasn’t been the same. I got an EKG and a brain CT scan which came out normal. Cardio and neuro dismissed my symptoms as anxiety since I’m young and nothing showed up on tests.

Before that night, I used to sleep 8 hours straight with no issues. Ever since, I’ve had poor sleep, vivid dreams, waking up 1–2 times a night, and always waking up unrested and fatigued. My suboccipital muscles stay very tight and painful. I spend a lot of time in bed, and if I stand up suddenly, I feel a bit dizzy. It's been over 2 years since this started.

My stamina has also dropped drastically. Before, I could walk up stairs without a problem, but now just 10–12 steps leave me breathless. Exercise and gym activity sometimes make me feel a bit better, but everything resets after I sleep, and I feel unwell again. I’m constantly on edge.

1mndilg,How to ask my doctor for benzo script for traveling?,"I have terrible travel anxiety. I can barely function while on trips. And I hate that my husband has to worry and take care of me during our travels. I try to mask it from my kid. Basically I’m just in a constant state of panic with elevated heart rate and can’t breathe. I have intense physical symptoms I can’t control, I have no appetite, I’m not only nauseous I actually vomit a lot and have digestive issues with non stop diarrhea. Just thinking about planning a trip sends me into panic mode now. I don’t know what sets it off, I feel perfectly safe, not scared of flying. The thing is I want to go on trips and I love the researching and planning. I just can’t actually enjoy it when it’s happening lol. Talking about it makes me very emotional so I never bring it up with my doctor. I think I also feel shame and embarrassment or scared I won’t be taken seriously. I want a benzo script just for travels. I can handle my regular daily anxiety fine. My SIL has given me a few of her pills in the past and it works like magic. I’m scared to ask my doctor. What if he says no, if he thinks I’m phishing for drugs. Please help me get in the right mindset to ask. Maybe I can write it down and hand him a note at an appointment? That also feels silly to me.

1mnj3zc,Depression-like feeling that comes and goes with anxiety,"I don't know if there is a spesific name for it but does anybody get really (like really) depressed when they have something that they worry about? I'm having a hard time explaining it because it's a little weird. It's not just those intense anxiety feelings. More like despair, loss of any kind of will to do anything, crying etc.

For backstory, I do have history of depression but one was 10 years ago and the other was during covid, which I'm sure most of us had some type of problems during than. Well since those 2 instances, I didn't really had a depression. My main problem is anxiety disorder, OCD and panic attacks.

So my ""normal"" mood in my anxiety-free or at least with less anxiety moments are quiet good. But when my anxiety gets fixed on something (at the moment I have some problems with my landlord) I get super depressed, really really bad. It's almost like I lose the will to live (not like self harm at all though, thankfully I never had that problem), it's really weird. It comes and goes constantly so it will go away now too I know but I wanted to know;

1) If this happens to other people too?

2) What do you guys do when you have this problem?

Anxiety already makes everything really hard to do when you are in those obsessive thoughts. But mixed with this weird depressed feeling, everything feels 10× harder. Like I don't even want to eat. Last year I had something in my life that gave me horrible anxiety and I was so depressed for 2 weeks until that problem was solved. I'm not talking about bad mood, literally it was so horrible. And it went away with the anxiety. But it repeats itself. I was diagnosed years ago with mood disorder but I don't think that this is it. Because this doesn't happen ""without a reason"". It literally comes and goes with the anxiety. Anyway, does anybody else has this?",1754932742.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

Since then, I see it everywhere.
I am NOT seeking it out. 
It will be ridiculous things like looking for a recipe on reddit and someone will be in the comments ""I like this channel on yt with awesome recipes, unfortunately they got cancer now and are in hospital""
Or I will watch videos on Youtube about mysteries and the top comment will be ""I'm dying of cancer and your videos make my day"".
This happens to me MULTIPLE times a day everywhere I browse, even when none of it has anything to do with illnesses.
Nevermind it extending to my offline life where people in public transport next to me will have no other topics than cancer. 
X just got diagnosed, X just died of etc, it's everywhere on the internet?

I've had PVC's for the past 18 months or so, along with general health anxiety chaos. I'm out of the worst of the health anxiety now, at one point it was REALLY rough.

One of the remaining symptoms seems to be persistent PVC's, some days I have none, other days I will feel 10 or so, and some days I'll get them a LOT whilst walking (every 10 steps or so, but this is usually after an incredibly high-adrenaline day - job interviews etc).

The thing that's freaking me out is that sometimes, along with a PVC, I get the most intense sweating, from my forehead and all down my back. This starts at pretty much the same time as the PVC, and then resolves within 5 minutes or so. I'm worried this is something more serious that benign palpitations/skipped beats.

Can't enjoy my car because I feel it will break someday, Can't enjoy my laptop because I think it will break, Can't enjoy my money because I feel I'm gonna lose it.

  
I think this problem comes from my parents what always lie to me about everything so they tell me the bad news when the problem can't be held by them anymore and need my help, these types of situation have been happening since 2 months ago. My dad got another woman pregnant and told me 5 months later, my mom knew it and just told me when she had a panic attack. My mom's family disappeared from our lives, dad's family too.

My Therapist told me a while ago that i had fear of losing caused by mom, when she had a severe thrombosis that almost kills me and kills her, she said that we as babys can feel what our moms are feeling in those moments.

My girlfriend is my only support and i don't want her to carry with my problems as my parents did to me, she sometimes tells me that i have a sad and worried face all the times ( not in a rude way, just concerned ) and i feel truly bad because I'm a good person, I really enjoy life and I'm always helping people with their problems because can't stop feeling sensitive about them.

1mnfxvl,Anxiety towards friends,"I’m a teen - and i wouldn’t say I have a ‘rough’ or ‘difficult’ life. I have supportive parents and a very supportive brother who i can talk to about anything. I have many friends who I can rely on and who support me. 

So talking on here feels weird as it looks like i’m attention seeking when i have it ‘better’ than others on here. 

But ever since i was ~13 I have been having serious anxiety, I thought it was just hormones etc but its only gotten worse over the years. 

And it’s mainly due to my friends, and like i said, I do love my friends and they’re all so supportive and kindhearted- but at the same time with some of them i feel as if i’m just waiting for them to get tired of me or lose interest in me. 

In my friendgroup dynamic, i would go to say i’m one of the more funny and intense people in the group - and I feel like i’ve been so used to making people laugh that it almost feels like I can’t be anything else - that as soon as i’m not funny or interesting enough they’ll immediately ditch me and find someone else more interesting to hang out with. 

and its so stupid to think this because i know they do love me and care for me, but this overwhelming anxiety always makes me feel like if i’m not the funniest person, if i’m not the centre of attention they’ll get bored of me and hang out with other people.

And this is the reason I can’t communicate to them how i feel - because it makes me look like a 100% attention seeker, and maybe i am - I mean, whenever the spotlight isnt on me, when i see my friends hanging out without me (which they can do ofc because its not out of malicious intent) I get so anxious that they’ll leave me that i can barely function. Pair that with my FOMO as well its not good. 

Its annoying to feel this way when i know my friend’s wont leave me - but i cant be sure and thats what makes me so afraid- i don’t exactly have that one ‘ride or die friend’ i have one friend who is almost my ‘ride or die’ but she makes friends so quickly, and since i’m going to 6th form (I’m british) and new people are joining my school - I’m terrified she will leave me and i’ll lose her as a friend. 

Every outing with my friends, beforehand i get super anxious to the point i can’t even sleep without dreading the meet up. 

This rant was mainly brought on because i have a sleepover tomorrow with a friend and i’m terrified the sleepover will be awkward and just boring - and that my friend will never want to do it again with me. ",1754925801.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1mnf84s,Anxiety when it comes to friends.,"I'm a young teen and I have a few friends and a lot of times, I'd find myself doubting their friendship. I'm very self conscious as a person and often believe that people wouldn't wanna be friends with me.

Ever since I was younger, I would be told by family that I was introverted or needed to get friends. Ofcourse, that didn't make me latch on to that one random person but it did hurt my feelings and formed my self consciousness over the concept of friends. I felt like people judged me whenever it comes to my friends. 

I constantly question lots of things about my friends which planted a seed of doubt in my head. 

I get upset when I'm usually the one saying hi or steering the conversation. 

I get upset when I realize that I've been friends with people for a little while and I barely know anything about them while they likley know a hundred things about me and it upsets me. I remember looking back on a friendship I had and it shattered me to realize I hardly knew anything about him despite being best friends. It feels like they flat out refuse to talk about their intrests even when I try to nerd out about it. 



I'm afraid of my friends eventually getting sick of me and deciding not to talk or engage with me. I feel like I ruin the mood by venting to them because I have no one else to vent to, even when they say that it's OK for the hundredth time. 

I constantly compared my friendships to others and ask as to why I don't have those types of friendships. Don't get me wrong, I have close friends who I love but it never stopped me from feeling like I cared more about them than they did back. 

Sometimes, I just wish I never had friends. I'm already soo insecure about other stuff and it feels like an extra load. 

I just wanted to vent and cry a little. thanks for reading

Any suggestions for navigating parental guilt?  

I have 2 kids on antidepressants and am trying to navigate tapering them off.  I have guilt about my kids being on medicine, fear about the consequences for them in the years ahead from the medications, anxiety about the unknown, pressure from the doctor to rush taking them off the medications in big dose changes, but also worry that it’ll be more than the kids nervous systems can manage.  My brain can’t compute it all.

My son is autistic and has been medicated for 5 years.  His life is a shadow of his peers and I know he wants so desperately to break free from medication (amongst other challenges he has).

hi. i’ve been dealing with really bad health anxiety and lately it’s been taking over my life. i’m constantly petrified i have breast C or colon C. i check my nipples every single day, i look at my butthole in the mirror, i used to inspect my stools every time i went, and now i even take pictures of my clothes to check if there’s any blood i missed.
i read reddit stories about people being diagnosed and it just makes it worse. if i get a random pain or weird feeling, my brain jumps straight to “this is C word” and i can’t focus on anything else. sometimes the anxiety gets so bad it causes gas, stomach pains, tingling and then i spiral even more because i think it’s a sign.

i’m anxious this is going to follow me into college and ruin the experience for me. i don’t want to spend what’s supposed to be some of the best years of my life constantly scanning my body and thinking i’m dying.

i know most of these checks aren’t healthy but in the moment it feels like i have to do them to feel safe. except i never really feel safe and the relief only lasts a few minutes before the “what if” thoughts start again.

i also check for lumps all over my body every single day, and i’ll google my odds and end up reading survivor or grief stories until i’m spiraling. sometimes in the middle of a gathering i’ll secretly check my pants or lift my shirt to look for stains, and it’s starting to get embarrassing for my family.

i guess i just want to know if anyone else has gone through this specific kind of health anxiety, 
especially about C, and how you managed to break the checking cycle. i’m tired of living like this.
i read reddit stories about people getting diagnosed and it makes my anxiety skyrocket. i always end up looking at celebs or influencers who have the c word and thinking “that could be me.” sometimes i’ll want to pull up my old cbc results and overanalyze every number, or even go on chatgpt to try and calculate my “odds” based on symptoms.

i want to live a long life — like at least to 85 — but in my head i’m always thinking my time is already running out. every little sensation in my body becomes a threat. sometimes my anxiety itself causes things like gas, stomach pains, or tingling, and then i spiral because i think it’s proof.",1754920036.0,1,1,Anxiety,anxiety

Today i saw that sick cat which means he wasn't rabid js sick. My anxiety have been to the roof for those weeks and js when i think it's gone the next day it's 10x worse, yesterday i was like the dog was not rabid but what if a bat came in my room and bit me while i was asleep bc i had those 2 marks the one is faded now they had around 3mm gap between each other, even tho i didn't woke up to bat that night the window was open. Yesterday i became hyper aware of my body even the same arm i had the dots and bite i felt like i couldn't move my pinky i got super anxious once again. For the last several days I've been feeling a bit off weakness, nausea, heart beat like crazy ( starts the second i stand from bed when i woke up) and for the heart beat my usual ones around 60 bpm now sitting is 90 bpm and standing goes over 100-117 bpm i have pretty annoying headache, sore throat going for week and a half, dry cough and stomach tenderness? I think that went away. Rabies in my country is pretty rare.

1mnbo6t,Is my anxiety and what fuels it even valid? Am I just losing my mind?,"Out of personal interest, I recently got an assessment done by a criminal psychologist. One of the few diagnoses I received was Generalized Anxiety Disorder. When we reviewed the results, I realized my recent life events have really, really, really maxed it out to the brink — and I never even understood I was experiencing anxiety the whole time. I thought maybe I was just “tripping balls,” I feel like no one around me truly understands my anxiety.

Within the past month, I experienced my first ever disabling injury. (I’m 95% recovered now) 

It happened on a day that felt happy and calm — one of those days where you couldn’t possibly imagine anything going wrong — and yet it did. I’ve always been a cautious person. I grew up in an environment where people around me were often paranoid and anxious about all sorts of things. It didn’t help that one of my primary caregivers suffered from a violence-related disorder, which I suppose fuels my anxiety.

aiming for a forensic criminal psychology career, I’m constantly exposed to disturbing information and news. I don’t feel much in the moment, but it still skews my mind. For me, it’s always “better safe than sorry.” For example, a while ago I was sitting in my friend’s unlocked car in a parking lot when a mutual friend suddenly yanked the door open, scaring us both. It taught me that if it wasn’t our friend, it could have been someone with bad intentions — to harm, abduct, or rob me. Ever since, I’ve developed a habit of locking my car within 0.1 seconds of entering.

Then, just two days ago, I got into my FIRST ever parking lot conflict — with two teenagers. They claimed I stole their spot in a very busy lot, though I disagreed. Because I refused to give up the space and rolled up my window, one of them brought over her friend and began aggressively knocking and banging on my window. I know how impulsive and self-centered teenagers can be, and I had no idea if they were armed. California has a high gun violence rate, and I partially grew up overseas where I never had to think about this, so my anxiety around firearms here is worse.

They hurled insults at me for 13 minutes, even after another spot opened right next to us. They were saying things about how rude I was and how I’m not “special” for “stealing the spot”, rolling up my window and refusing to give them the spot. 

People usually say that when they’re anxious about how something might escalate, they just apologize and drive somewhere else. But maybe I have some sort of delayed anxiety response where I don’t feel the panic instantly — instead, I stay calm and think logically, even when I’m in distress. I felt no reason to move since I had safely entered the spot first. Their car was extremely close to the space, yet they didn’t drive in within the first four seconds after it opened. I was further away, driving at the average slow speed for a packed lot, and still made it in before them. 

That’s really the core of why they were so angry — because I didn’t see it their way and rolled up my window. Their reaction escalated into aggressive knocking, banging, and throwing insults for 13 straight minutes, trying to force me to move. It made me feel like if they were willing to “crash out” over a parking spot, it was plausible they could have pulled out a firearm. My fear wasn’t about the argument itself — it was about whether they were armed and if I could survive if they decided to shoot while blocking my door. (I also tried to buy 60 seconds to make a phone call to 911 because I felt unsafe (I did not say 911 out loud), but one of the teens prevented me and I was also worried what would happen if I went against?)

(I also decided to post about all the details on two Reddit forums. Commenters on one forum totally understood me and supported me. The other forum felt I was immature, in the wrong, and needed more parking practice — which doesn’t ease my anxiety. It makes me feel like somehow the harassment I endured was justified.) 

However, the law enforcement involved in the end said the parking space itself was just a matter of courtesy, no one is truly entitled to it, and such conflicts happen all the time. But they did confirm that harassing someone and making them feel unsafe is wrong, and I have every right to call 911.

Everyone tells me to just forget about it, that parking disputes happen all the time and the other people probably aren’t thinking about it anymore. 

But to me, the fact that they were willing to escalate over something so small makes it feel entirely possible that they could have gone further — and that possibility is what keeps looping in my head.

All these things that have happened lately have pushed my anxiety to the max, yet I feel like no one around me truly understands. So when I can’t let it go in my head, people just don’t get why. It makes me feel like maybe I’m actually losing my mind over something like this. Sure, I’ve seen videos on TikTok, social media, and the news of people fighting over parking spots, but I never imagined myself actually experiencing it. I’ve also seen news stories about people being killed over parking spots, which doesn’t exactly make me feel better.

1mnb4ye,"My brain stays in ""alert mode"" all the time. What is this problem?"," I can’t stop my brain from continuously checking my surroundings. This happens in multiple situations:

1. In vehicles: Even when I’m not driving, I keep scanning in every direction to make sure everything’s safe. I can do this for hours without stopping, and it leaves me mentally exhausted.

2. At home: We have monkeys in our area that sometimes destroy flower pots or jump on the solar panel. I’m the first to run out and shoo them away. Even when I’m sleeping, if there’s a noise outside, I wake up instantly and run to check.

3. In public/crowded places: I keep track of my position, my family’s position, and whoever/whatever is around us.

4. With family at home: I’m the youngest, so whenever someone needs something, they call me. I’ve developed a habit of checking every voice I hear to see if they’re calling me — sometimes I even think they are when they aren’t.

1mmxzc2,I had a panic attack yesterday.,"I went to bed around 4:30am watching a movie the night before. I slept for 6 maybe 7ish hours. I had some tea that had about 50mg of caffeine in it. I get hyper when I have caffeine, but also sometimes anxious. Not all the time, but yesterday is when it was more anxiety rather than energetic.

It was a small theater show, and I was a side character. It was more chaotic than usual, but that doesn't excuse my actions and behavior. The tearfulness and intrusive thoughts hit me when someone told me to stop doing something. My brain took that as I did something wrong and that they hated me. Total anxiety thought, and it kept repeating over and over in my head. 

When I got a chance I tried to get a sip of water from the fountain, but it was out of order. I just returned to not arise any concern. Thoughts of everyone hates me, not fitting in with the group I'm in, and feeling stupid were all in my brain. All the coping skills I learn from therapy disappear and I can't think of anything else.

When my part is done, I went outside and try to stop the tears by drinking water. I tried to distract myself by playing a game on my phone. I texted my mom that I was feeling unwell and sensitive. I blinked some tears away after they got welled up in my eyes. I could feel my heart skipping a beat every so often. I was also feeling very dissociative and out of it.

I made a decision and got in my car. I didn't tell any of the cast members I was leaving. At the time I didn't want to tell anyone how I was feeling, because I was afraid I would just breakdown right there. I was crying a lot and started to drive home. 

It was stupid to drive while I was having a crisis. A lot of intrusive thoughts were in my head on the drive home. I was about halfway when I started getting calls and texts from cast members, so I pulled off at a gas station to reply to them. 

The leader of the cast was calling me and left a voicemail. I texted him and told him everything. He was very kind with the texts he sent back. A lot of people were worried about me, and he asked me to let someone know if I'm struggling. And that I can count on everyone there to care about me.

I went inside the gas station to use the bathroom and get a pack of gum. I was nearing the end of the panic attack and I was still trembling a bit. I got a pack of gum and just stared at it for a while. In my mind I was wondering if any of this was real and if I could wake up. I got home safe and took my panic attack meds. I didn't have them with me at the time. 

I woke up today with really big puffy eyes, low energy, and feeling like shit. I played minecraft all day in my pjs. I think I'm getting depressed again. I regret my actions from yesterday and wish I could go back to change things. 

I feel awful that I stressed, worried, and disappointed my friends. I'm scared to go back and people will treat me differently. I'm afraid that they're talking about me behind their backs. I've heard them talk shit about some cast members.

1mn4l5g,Fear of eating in public/deipnophobia,"I've stumbled upon quite a few posts about people struggling to eat in certain situation due to physical anxiety symptoms that arise when trying to eat. I've been trying to find solutions for the past 4 years but I haven't really come across anything yet, so if anyone has a real solution to this it would be greatly appreciated. 

Some background: I'm 22 years old, I've had this issue since I was a kid, and have identical symptoms to what others mention in their posts; tightness in the throat, major nausea, gagging, etc. And like most of you the symptoms only occur when I go to eat out with others, usually sit down restaurants. Fast food places and more casual places don't give me as much trouble for some reason. I've done some talk therapy here and there (hasn't helped much), went to a psychiatrist who was quick to prescribe me remeron but honestly don't want to be on meds since I don't really have any issues outside of this so I quit taking remeron after a few days. 

I'm going into the workforce soon and want to make the most out of my twenties but I feel like this is holding me back a lot. Any techniques that have worked? Specific exposure therapy, anti-nausea meds, etc? Any help would be great thank you.

TL;DR: Have trouble eating out due to debilitating physical symptoms and looking for solutions outside of ""other people don't care how you are eating"".

I don’t drink, smoke, vape, use illegal substances, or consume caffeine. I go to therapy every week and am open and honest and do everything my therapist tells me to do.

I would never take myself out of the equation because I love my friends and family too much. I just need to know if there’s actually hope for someone in a situation like mine, because if there’s not, I need to grieve the life I wanted to have. ",1754875823.0,3,3,Anxiety,anxiety

I remember it clearly it was summer 2024 and i had just got out of school it was the hardest school year for me. I would just get to class do work never complete it or turn it in and then dick around for the rest of class. My life was a mess my room reeked of weed and I would pretend to not know why, it was messy, disgusting and gross. After pretending I was still an A+ student. End of year report came in and I was in shambles, my parents never really cared about my grades but for me I felt so let down. I thought I did everything I possibly could but deep down I knew it was just cheap cop out so I could continue living what I thought was the only way to cope but what I was coping from I didn’t know. I had got clean from weed, it was July 4th and I was going to hang out with a girl and watch the fireworks. When I woke up that day I felt sick much like every other day and knew I was gonna rain check but I still went and felt I did the right thing until I began almost throwing up every five minutes and called my brother to pick me up. Work was no better I would go to work pick up a shovel and knew I was not going to make the day with out becoming sick. For the first time in my life I began to deal with anxiety by myself feeling more isolated than I ever had. No drugs, no parents holding me accountable, no personal relationships. Just me and my anxiety. To this day I wake up with stomach pain and have panic attacks just going into cars even going back to school gives me nausea and shortness of breath. This is all to say for the first time in my life I will be seeking help and planning to meet with a psychiatrist and or psychologist depending on what my insurance covers(just a joke).

It makes me so uncomfortable even talking abt this and i’ve never met someone who feels the same way about this.

Does anyone have any advice for me or at least relate to this? Whenever I tell someone about this they never understand and think I’m scared of blood.

That’s the worst part of my anxiety and PTSD. The “darkness” I call it.

I worked at ABFRL (Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd) Corp for 12 years. Even though I performed well.

ABFRL Corp transferred my job from Bengaluru, India to Sabyasachi Calcutta LLP. Kolkata. Sabyasachi is the ethnic wear brand of ABFRL . They couldn't give me a fixed roll, Because after being transferred here, I understand that there was no need for manpower here. However, I was given some tasks and I carried them out responsibly. I requested for a job transfer. They didn't do that either. then put me under PIP and forced me to quit my job. 

Those who transferred my job to Sabyasachi made a mistake because there was no manpower requirement in this ABG Group company, and as a result, they took away my job using excuses.

Even that day when I was in Sabyasachi Office it was end of May 2025, My H.O.D. and H.R.B.P. closed the door for me because they are telling me to submit your resignation today and hand over the laptop, otherwise they will take drastic action that's job terminate. Even they called Security guard and asked him not to allow me to go outside. Job is not secure here. I came to sabyasachi and felt extremely humiliated. HR should also listen to the employee. There is no impartiality in HR's work.

PIP is an excuse.

1) PIP is for taking away a job. 2) PIP is for not allowing career advancement. Job promotion has been blocked.

There is no trust in this type of corporate job. If a job is taken away in the middle of a working life, it is very difficult for that employee to find another job, maybe he/she may not get another job, because there are too many candidates compared to the number of jobs in the country. And age is also a factor in getting a job. almost 2 month is over I Left the Organisation I haven't got a job yet. I am still searching job. Loss of my career. I am mentally broken.

Don't these corporates have any responsibility towards their employees ? I want to know if corporate jobs are like this, can anyone tell me?

I am 26 years old. I do lots of things since i was a child. Playing guitar, singing, dancing, learning languages etc. I always did was I was told schoolwise. Study science and math in highschool (wanted to study languages/english - which is not my first language- ), in my last year of highschool i lost my father. I did continue studying in science field since it was my dad's wish and i was young, needed sth to distract myself. Got my associate degree to be a technician in 2019. Then covid came, couldn't find a job so i decided to study english and get in the university in my city, nothing fancy, no problem in terms of money which i also had to consider since we now have less income while my mom got early reitrement. This will be last year in my major, but now got more problems. Cannot take a simple breath for goodness.. I was supposed to go take interviews just to get a job but now I have to do an obligatory internship that will take 5 years to finish (let me remind you i will be 32 by then) and it is not 100% certain that they will accept me in the government schools. Let's say i want to use my previous degree but nope, if i get my bachelor's degree i will not be able to use the other one. I am not considering getting my masters at all because all the universities that has the program i need is in bigger cities that needs lots of money... I am thinking now that I always worked - sometimes not hard but still worked my way- however i was never the best or never happy. I realized that i do not have sth that i like to do. Even my hobbies. I like to draw then get bored, sing then get bored. Have no idea if it is the curse of ADHD or sth else but i am on the edge of a crisis of being unemployed, literally have been waking up to my mom's caughs to see if she's still breathing. She is the only one i have. No siblings no father.. Just the two of us, and i seem to having a huge anxiety over her. I had big dreams teaching English in a foreign country maybe thailand maybe japan, traveling the world.. I had an opprtunity to travel and study in europe for free with a funding, aannd i cancelled my plane tickets the day before of my flight because i had been trying to force myself to sleep while trying to breath. It was the first time that i got these symptoms. I feel like i am falling down from somewhere high and all my internal organs are shifting, cannot breath properly, having elevated heartbeat. After refusing the travel opprtunity i was going well but then it started to happen when i watch tv, like how can one get these ""attacks"" while watching brookly99 and just by thinking ""cool job"" and then it got more frequent and happened even when there was nothing happening. Visited the hospital and the only thing the doctor did was telling me it was anxiety and prescribed me with meds... and it was in february/march, after feeling like i do not get random feelings like that i didn't visit the doctor again. I had problems after that again but none of them made me like this again until today. I was always told that I was not the best and I could do better if i worked harder, like all my teachers in my life said this to my family before. I always wanted to end up somewhere good, where my dad and mom could feel proud, but i end up crawling in my mess and failure. Wanted to be ""someone"".. I do not even know who is ""me"" anymore. 



 I do not know if I am disregarding any rules or if this story belongs here or not but i saw the anxiety and just wrote whatever was pent-up in my mind. I do not expect anything. Just knowing that I wrote this down to a place where I am not the only one to see is enough to make me feel heard...

Iv been single for quite some time and that was the first date in a long time. I don’t have much dating experience to begin with. 

To stay on topic. Why am I like this and what can I do to get out of my own way? I find it interesting that something like that can make me spiral. I’m a thrill seeker and some of the things I find fun have actual risks. 

Thanks! ",1754877355.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

This almost brought me to a breaking point recently which is why I am recently sober. Sometimes I'll have great days where I feel so good it's almost to the point where it's suspicious to my subconscious, like almost a thought goes through my head like ""this isn't normal, why don't I feel like an anxious wreck?"" , and then other days, I have almost crippling waves of anxiety and depression so hard I can barely leave the house, or drive simply from point A to point B. I've had the disassociation feelings, the intrusive thoughts, basically all of it.  At this point I've learned how to manage it in a sense, but I really made this post just to see everyone else's perspective and how they handle their extreme waves of feelings with this, and just some positive words of encouragement.

1mmzwnk,Can I fix that I've conditioned myself to have heart palpitations and feel anxious when I focus on my breathing?,"So first let me say that the anxiety i experience is virtually gone entirely. I went from going days without sleeping as a nervous wreck to being a pretty normal functioning person who doesn't spiral out of control at the drop of a hat. 

When first started experiencing severe anxiety about 4 years ago I would do breathing exercises to try to control it. But then breathing exercises started being associated with anxiety itself and they would make me feel more anxious. I've since learned this is not abnormal for highly anxious people. 

Now, about 4 years later, I cannot even focus on my breathing without discomfort and heart palpitations. It's like I've conditioned myself to feel anxious by doing this. I guess this would be called respondent conditioning (like Pavlov's dogs)

I had a few panic attacks a few months ago 

My anti depressants were to high recently so I had my dosage lowered around 2  weeks ago and just started going back to a pill to help with ocd (4 days in,)

Im getting nervous and angst (and sometimes angry) around things that resemble normalcy such as a calm and quiet neighborhood or simple looking living rooms or offices. I am very aware of my thoughts, kind of feels like i am living in a hospital and I got a vr headset put on me to force positive notions on me. it doesn't help that I have adhd. I start to feel better when I constantly talk about it to myself but I don't want to keep doing that I have a life to live. Even when I feel better im still at constant unease

So after sooooo much research and videos. The most common thing I see is mindfulness. I am not my thoughts. What sucks tho is when I ruminating on that my legs feel light my stomach sink and I second guess, I don't believe it. Like I am a lost broken hope or there is some piece of the puzzle I haven't figured out yet. 

The last thing is if I do try to be mindful and focus on the present as best as I can. I tend to have some good moments. But sometimes im aware of how happy i am or sometimes i will space out from what im doing and my body and brain react in mild fear to absolute terror. To the point where i get scared of existing. like what im doing is a lie, a filtered activity and that what im doing is just putting the wool over my eyes. Even now all i have right now is doubt and second guessing. I wish I was ignorant to what I have been experiencing because this new personality that has entered my brain is making me feel like the person I was before is fake.

1mmzmpd,"Panic attacks started after one bad episode, now constant anxiety and health fears","A few months ago, I went from having a long period of rest at home (about 2 years) to suddenly working full-time again. It was a big change in pace and I wasn’t sleeping well at all, sometimes only 3 or 4 hours a night. Then we had a heatwave, and I was already feeling exhausted.

One day, during the heatwave, I was in the metro on my way home and I suddenly started feeling really bad heart racing like never before, trembling so hard, feeling like I was going to pass out or die. Someone called emergency services, and they told me it was a panic attack.

Since that day, I’ve been having panic attacks regularly. I’ve also developed severe health anxiety. I started monitoring my blood pressure for the first time in my life and saw a reading of 14 (140 systolic). People’s comments about it being “high” scared me even more. Now I’m hyper-focused on every little physical sensation, constantly checking and monitoring, and this seems to make me feel worse.

I understand now that the first panic attack was probably triggered by exhaustion, heat, and stress. But since then, my brain seems stuck in “alert” mode. I’ve started avoiding going outside or taking public transport because I’m scared it will happen again.

1mmuhrh,Is this relatable?,"A lot of people describe anxiety as big bursts of emotion that can have triggers but also comes and goes as it pleases. I just feel like a lot of people who suffer from anxiety have a ‘normal’ mode that is their default. Personally, I find that my anxiety is more… embedded into my personality? I’m really avoidant, often seeking out excuses to stay home or excuses to come home if I’m outside. Little things can set me over the edge, and I find that being in public/around people creates too many variables I need to account for. Somebody who’s accompanying me being loud or somebody acting in a way that I register as them disliking me can cause me to emotionally spiral. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember, and I think I’ll always be this way. 
I’ve never had a panic attack, I’ve never been so overcome by emotion that I show it externally. When I’m triggered I feel really ‘tight’, particularly in my head and face, and it’s like a dull ache all over my body. I feel nauseous and a bit numb, and sometimes I even get spots in my vision. It really feels like my brain is punishing me for trying. The only thing that reliably gets me out of this state is doom scrolling social media to distract me.

1mmxmce,Recently been having a problem where I keep focusing on my stomach hurting and it’s causing me to spiral and feel sick/nauseous all the time,"So for the last 2-3 months I have noticed a new problem with my anxiety. 

Anytime I have something to do whether it’s flying, going for a car ride, going out to dinner, talking to someone new, etc. I will notice my stomach feels a little off and when I first notice that there is seemingly nothing I can do to distract myself from it and I will spiral and convince myself I’m going to projectile vomit on whatever/whoever I’m around. To this point I never have thrown up from anxiety or anything like that but I’ll just be sitting there, notice my stomach feels off (say for example It rumbles cause I’m hungry) then I just keep focusing on my stomach and then I keep thinking “oh I hope I’m not getting sick” then I’ll start sweating, and feeling sick and then I full on panic and think I’m gonna throw up and be a mess until something else finally comes along to distract me.

The problem is, I usually distract myself from these feelings by physically removing myself from the area or finding something else to do. When I’m in places I can’t do either of those (sitting on a plane, sitting at my office, at a restaurant with others) I don’t know what to do or how to handle it. It’s beginning to give me agoraphobia where I don’t want to leave my house for fear I’ll be sick everywhere. Does anyone have some advice or suggestions for me?

This never used to be a problem for me until around 2-3 months ago. Went to my Dr. and got bloodwork done, everything is good, got checked for an ulcer, everything is good. 

Anyone have some medication suggestions I could ask my doctor about taking before flights/long drives that help to just calm you down drastically and quickly?

17F GAD and have had chronic awful anxiety my whole life but got really bad my freshman year and it made me have a lot of SI (never told my NP or parents this) and I got medicated with fluoxetine 20mg the summer going into my sophomore year. Things got so much better. I finally felt as though I got function like a normal person and it’s truly why I’m still alive it helped me understand what kind of thinking helps me not be anxiety and the healthy habits of a person who function normal without that debilitating sense of doom and crying and worried about literally anything and everything. Junior year was good and I fell off taking my medication just because I didn’t need it! I feel like that was a win I could go months without using but then I would have something anxiety inducing and either 1) take my medication again or 2) just suffer through it because taking it again in that moment wouldn’t do anything since Prozac takes weeks to build up in the system. I wanted to change to a medication as needed and just got prescribed Buspar 5mg 2x ONLY AS NEEDED. I did some research and it said usually buspar is only prescribed/works when taken everyday over a long period of time. And I’ve taken it a couple times since I was prescribed but it does nothing to me. I’ve also started to take my Prozac again literally right after I asked my NP to get off of it.

1mmo7sk,Did I jump the gun by stopping Lexapro when everything was going okay-ish?,"Long Background info: I've been taking 20mg of Lexapro for the past two years, and busiprone with it daily maybe for the last year or so. I've struggled with intense sweating no matter the termperature/level of exertion, which I have mostly gotten used to although its so uncomfy, but this summer wanted to stop taking my SSRIs so that I could potentially stop sweating so much and finally go to the gym and work on my poor body image. Once getting back from college, I also had a harder time getting back into a routine of remembering to take them daily-this is something I have never struggled with, but started to even with my birth control.

I truly feel starting antidepressants has majorly improved my life. I started talking in class more, got better grades, and started my work on campaigns, as well as did a lot of public speaking throughout my last internship-something I could have never imagined myself doing before. (Propanolol helps, and I will still take this before major public speaking). I stopped taking Lexapro at the beginning of July. Soon after I found out some heartbreaking news about my boyfriend and was concerned I had stopped taking it, but I was overall fine within the next few days aside from some moodiness. My aunt then passed away mid July, and again I found myself emotional, but hard to tell if it was more so since I just stopped taking Lexapro.

Now it is August, and I find myself getting depressed, as if I didn't realize how much the Lexapro was boosting my happiness levels, not just lowering my anxiety. I started working full time for my spring internship, and am concerned that I think I have imposter syndrome- but am really just an actual imposter. I have been depressed before (never for extended periods of time) and know the heaviness, and am really hoping I did not just fuck myself. My psych had mentioned stopping SSRIs the month before I did, because everything was going relatively well for me. Did I NEED them to be doing well?

I am afraid that I did, and also afriad that I am self sabotaging being off them now and staying successful by having that thought. I am wondering how the process of stopping taking Lexapro for anxiety went for others and open to advice and questions. Sorry for my word vomit!",1754846209.0,3,3,Anxiety,anxiety
1mmrk61,Anyone have a similar situation with sertraline?,"I (35 F) was recently diagnosed with ADHD and GAD. My anxiety has always been relatively manageable and more annoying than anything. 

I went to my doctor to talk about medication for ADHD, but she recommended I treat my anxiety (even though it was fine) first. She prescribed me 25mg Sertraline to start. I took it for 4 days with moderate side effects, but on day 5 my anxiety got so bad, I had shortness of breath and basically could not function. I went to the walk-in clinic and the doctor told me to take a break and decide if I wanted to go back on. 

 It’s been over 3 weeks now and my anxiety is still unreasonably high (I can’t do anything by myself, can’t run without a panic attack, can barely clean my house, I’m always a hair away from panicking).

1mmwy34,(TW: brief gore descriptions) overcoming my panic when watching tv shows?,"i am severely anxious when it comes to movies, anime and TV shows that contain blood, violence and especially gore. whenever i see copious amounts of blood in a show (animated is oddly more disturbing to me), or mutiliation, or dismemberment, i am caught in a panic and i feel like i can't rationalize it. i'm just frozen in fear. i think it's because i've become a very anxious person in general, i get intrusive thoughts, flashes of violent images in my mind all the time. and its also due to some trauma and things people have done to me, and also seeing some scary images in shows when i was younger.  
  
 it wouldn't matter much to me except i love shows, and i love anime. i love art and i love storytelling. and although there are certain shows i wouldn't touch with a 39 and a half foot pole, i don't want to panic whenever there's a violent image on screen. i've tried soldiering through, but my panic becomes so overwhelming to the point that i can't rationalize myself and can't be comforted by the fact that ""it's just a show"".

i guess i'm asking for help or advice on how to overcome this panic. not saying i even want to watch mega gory shows because i've never much enjoyed those anyways, but just action shows that tend to have blood or violence here and there.

One evening, I experienced the familiar knot in my stomach and the growing anxiety.  Usually, I would simply prepare for the wave.  However, I blurted out, ""I'm safe right now,"" without giving it any thought.
 And there was never a wave.

i'm at work and had to jot down a few of my physical symptoms that i'm going to discuss with my psychiatrist next week. those symptoms include tension in my body (specifically near my elbows and arms), temples hurt, and my mind racing so fast i can't remember previous thoughts (i was researching my symptoms and my mind kept thinking about different possibilities). i don't have anyone around me that has experience with sertraline and adhd, so this was the best place i could think to turn to.

i've never been diagnosed with adhd, but i (stupidly) agreed to take a friend's adderall (15mg) at work about 3 years ago and i felt like i was being driven by a motor in a good way. i was extremely productive and the only negative side effect was my body aching once i stopped running around. that was the one and only time i ever took any sort of adhd medication, but i've been on sertraline for a couple of days now and i feel like the symptoms are very very similar. i'm currently exploring adhd testing with my psychiatrist as well,  so i will get an answer in due time.

1mmq3lm,Not anxious but experiencing same physical symptoms? Genuine advice needed thanks,"I’m not really an anxious person, nor have I been diagnosed with anxiety or depression. But recently I’ve started experiencing symptoms similar to what i’ve seen described as anxiety or panic attacks. Is this a coincidence?

I had registered for my college classes a couple days ago, the situation was pretty stressful, but not more than it usually is. An hour or two later, I went out to lunch with my girlfriend, but began getting serious chest pain shortly after we got food. We had to leave early and I rushed back home to lie down. I started feeling slightly nauseous on the drive back. 
This chest pain was unbearable, lying down made it worse so I sat slightly elevated. The pain spread to my back and i was having difficulty breathing. It felt like a weight on my chest to the point of numbness. 
It was completely out of the ordinary so it really puzzled the two of us. We at first thought it was a heart problem as the pain was so severe, but we rendered cardiac health unlikely as I’m in my 20s so I’m lower risk. Throughout the rest of the day, the chest/back pain and shortness of breath kept coming back in waves, some worse than others. 

I ignored it but this continued to the next day. I went on with my day as usual, pausing if another wave came by. I thought I was okay until I tried to sleep that night. I got this unbearable pain in my arms that kept me up until 3am. I felt completely restless, like i needed to stretch my arms but i couldn’t stretch to relax my muscles. I started losing feeling in my fingertips. I only fell asleep when i got so tired that i slept through the muscle pain. When i woke up i was fine. 

I’m writing this because I’m experiencing pain again. My arm muscles are aching and my fingertips and getting numb. My back aches and my chest has that same feeling of a weight on it. It’s fairly bearable at the moment, but this is the first time I’m experiencing arm and chest pain at the same time. My hands are beginning to shake and my hearing is beginning to be muffled. I can think clearly and my emotions are straight, it’s truly just physical symptoms. 

A quick google search and it all said anxiety and panic attacks can cause these symptoms. Another thing to note is that this all started after my clsss registration. I’m generally unhappy with my major so I don’t really look forward to my classes, and my school infamous for a crazy workload. Many of my peers have awful mental and physical due to the demands of our school. 

My main question: Am I experiencing anxiety attacks? Again, this all started after my school registration. Is this similar to what those diagnosed with anxiety experience?

Emotional triggers I used to see through now get me. Whenever I talk to someone, I sometimes can't listen to what they say because I'm studying their faces for signs of threat.

1mmouk4,My best friend has really bad anxiety and I’m staring to feel drained because of it,"
My best friend (23F) has struggled with really bad anxiety since she was 16. In the last four years since high school, she hasn’t done anything on her own, literally nothing. She can’t even go to the supermarket alone, she always needs someone with her and has never tried going by herself, out of fear of having a panic attack.

I try to understand her, especially since I also suffered from anxiety in my teenage years. I’ve always offered to practice with her, but she’s never taken me up on it. She has also never reached out for professional help, saying that “they don’t do anything.”

The problem is, she lives quite far from me. I always take the train to her, which is an hour and a half each way and she has visited me only 2 times in those 4 years. I’ve reached a point where I feel that if I didn’t make the trip, we simply wouldn’t see each other in person anymore.

I understand that going out is challenging for her and I don’t hold her anxiety against her. But the principle of it bothers me. I don’t expect her to suddenly get better and visit me weekly, but I wish she would at least try once in a while. It’s always assumed that I’ll go to her place (she’s never thanked me for it and never offered to come to me.)

It feels like she doesn’t really see me or consider what I want to do. It’s always about her anxiety, her comfort zone, and her preferences. When we make plans, I always have to take her feelings into account and choose activities that won’t overwhelm her, but she never asks what I feel comfortable doing.

I don’t want to call her inherently selfish, but it feels like her anxiety and comfort level overshadow any awareness of other people’s needs or feelings.

For me, friendship means showing up for each other, even when you’re not 100% comfortable. I’m not asking her to go partying or suddenly do everything at once, because I know that would be overwhelming. She also knows that if she ever had an anxiety attack while we were out, I would leave with her immediately, her well-being would be my top priority in that moment.

Still, it’s been extremely frustrating, especially in the past few months. I’ve thought about stopping my visits and leaving the choice to see me in her hands. But I worry that might be cruel, since her anxiety is something she didn’t choose.

I’m just tired of always compromising for her when I never get anything in return.


I’ve tried talking to her about my feelings, but she always shuts down emotionally and says that, because of her anxiety, she can’t handle it and that she can’t go out. 

So, do you have any advice or suggestions?

1mmtdnz,Psychological ED/general bedroom anxiety,"Hi all,

So I've just celebrated by 7th anniversary with my wife, although I have some issues, particularly in the bedroom. I could do with some advice. This may branch out further than bedroom related issues, but bear with me!

To give you a bit of a back story to begin with, we were trying for a baby back around 2020/2021. However I developed issues with getting/staying hard, and ever since it's sort of knocked my confidence ever since.

I tried therapy a while ago and the advice I was given was to basically concentrate more on foreplay etc and worry less about what my penis is doing. It seemed to work for a while, but the other half had a stressful job at the time and it got to a point where we went a year without sex.

She's now got a new job which has made her a lot hornier so we've been doing/attempting to do it more, but there's still a few issues staying hard more than anything, and in general I've been trying to rush into penetrative sex so the whole experience is this anxiety filled mess. As a result I rarely instigate sex, and I'd like that to change. I think despite what the therapist taught me, I still deep into my conscience want to use my penis as soon as it's hard in case it goes soft again.

We had a chat about it tonight. She's frustrated a bit because of my general anxiety and said that the last thing she wants to do is to get her 'urges' fulfilled elsewhere. I explained that I often have issues with self esteem. A lot of the time I feel like I'm not good enough, and not being able to stay hard for my wife makes me feel bad. So I'd say the general worthless feeling/anxious of failure goes beyond the bedroom. I struggle with meeting people. I struggle to hold conversations because I'm constantly thinking what if we run out of things to say.

Another issue I have is my relationship with porn. I'll either watch it too much and then blame that for my bedroom issues because PIED, or I'll then go cold turkey and just have no urges at all. I just want to have a healthy relationship with porn, but I don't know what that looks like.

So I basically said to the wife I don't want to be this version of me. I don't want sympathy or reassurance, I know that would end up being exhausting to someone. I just want to have a normal like where I'm a more confident version of myself, and can have a normal sex life.

I've looked into using the Mojo app as a possible option, anyone used it before? Also, any other advice would be great. Even now with the prospect of getting help, I still have this nagging voice in the back of my head saying 'what if it doesn't work'?",1754858145.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1mmt7zu,Stopped Lexapro after 9 years — anxiety symptoms creeping back. How do you cope without meds?,"
Hi everyone,

I’ve been on and off a low dose of Lexapro for about 9 years. Every time I stop, I eventually slip back into anxiety and end up restarting. This February, I tapered off again and was really hoping to stay off for good.

A few weeks ago, symptoms started showing up: dizziness, headaches/pressure, low blood pressure, random heart racing, chest tightness, yawning because it feels like I can’t get enough air, nausea, stomach aches, and tense back muscles.

Social situations are the hardest — I feel trapped and just want to leave immediately. My bloodwork is normal, but my anxiety brain is convinced something’s wrong.

I’m 26 and I don’t want to be dependent on Lexapro forever. I’ve tried therapy, meditation, breathing exercises, EMDR, reading, magnesium, CBD, microdosing, valerian, St. John’s wort…

If you’ve managed to cope with anxiety after stopping SSRIs, what helped you the most? Any unconventional but effective tips are welcome. I just want to feel like myself again.

Thanks in advance ❤️

I have this chronic feeling that my family is going to abandon me, and have spent an anomalous amount of time trying to prevent it in some wholly unspecific way. I get episodes of intense paranoia, often experiencing delusions like a doll my sister brought home is going to kill my family, or that reading a bunch of gibberish will somehow invoke a curse that will corrupt and destroy my family. These delusions can be dispelled fairly easily but sometimes they are too intense to get rid of easily. I experience minor hallucinations, like black shapes in the corner of my vision, but nothing intense or potentially harmful. am hyper-vigilant, careful to never be an inconvenience or to argue, since I know that arguments only ever make people hate each other and I don't want people to hate me. I have made hundreds of posts on Reddit, desperate to figure out what's wrong with me so I can fix it and be happy. I sometimes experience deep fears when someone is upset, scared that they will snap and hurt people like this was their last straw. I have this foreboding sense that my entire life is waiting to collapse, every day is just another tick of the clock towards the 12th hour. When people are upset with me, I feel a deep terror like I've opened Pandora's Box and will try to apologise and be ashamed - anything to stop them from leaving me. When I hear something scary that could affect me, I have to sit in my room for an hour, terrified, before my brain will finally calm down and I can cope with the thoughts rationally. I have this sense that I have to become better. No action is good enough if it doesn't push me forward, I have to improve otherwise my family will see me for the failure I am and they will leave me. 

This is almost all of my anxiety summarised. As I said, I've never been diagnosed or treated for any sort of anxiety disorder, but I'm wondering if it might be worth it. What do you think? Should I get treatment? Does this sound like severe anxiety?",1754856868.0,1,1,Anxiety,anxiety

1mms7ys,Severe stabbing pains in my chest and back,"Three days ago, I started getting severe stabbing pains in the left side of my chest and back that would last a few seconds, go away and come back. A few hours later, I started to freak out because I was crying in pain and ended up going to A&E in an ambulance. The hospital did an ECG and a blood test and said they don't show any signs of heart problems. I asked them if they could do further tests on my heart like an echocardiogram and they said no because they're not concerned. They said it is likely gastro related so they have prescribed me omeprazole. I was still in severe pain after 12 hours so they gave me one tramadol tablet which helped immensely, but unfortunately refused to give me more to take home. Three days later, I am still experiencing severe pain, less frequent but still severe. I don't know what to do because I don't see how a gastro problem could be causing me to experience this much chest and back pain. I'm really scared that I have heart disease. I'm also struggling to eat because I feel like the pain gets worse after I eat. I'm going to get severely malnoursished if this carries on because I'm already underweight.

1mms5nu,I really thought this was just how life would be now…,"I wanted to share something that I would’ve needed to hear a few years ago, in case it helps even one person feel less alone.

There was a point where I fully believed *this was just it* — panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, constant dread. I wasn’t experiencing joy anymore. I was obsessing over every weird physical symptom, convinced something terrible was happening to me. I couldn't even drive without the fear of not making it home.

I tried everything they said would help — CBT, counselling, medication, changing my diet, exercising. I was “doing all the right things,” but I still felt like I was constantly fighting something invisible and exhausting. Like I was empty and full at the same time.

Then, I stumbled across somatic therapy. I had no idea what it even was — but from the first masterclass I watched, it felt like someone had finally *explained me* to me. The symptoms, the fear, the tension — suddenly it all made sense. For the first time, I didn’t feel broken. I just needed to understand what my body was holding.

That was the start of everything changing for me. Not managing or coping anymore — actually *healing*. Feeling joy again. Driving again. Being present with my kids, my family, my life.

The biggest realisation I’ve had is this: my body always held the tools to heal — it just needed the chance to release everything it had been carrying. Most of what I tried before was focused on the mind, but everything I was experiencing was *being stored in the body*.

Now, a few years on, I get to support other women who feel like I did — watching them move out of fear and back into joy. Honestly, witnessing that is even more powerful than my own journey.

I don’t know if this will land with anyone reading — but if you’ve tried everything and nothing’s worked, please know that doesn’t mean you’re broken. You might just need a different approach.

(And if anyone ever wants to chat or ask questions about this kind of healing work, I’m always happy to share what helped me. No pressure, just putting it out there. ❤️I want us all to win!)",1754855291.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

It's my senior year, and I'm quite nervous about university applications and stuff like that, which is making things worse. Just thinking about the thought of being nauseous makes me anxious, which causes a loop.   
  
After going to a dental appointment last week, the nausea started, and it's not going away. I wake up nauseous and am barely able to eat without gagging, but I never throw up. It gets better throughout the day, but it's been more than a week, and I'm absolutely petrified it will last until school starts.

1mmq1ot,My school is responsible for my anxiety. Primarily for this one assignment. (Vent/Rant),"I’m in college now, but I still remember my high school experience. And I would never wish it upon my worst enemy.

I didn’t go to a normal public school. I went to a K-12 preparatory school. I’m going to describe it as a public school that tries so hard to be better than everyone else. There isn’t as much bullying which is nice, but honestly, to say I am grateful I went to this school would be a lie. I’ve always had some bad anxiety, (I was on Prozac for some time) but It gave me a lot of anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, etc. and there were ALOT of issues that lead me to my anxiety but the worst thing about this school is their “capstone” assignment.

It’s called the senior thesis. It’s a 15 page paper. You’re basically given two “classic texts” (this is a classical education) and have to read them over summer. Then you have to make a philosophical essay and then you’re hooked up with a teacher advisor to help you. And THEN, you have to do an hour long speech where you have to dress up and then answer questions in front of a panel of teachers and an audience.

They believe it’s a massive privilege to do such a great project (all this showed me was they’re unnecessarily elite). Oh but goodie it gets better. This project follows humane letters class/cirriculum. (HL is basically English that makes you seminar for 2 hours). But they want to REALLY force students to do this project. So rather than making it an assignment in HL class, they made it a WHOLE CLASS ON YOUR TRANSCRIPT!

No joke, they literally made it a .25 credit assignment, so if you fail, you can’t graduate. Yes. A 15 page paper and oral defense depends on your graduation. Now you could redo it, but I don’t think a paper should be dependent on your graduation. During the writing time they wouldn’t let us use computers! And the senior thesis director was an AH. He yelled at my classmates over something that wasn’t our fault, and gave us a rubric the day before the first draft was due.

For a 17 year old with horrible social anxiety, this SCARED me. I already didn’t go to a friends house all throughout HS cause my anxiety was so bad. Now I had to do this! I already hated reading. Now I had to do a speech and basically a debate in philosophy in front of my teachers and an audience.

Absolutely the f not. Idk if I was technically allowed to do this, but I wasn’t about to FULLY lose my sanity over this nonsense. I moved my defense date to an earlier one to get it done, and basically locked down the classroom. I pretty much uninvited everyone (including my parents since it made me nervous so I recorded it for them) and only invited in two of my closest friends. (The teacher panel was fine with it)

Typically after everyone finishes the defense, they celebrate and socialize with others. Me? As soon as they said congratulations, I left the room, said bye to my friends, ran into the bathroom to change into my work clothes, and went into my shift at Starbucks. A job and something that truly brings me joy.

This probably sounds like something stupid to be upset about, but that assignment hurt my mental health a lot. I was giving a speech about books I really didn’t understand and I didn’t feel like myself. Counted down the seconds it was over.

Why are we forcing teenagers to do this?!? Most schools don’t make students do this. This school claims to be a college prep school, but my college is nothing like this. When I went to college, I couldn’t believe how much better it was.

There have been other students that have had panic attacks and people have left the school cause of this assignment. And while my grade all of us got thru, there have been students that couldn’t walk because of a dumb defense. I’ve even read some stuff in the handbook about it and it all seemed so STUPID

Either way, this school was no very accommodating to students with anxiety. I’m in college now and my anxiety isn’t nearly as bad, but I still have panic attacks and don’t socialize almost ever.",1754850435.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety

1mmpkiv,The dentist gives me extreme anxiety.,"I have really bad anxiety, so going to the dentist has always been a rocky road for me. I could always manage to push myself to go anyways, though. 

Back in October of 2023, I had a dentist appointment and was on edge during my appointment (like usual), and the dental hygienist was cleaning my teeth with the metal hook scraper tool they use. She scratched my gums multiple times until I told her “please stop using that tool, it hurts real bad” she had brushed me off and told me to sit back and relax, then continued using the tool.

At this point I was very uncomfortable and starting to shake. She scratched my gums again, though on accident, and I guess I just really started to freak out and snapped on her. I was shaking uncontrollably and grabbed her wrist so hard that it made her drop the tool and pushed her off of me and got up and frantically ran out and  left the building.

I was so embarrassed and when I left I ran straight to my care and started crying so hard I blacked out. They tried calling me multiple times and left voicemails, but I am too scared to answer or listen to them. I haven’t been back since then, and have been having really bad tooth pain, so I think I need to work something out because the pain is really bad and it’s only getting worse.

I then went on Citalopram and took that until around a month ago. The last 6 months have been horrific for me and I knew the Citalopram wasn’t working for me anymore so I went to the doctor and asked to go on Paroxetine because I’ve heard it’s good for anxiety and PMDD (which I also have). My GP said they don’t prescribe it but couldn’t tell me why and made me try sertraline again. I feel terrible and I cannot leave the house without having a panic attack. 
I can’t go on beta blockers because I am asthmatic and I know that benzos can’t be used long term. It seems that ssri’s are the only thing they offer but clearly that isn’t working for me. I know other countries prescribe Buspirone? Has anybody been able to get that on the NHS?

Resently life got extremely stressful and I started having anxiety attacks they are not so bad but it's one more thing to the table that I can't really deal with right now and I need a time off from all the anxiety. 

This is my journey of starting antidepressants, I have used antidepressants before so I know it's aways a happy ending. 

Im making this so I can remember the process and maybe help someone out there and to know what to expect.

Day 1. (12h shift at work) I went to my doctor to prescribe me esobel and I started taking it the same day it's 10mg tablets she told me to start with 5mg for the first 10 days and then increase it to 10mg. I told her that 10mg is too much for me in my past experience I was almost like braindead so I want to take 2.5 daily strikes the perfect Ballance for me. 

I took the pill 1 hour later the side effects started kicking in with anxiety like symptoms like lightheaded, unexplainable anxiety about nothing (lol) and brain zaps 👎 the side effects lasted for 2 hours and went away.

Day 2. (12h shift at work) Same as yesterday but less intensive and without brain zaps, I felt a lot calmer even tho the medication is not really working it needs atleast 14 days to start working, maybe placebo or just knowing that I did the right thing and knowing that all my anxiety will soon be gone. Felt sleepy sleepy I could spend all day in bed.

1mmeell,Anyone else? The world at night feels dark and lonely.,"Wondering if this is related to anxiety or depression, if anyone else feels this way. 

For a very long time, I’ve always felt the world at night feels like a dark and lonely place. 

While others find joy in leaving the house and going out, I view the outside world as a bit scarier, darker, lonelier at that time. It feels natural to be inside and away from the dark.  There is a melancholy out there, good things do not await. Just a big bad city (in my case). 

I feel like it is different than  ‘nighttime anxiety’ (experiencing anxiety at night). It’s more like anxiety OF the nighttime itself, or a reaction to it. 

As a consequence I rarely enjoy the idea of going out at night. I will do it if I need to.

1mml7v2,Arms and legs feel tight and weak,"Hello, my newest symptom I’ve been experiencing recently are extremely stiff and weak feeling arms and legs, mostly located in my forearms and thighs/calfs. I did my own little strength test (did some pushups and squats lol) and I was able to do a normal amount of each, but I still feel an overwhelming sense of heaviness and weakness in those muscles. I get a sharp pain that radiates from my hip down my left leg occasionally so maybe it’s something posture related or something like that? I recently went to a neurologist as well about a month or two before these symptoms started for an unrelated issue and he did a strength test on me and I was all good.

It started about when i was 11 just small things like hitting my head scared to go to sleep etc. Now i am 21 and my health anxiety causes me to worry about getting cancer, tumors, blood clots, diabetes, going blind, heart attacks, dying in my sleep, even getting Hiv which also is holding me back from being a medical assistant or nurse. I also tend to have memory issues time to time not big things like family, where i live etc. But similarly small stuff like what people told me or what i forget what i was gonna do entering a room. I one time convinced myself i had dementia but working in a nursing home showed me i indeed don’t. But every migraine i get, sharp pains, muscles spasms, even the tiny lumps on me convinced me i have 20+ different diseases. I am just tired of being a hypochondriac.

I'm in a stable long-term relationship and we are sexually active. I have been on birth control (combination pill) for 5 years now and have never had any issues. I've developed this crazy anxiety over pregnancy. Sometimes it's all I think about a day. I use my birth control properly and we minimize chance of pregnancy by pulling out as well. Still every single day I'm checking my body for symptoms of pregnancy, at every weird feeling I think I'm pregnant and get panic attacks. I don't know what to do or how to fix this. This fear of pregnancy and the anxiety it causes me is literally eating me up alive. I sometimes can't even function throughout daily life because of the anxiety. Even when I have confirmation I'm not pregnant, the next time I have sex or have a weird feeling the anxiety comes back all over again. I never want to have kids. I'm currently 22 but I genuinely feel like I will never in my life want children. My boyfriend also does not want kids at all.

1mmk68e,Is this just my anxiety talking?,"My boss recently responded to my email regarding working a hybrid position.  Currently, I am fulltime in the office.  Previously, I was asked to complete important tasks while traveling, since my boss and I are the only two who are trained in such tasks.  When she responded to my email request, she said no to working hybrid and also added that I am no longer allowed to do ANY work while traveling.  

When I received the email (since I am currently traveling), I immediately went to the work inbox and found 5-6 emails that were tagged for me to do, and tagged them for her instead, since they are time sensitive documents.  I honestly thought I was doing the right thing and felt good about it.

However, the next morning I tried to log in to check and see if more emails had come through for me, just to learn that the password had been changed around the same time that I would have re-tagged my emails for her.  I sent her a text and did not get a response. An hour or so later, she emailed me a response to my text....

She said she changed the password after she noticed I had logged in to re-tag emails for her, so ""for security reasons"" she decided it was best to change it.  I have ALWAYS had access to the work emails.  She honestly seemed a little pissy that I changed those 5 or 6 emails over for her, at the same time, I am on vaca until Thursday and clients cannot wait that long.  

I responded and said that I meant no harm in doing what I did, I was just making sure that the clients were taken care of in a timely manner.  I told her I felt that I upset her and apologized for that.  She finally responded the next day and wished me a happy birthday and said she hoped I was having a great vacation.  She ended it, ""we can connect when you're back"".  

Right when I read that part, I got this weird tunnel vision and I felt like I was slowly swaying.  For me, this is CLASSIC anxiety.  I have talked to a few people about the situation and I tell them I feel like I'm going to get fired.  They tell me they don't understand why I feel that way, as they don't believe I did anything wrong.  

So now I'm wondering...is this my anxiety talking? Or is it intuition?  And how do you differentiate the two?",1754836553.0,1,0,Anxiety,anxiety
1mmjguc,Financial Anxiety,"I don’t know why I’m posting other than to vent. 

I’m married with 2 kids. We have a constant cycle of running up CC debt and then paying it down as much as possible when I get a bonus. Every few years this cycle gets to me and I get bad anxiety/panic attacks (along with lingering depression). This year it hit me hard probably because our kids are in college too so some empty nest worry is mixed in. I ended up pulling money from retirement to wipe out all of the CC balances. That should have given me some relief but I’m still overly anxious about our money and afraid to spend a dollar. My wife has been good and taken out all the CCs from her wallet. I know the anxiety is from wanting control and to have certainty that things will be OK but it’s life and nothing can be certain. 
I just want to go back to being less anxious about things so that we can enjoy our life and I’m not scared about spending $5 on something. ",1754834767.0,1,3,Anxiety,anxiety

1mqibjg,Meds changed my life,"Not trying to necessarily tell anybody what to do, but in my own experience getting on prescription meds has truly done wonders. I used to be crazy depressed and socially anxious. I hated having to leave the house in case a stranger talked to me.  I constantly thought about how others viewed me physically and as a social person. I had been self medicating with weed for a few years but about 6 months ago i signed up with teladoc and got prescribed zoloft and wellbutrin. At first it didn’t seem to do much but one day it was like a light switched. Suddenly the words just flow from my mouth and I don’t care what others think when I talk. I didn’t have the urge to smoke anymore because i was more comfortable living in my own skin. Making friends is so much easier when you aren’t afraid to be yourself. Truly a liberating feeling. Anyways, I guess the takeaway is even if you don’t feel like doing therapy, think about talking to a psychiatrist for meds. They take a while to work, but the chance of it working for you could be worth it in the end. ",1755217660.0,17,7,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mqd3tt,Look way older than my age and it ruins social interactions,"Looking older than my age (23F) has been the biggest nightmare as someone with social anxiety. By the time I was 12, people making small talk (mainly hair stylists) asked me what college I attended. By the time I was 13, I had people asking me if I attended school (which confused me, but now looking back they were just trying to gauge if I was in college or just working). By the time I was 14, people stopped feeling comfortable making small talk with me. Hair stylists looked confused when they’d see me, probably unsure what to even ask me, because they couldn’t figure me out. I’m assuming they thought I was mid to late 20s by that point. 

Seems like the social acceptability of being shy and awkward tends to run out by the ages (or being perceived as the ages) of 23-25. As a kid, this abrupt shift from being treated normally to suddenly being treated like people were confused and/or disturbed by me was very upsetting. But now I realize they likely assumed I was a mentally delayed full grown adult rather than a shy kid. 

I just turned 23 a couple of days ago, and the treatment has only gotten worse. I thought I’d grow out of my shyness/awkwardness by now, but people currently avoid eye contact with me. When people are put in a position of having to talk to me (cashiers, hair stylists) they either talk down to me in a condescending tone or have a look of confusion. I feel like I’ve never been able to get a smooth transition while growing up to learn how to properly socialize when it feels like everyone treats me so strangely :(

I know many people complain about looking younger than their age and not being taken seriously or getting asked dumb questions but I’d take that any day over this.. I’ve tried everything to look my age. Lose weight, gain weight, grow out my hair, cut it shorter, wear more makeup, less makeup, more colorful/trendy clothes, more minimalist/neutral clothes. I’m getting more and more socially anxious every day and I don’t know what to do. When people find out my age or see my ID they always have a look of disbelief/horror for a second but then start treating me my age, it’s almost like it all clicks for them.

Because of my social anxiety, which is pretty bad, my kids miss out on so much (social event wise). My 15 year old daughter is not into athletics but my 11 year old dream has always been to be a cheerleader. She's been dancing around since she was a toddler. So today, I forced myself to take her to the cheerleading meeting at her school today. It was so many moms I felt my heart was gonna beat out of my chest. Not to mention her science teachers is one of the coaches. Long story short, the tryouts are next week and if she makes the team it's 4 days a week practice plus games and community service events plus parent participation. The parent participation is what's got me nervous.

I was just about to tell my daughter that I can't do it when she came in my room so excited and saying she can't wait to make the team.

1mqk0wa,It feels physically difficult to make facial expressions and I don't know why,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but this has been an issue that has been bothering me for a while now. I don't know if this is related to anxiety or not, but expressions feel manual, I usually feel like I have to consciously change the way my face is positioned to ""react"" to something. This is the case both with close family and strangers, although it can definitely be more difficult to express myself around those I don't know. Expressions seem to come naturally to most people, if they are happy, they will smile. If they are surprised, they will naturally assume a more alert expression. But this isn't usually the case for me. It takes some level (varying on the situation) of focus and physical effort to present myself in a way that conveys emotion. Don't get me wrong, I FEEL emotions, often very strongly, but for some reason this doesn't translate to me making the corresponding expressions for them.

When I am tired, I all but lose the ability to even force an expression, because this would use mental and physical energy I don't have at the time.

The weirdest part about it is, I often think I am making somewhat of an expression, but in reality I look so snobby and disinterested. Yes, the rbf. I didn't really notice it at first, but I started noticing on pictures and on video calls I look like the rudest person ever. If I am taking a selfie, I can adjust my features to achieve a specific expression, but if someone else is taking the picture, I honestly have an unclear idea of what my face is actually looking like at the time. It's like there is a ""link"" that is disconnected from myself internally and externally, and it is confusing and very frustrating.

To effectively make the expressions I want to, it often feels like I have to over-exaggerate myself to a cartoon-ish level, when in reality I am only then just achieving the normal and expected expression for the occasion. This makes me feel fake, like I'm putting on an act to convey myself in a certain way, one that is calculated and not genuine, and to some extent, I really am. I do feel the emotions, but my outer ""reaction"" is often quite fake.

I don't understand what is causing this, why I am like this. I don't know if it is related to anxiety or something entirely different, but it is such a chore just to effectively communicate sometimes.",1755222246.0,2,2,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mqj3o7,Never really got to socialize outside of school,"I went to a K-12 school as a kid. Stayed there all 13 years. Two different locations, but same brand of school. I only went because my mom had family members who work with the brand.

I was not close to this school. It was a 25 minute drive for the first one (with a freeway) and 15 minute drive to the second one. I couldn’t walk. It wasn’t an option and we didn’t have busses.

 There never really was a “let’s go to my house after school” since all my friends lived far away. I couldn’t just walk or bike to them. I was basically home if I wasn’t at school. Never socializing. 

And when I did get to see a friend outside of school, it had to be heavily planned ahead. It didn’t feel natural. Socializing wasn’t a habit. 

The last time I went to a friends house was in 8th grade for a sleepover. RIGHT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I even had a panic attack when I was there. Since I was locked down, I never got to socialize, and it fell more of a habit to be at home. 

Im not kidding, I have never once gone to a friends house all throughout high school or college. I finished my first year of college, and I never did anything social.

My school was not very accommodating to social anxiety either, I hated it, they made you do student-led conferences, and they made you do a speech in front of a panel that required you to graduate.

1mq45h2,Diminished Speaking Ability,"Since my childhood I have never been talkative. I met a few people at school during elementary and middle school but I completely stopped meeting people after high school started-I was in 7th grade when the pandemic hit and stayed home everyday until orientation week for high school freshmen. It has now been about 3 months since I graduated and I have made 0 friends during those school years. At school I would sit by myself in class, lunch, and bus. When I would try to speak to others they would look uninterested and never talk to new again. I thought to myself maybe I had ADHD. Looking back I should have tried meeting people that actually cared about me and not get discouraged from meeting the wrong people. I also now realized that my communication ability has diminished significantly during the pandemic and I should have kept practicing talking to others during my high school years. Not knowing what to say or respond was challenging. I remember how cringy it was trying to start a conversation and giving up from those moments during school. By senior year teachers and adults from my family told me to smile more- I guess I lost my natural smile. Please never give up 🙏.

It’s been about a month and half since I have been seeking out social interactions. My goodness, the first time I met people my eye contact was terrible and my voice/body felt stiff. It’s incredibly difficult to put myself in social situations but I know learning from these situations will only improve my abilities.   I have a lot to work on and I know this long
journey will not be easy. At first I was stressed worrying if the people I met will ignore me, but I know I tried my best and will not react negatively toward them but will try to meet other new people unlike what I did in high school.

I’m also beginning on improving my appearance along my communication. I’ll take things slowly since this isn’t a race. Currently midnight while I write this post.

Why I'm writing this is bc I'm a person who craves encouragement and understanding but feel too shy and anxious to ask. Bc at the end, I'm always feeling disappointed or belittled when I ask for such things to someone.

I have been a student who eats lunch, studies, reads, struggles and laughs alone ever since 5th grade. And at the time of being a young student (at 5th and 6th grade) I have been very insecure and lonely around my classmates and everyone.

But lately, ever since 7th grade, I have been improving and been feeling MUCH better about myself. Still a shy student who's always alone in the library that no one really bothers to talk to. Unless you come up to me asking ""hey, why are you always alone? You look sad...""

FIRST OF ALL, THATS MY FACIAL EXPRESSION. IM NOT SAD 😭😭😭

Second, thank you for worrying but please, please don't think I'm a depressed loner. I'm happy to be alone now actually.

Last weekend there was a get together at his sister's house and I started to have a bad panic attack on the way there but luckily stopped it before anyone noticed, and I went in with my ""game plan"" (""don't make any personal comments, don't stay in one place for too long, and if you end up stuck in a convo that starts to get too personal or uncomfortable, you know what to do -- find a bathroom."") I ended up being too anxious to eat anything at some point, at the time I didn't attribute the panic attack then or that/couldn't eat to the situation, but it looks like I probably should've connected the dots.

I think those questions are a little too personal, for anyone really, but am I overthinking it?? I'm seeing them again in a couple days and I'm already taking my anxiety meds I normally just take in the evening during the daytime too for the first time in years. I was fine for every family get together and function before this, and I really do love his mom bc I don't think it came from a bad place at all, but end result was the same - super uncomfortable.

1mqd286,Help am I socially awkward or do I have social anxiety???,"It's my 2nd day of highschool and I'm miserable. I have no classes with any of my friends or lunch. It's not the end of the world for me, but for some freaking reason I suck at socializing with new people. 

Since I was little I was always labeled as ""shy"" or ""quiet"", but I don't generally think of myself like that. I can get loud (when people tell me to speak up) and talk to people when I need to and don't 'fear' social interaction. I'm just super awkward. But at the same time, I'm anxious when I have to present in front of class, or when I have to do icebreakers, or having to have a conversation with someone because I can't think of anything to say. I don't fear socialization as in I'm scared to death, rather I'm super nervous of it in the way that I suck at it.

It gets so bad that I'm always tapping my feet and always avoid social interaction. I literally shut off anyone I don't or barley know and only talk to people I'm close to. How do I break out of that? It doesn't help especially since at lunch I'm all alone and I get really sad and uncomfortable.

1mpgcso,I went to the movies by myself for the first time at 26,"I love horror movies, but usually I skip out on seeing them in theater because no one I know enjoys them. So I thought to myself, ""who's going to care if I see one alone?"". So Saturday night I went, and... nothing happened. No one looked at me weird, no one stopped me- what anxiety I had when I walked in to sit down almost immediately dissipated.

For some background, as a pre-teen I was consumed by anxiety and depression. There was a point in hs where I would hide in a bathroom stall during lunch so people wouldn't see me alone. Even at 21, I was on the phone with my dad, bawling because I had to take a large amount of money out of the bank, and I was worried the teller would question me or think I was odd.

There are a lot of teenagers and young adults on here, so I thought I'd share something that I think could've made me feel a little better if I read it when I was younger. Hearing ""it gets better"" never really helps, but I hope that this little win I had last week can reach at least 1 person who needs to hear it.

1mq2mkh,I used to be fine but it's starting again,"I'm 17 years old, and since like when I was 13, i got so socially awkward with my friends that I never talked with them. I always cover my face when I'm with them. I really want to live like a normal person, like the others, but I just can't get over this. When I take my hands off, my friends always mention it: ""oh ur not covering ur face"" and I feel like they are individually picking out my insecurities.

I have acne too. It's one reason I cover my face. My face even has scars and I just hate it. I had a crush last year and got rejected quite horribly. She rejected me cuz I'm like this: I only use thumbs up and down to communicate and I act so shy -- almost like a girl. I used to be fine but I keep thinking about her too and it's annoying cuz she doesn't even care about me and here I am still suffering more than one year later.

I don't think I have ever talked with a girl my age after 13. And im scared that the rest of my life is gonna be fucked. I always dream of being loved and cuddled. But I know I can never achieved that because I'm like...well, THIS. every girl sees me as a weirdo or a creep (radiohead reference btw), and I have gotten the urge to hurt people too. I've been bullied so bad and it's like the main reason I cover my face like this. They bullied me cuz I didn't talk. Every time I'm outside with a talkative person, I always pray that they won't say something out loud about my appearance.

Well this is already getting long and i don't wish to yap enough to fill a novel, but I just wanted to open up to someone because it feels so good to write down all this and see whats what instead of just feeling all cloudy in my head. Recently my appetite has been going to shit too. Im 6'2 but my weight is going down so fast and I look so skinny. 

Please don't recommend therapy. I've tried it already and they tell me to drink some pills that do absolutely nothing. The only therapist here just doesn't even take 5 minutes with me and is so rushy. Suggest something other than therapy. I used to be happy for the past few months but it suddenly hit me again and I don't know why. I don't wanna commit suicide because Im curious to experience everything that I haven't yet experienced.

My dms are open if anyone wants to reach out. Stay safe. If you got social anxiety, just know that I got it worse xD. If ur feeling suicidal as well, u can reach out to me too, and I'll tell u why suicide is a very bad idea (from my experience)",1755182586.0,7,1,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mqfdtt,Anxious over a party I'm not even attending.,"I'm 16 and entering senior year next week. Senior year is a huge deal at my school, and there are endless 'generation' activities throughout the year. I'm not very close with most of them, even though I've attended the same school, with the same people for a decade now. 

Before the first day of class they're throwing a huge party, and it feels like everyone is attending. I do not want to go. Not because I'm too anxious or anything, but because I genuinely don't want to. I know this, and yet whenever I think about the party I get overly anxious. My heart beats faster, I lose my appetite, and I just scroll mindlessly to avoid thinking about it. It's been two days now and I can't get over it; it's stopping me from enjoying what little summer I have left. 

The anxiety stems from my brain telling me people will think I'm lame or an outcast, and I just can't shut the thoughts out. It sounds stupid, but it's immobilizing me. I'm sure in hindsight it won't seem like a big deal, but I just need tips to get by until then. Any advice?",1755210365.0,1,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

Since it was a minor procedure and based on my appointment with the main doctor, I assumed only 2-3 nurses/doctors would be there. I wasn’t too anxious because the nurses leading up to the surgery were so nice, then I (23F) get to the operating theatre and there were 8-9 people! All female except a young male medical student. 

So there I am in my humiliating hospital gown and cap, no makeup allowed so my acne is on full display, suddenly faced with a bunch of people. They were all really nice, but god was it awkward constantly hearing the rapid beeping as they monitored my heart rate. They even asked if I was okay cause I was going red and I just mumbled that I’m nervous. 

They probably assumed my racing heart was anxiety from the procedure, but I only remembered surgery meant needles, scalpels, blood in the moment and got mildly freaked out. I was almost solelyý worried about all the people around me and how to not to make a fool of myself.

1mq01se,Took a chance and feeling a bit foolish,"So, for context, I am a teacher (that may be hard to believe based on my less-than-great writing lol) who worked at a certain high school for four years, during which time I developed feelings for the school secretary, a woman ten years my senior. I think the thing that drew me to her the most was her bright, friendly personality that always left me feeling a little better every time we interacted. But, of course, the old adage of not shitting where you eat came to mind (workplace complications, the fact that I taught her daughter) and so I did not ask her out or anything of the kind. 

For more context, I will admit I have long struggled with social anxiety and do not have the best self-esteem. And I sort of think this may be partially why I developed some level of attraction to this person, as she often made me feel valued and respected (i.e., showing concern when I mentioned possibly taking a job at a new school, mentioning how much her daughter enjoys my class, telling me quite a bit about her family and personal life, etc.). 

Last week, I accepted a teaching position at a new school in a completely different district a few hours away, and so, now I feel quite foolishly, I decided to send her a short email letting her know of my move, thanking her for her help over the last few years, and suggested keeping contact if she is up to it, but no pressure, then wishing her well. That was just about a week ago, and I have not heard a sound back. 

Part of me tries to hold out hope -- I sent this to her work email (only contact I had) in mid-August, and so perhaps it has not been read yet, or some such thing. But then the other part of me feels foolish, thinking it most certainly has been read, and she has chosen not to reply, or worse, that I made her uncomfortable or mistook friendliness for more. And I know this may sound stupid, but personally, I think being told no is so much better than just radio silence, even if it is effectively the same.

I hate physics so much, and hate it even more that my teacher doesn’t know how to explain anything so I don’t even bother asking for help. I almost always want to ball my eyes out because of that class, I never look toward to any school days just because of that class. Today we were talking about some graphs and I unfortunately was sitting in the corner too sleepy to even move to the front like I usually do because I can’t see from that corner. He told us the paper was going to be a grade, and I was sitting in the corner like an idiot not paying attention. After a while I was just there basically just looking at my paper hoping class would end and hoping he was just playing about the grading part (he always says he’s going to grade something but never does until today) So my anti social self was just kinda getting overwhelmed and over stimulated. Everyone is helping eachother and I just sat there looking at other people help eachother because I didn’t wanna get up and chat. After a few minutes passed by it was almost the end of the class and I was just tryna scribble random stuff and unfortunately that didn’t work. He graded other peoples work and finally called on me since I never got up, it was the last few mins of class and I showed him my paper. He looked at me disappointed and asked me why I didn’t ask for help when he asked multiple times if anyone needed help. (He wanted us to walk to him in front the whole class so ofc I didn’t go up there) and I lowkey tried to looked confused but unfortunately i frown a lot when I’m on the edge of crying from my idiotic choices, then the words came out his mouth “are you crying?” I wasn’t but that for sure sent me to tears from embarrassment and the reminder that I can’t fully hide my insecurities of my idiotic decisions. (Also I was crying the night before so maybe he thought my puffed up face was me crying). I cried my way to my 2nd period and asked to go the counselor’s office, and even there I didn’t get the comfort I needed.

Im 21F and have decided to got back to school to get better education and today was the first day. I've been spiraling because of it for weeks now and spend the whole day yesterday doing nothing- I couldnt eat or drink, cried all day and suffered at least 2 panic attacks because I just couldnt handle the thought of attending school again- new people, a big class, doing presentations, spending most of my day there
and doing shit I swore i'd never do again (the degree I have atm isnt bad, I just dont know what to do instead of school)

That being said- I couldnt sleep the whole night, woke up after barely 2 hours with a pounding headache, stomach ache (from not being able to eat) and feeling weak af. So I decided ok, l'Il just go on monday, missing the first two days is shit but what can I do? I can barely stand, let alone exist in the heat wave we have here lately, so I wrote an email to the school and passed out again almost immidiatly.

The thing is- my anxiety and depression are pretty bad lately, idk what made me think going on monday would make it easier- it will probably be even harder since I missed all importend infos and dont even know where my classroom will be by then. Everyone else will already have meet each other and I will be the weird one again who showed up two days late and missed everything

Im scared I wont be able to go next week, that my anxiety will completely overwhelm me again and wont be strong enough again to do something about it. Im an adult and I feel 10000% pathetic for handling things like this. Its embarrassing.

I know I’ll never be ‘the life of the party’ and I’m totally ok with that. But this? This is ridiculous. It’s like I turn into a scarecrow whenever I’m in any type of social situation.

My two friends that would only talk to me once a week, gone like that. 

3 years ago, a girl I liked from my youth group started texting me out of the blue. Let me tell you, it felt amazing. I didn’t feel the pressure when I texted her. I felt like I was able to talk to someone who actually cared about me…. Until she just stopped. I felt confused, I hated myself, asking myself what I did to ruin everything…. Until she started texting me again the next year. But the same thing happened. Off and on and off and on we went for three years. All while my anxiety went spiraling downhill. She still has me in a chokehold to this day. A few months ago I even told her what I was struggling with mentally. She had some sort of camp at the time that doesn’t allow phones, and the day she got back, she checked up on me. It felt great. It felt like my honesty finally paid off, but lo and behold, she hasn’t texted me since. She’s the one person who actually knows the real me. The one person I felt comfortable enough to share, and she doesn’t even care about me enough to check-in every once in a while. I just feel so stupid


I want to talk to people. I really do, but there’s this overwhelming pressure that consumes me any time I have the chance to. I feel so alone. I don’t feel cared, loved, or acknowledged.

1mpn6n6,Had a cosmetic surgery years ago to address something that always gave me low confidence. The operation left me with lower confidence lol,"It fixed the issue but I always felt like my surgeon thought I was vain for doing it or that I was squirmy or unprepared the list of regrets goes on. 

I do look better. And I should be happy. But instead I’m plagued with the what ifs and wishing I could go back in time and redo it.

Embracing that I can’t change the past is helping, but I’m realizing I basically have to… activate a part of me I never thought was in me in terms of letting go, accepting, adopting new perspectives on life, choices, confidence, self esteem, etc. instead of just continuing the life I had been living without the thing giving me low confidence (gynecomastia). Like instead of just continuing being who I was without gynecomastia, I have to embrace an entire rebirth, and it’s very scary, to me. 

Guess I’m making this post hoping I can gain some perspective on why I should stop thinking about what I could have done differently for the surgery, and also, how to proceed forward without all of this clouding my mind so much. I am depressed, frankly, and it’s visible to my coworkers and friends, and I’ve tried to open up about the surgery, but it does not help. Guess that’s a lesson in its own. 

I’m 33 and I literally need to completely relearn how to… socialize… make connections, interact effectively, make friends, flirt, date, etc. I’ve been in this hole so long it sometimes feels like it’s impossible to think I’ll ever get out, but am also tuned into the “it’s never too late” mentality, which I don’t want to exploit, but would like to embrace.

1mpm3km,Agreed to go to a social event I didn’t want to attend,"Man fuck this shit, so a few months ago my mom made me sign up for a Police Explorers Academy which was absolute fucking hell. Hated that shit, and a few months ago one of my squad leaders called me to see if I was interested in another bullshit club/association. And me, whose dumbass is easily pressured by others and can’t say “no” for shit says I’m interested, so my squad leader tells me she’ll call me back to let me know if I’m available for an event to promote interest in the club, and I never gave it a thought since.


Well just today I received the call, and I fucking remembered what it was going to be about, so I let it go to voicemail hoping she doesn’t call me again. Well that didn’t work, she calls me a second time, and I don’t want to be an asshole so I pickup, hands shaky and everything because I absolutely fucking hate phone calls.

And she gives me a date for when the event is and asks if I’m available (I am), and I don’t know why but I say  yes instead of making up an excuse. 

Fuck my life, and she added me to a group meet and made a poll to see who’s going or not, and I’m fucked because if I press “Not going” I’m going to look like a fucking liar and an asshole who flaked on everyone (mind u only 5 other people are going which may seem fine but my social anxiety is worse in small groups of people because I HAVE to talk or else EVERYONE will notice I’m being quiet, unlike a party where I can disappear into the crowd). 

On the other hand, If I say I’m going then there’s no turning back, I have to go. My squad leader said to do the poll asap, but I didn’t do it yet since im still deciding whether to go or not. I REALLY don’t want to go but I also REALLY don’t want to be seen as a flaker/liar/asshole. Im screwed one way or the other.

And of course it’s the beginning of course so I’m gonna be stressing about this dumbass event on top of school. I fucking hate social anxiety.

1mpirj1,I discovered my social anxiety was getting worse from tiny interactions I wasn't even noticing,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something that's been a game-changer for my social anxiety, and I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this.

For the longest time, I thought my anxiety was triggered by ""big"" social events - parties, meetings, presentations. But I started paying closer attention to my daily interactions and realized something shocking.

I was having 15-20 micro-social moments every single day that I wasn't even consciously registering as ""social interactions."" Things like:

\- Saying good morning to coworkers

\- Small talk in elevators 

\- Cashier interactions at lunch

\- Quick hallway conversations

\- Responding to casual texts

\- Brief phone calls

Each one felt completely manageable in the moment. But by the end of the day, I was absolutely drained and couldn't figure out why.

It was like death by a thousand tiny social cuts.

The breakthrough came when I started tracking these micro-interactions alongside my anxiety levels. I discovered that on days with 20+ brief social moments, my evening anxiety was consistently higher, even if I hadn't attended any ""major"" social events.

What really blew my mind was realizing that these small interactions were accumulating throughout the day and creating this background social fatigue that I wasn't attributing to anxiety. I just thought I was ""tired"" or ""having an off day.""



Some patterns I noticed:

\- Monday mornings were the worst because I was already anxious about all the social interactions I'd need to have that week

\- Rainy days were actually better because fewer people made small talk

\- Working from home days had dramatically lower anxiety, and it wasn't just about avoiding my commute

The most helpful thing has been giving myself permission to acknowledge that these tiny interactions ""count"" as social energy expenditure. It's not all in my head - twenty brief conversations really do add up.

Has anyone else noticed this pattern? Do you find that small, seemingly insignificant social interactions contribute to your overall anxiety levels throughout the day?

I used to feel guilty about being ""antisocial"" when I'd avoid the office kitchen during busy times or take the stairs instead of the elevator to avoid small talk. Now I realize I was actually practicing good social anxiety management without knowing it.

Would love to hear if this resonates with anyone or if you've discovered similar unexpected anxiety triggers.",1755124116.0,5,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mps8wc,How to mentally prep for a big gathering of mutual friends at a show,"I go to shows from time to time with my bestfriend who introduced me, they've helped me come out of my shell more and more and I sort of know many people through them and I still go time to time just kinda sticking around 

so now there's a free show (basically no security) at a park where there's gonna be a lot of mutual friends(i use this kinda loosely they're mutuals online but more like acquaintances to me), it seems everybody has their own circles too though- I dont want to cling on to one person for this reason so im gonna be jumping from acquaintance to acquaintance (i dont wanna be alone as it's dangerous haha I'm in LA at a park at night inna huge crowd) REALLY putting my social skills to work I guess 

I know that deep down i really wanna go, it sounds so fun for a lot of new opportunities to meet people and really do something with my social life (I dont leave my house much nor do i like setting up hangouts outside of my little close circle) I can be extroverted but I am diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and really struggle with social anxiety 

 all this being said I can't help but to start crying and having my heart beat very hard at the thought of all these people I know & new people to talk to- I feel so small, stupid, and outnumbered at the idea of even trying to seem like I'm equal to these people (I can't help but have this strange complex when I really dont feel good about myself)

I'm gambling that it'll just somehow be a good day for me by then and I'll naturally feel more charismatic or something- but when I'm not I'm a shy boring mess with this complex that everyone's better than me how can I just COPE with that and be more functional??

1mp7vcy,"How I Deal with ""Why Are You So Quiet?""","Like some of you here, growing up, I've heard this question a lot by family members, teachers, classmates and it always annoyed me, even more so when I was simply minding my own business.  
I would then feel frustrated for not knowing how to respond which would ironically make me avoid talking to the person who asked that question.  
I only know I've had social anxiety and have been neurodivergent in some form (either from trauma or by being born with autism) which no person in my life ever fully empathized with.

Now I figured there are two motives for that question (the first one being more common unfortunately):

**1) If the person is rude / narcissistic / bullying / provoking / projecting, they will usually ask that question out of nowhere to put you on the spot.**

Example: One of my aunts is known for talking endlessly and making everything about herself. I remember some family gatherings where my dad and his siblings would talk about random topics and then suddenly, my aunt asks my dad ""Hey, why is he \[referring to me\] so quiet?""  
She then keeps talking about how her son (my cousin) is much more active and social compared to me (even though he also tends to keep quiet during our family gatherings). She intentionally raised her voice so that I could hear it from afar as well. My dad couldn't give a better answer other than ""He's just like that"".

**I realized that asking that kind of question creates a power imbalance. To restore that balance, it's best not to answer directly but asking the person back on a meta level. This shows you can read the other person's tone and won't take their bs.**

**Examples:**  
**-Why do you ask?**  
**-Do you actually care or are you just provoking me?**  
**-Do you want to discuss something specific with me?**  
**-What do you mean by that?**

See how you're now **putting the focus on the other person**.

A direct answer would have kept the focus on you.  
My literal answer would have been ""I'm not always quiet. I just don't know what to say right now. I also don't feel comfortable enough. I can't relate because you're all older than me. Etc.""  
Replying authentically like this wouldn't have helped here, it most likely would make you appear naive which subjects you even more to being mocked.  
Even if the other person left you alone after your answer, the power imbalance would still exist and leave you feeling frustrated while the other person would simply move on with their life or even worse, start mocking your quietness behind your back in front of other people.

I've seen some others' comments saying they would directly mirror the passive-aggressiveness by replying with ""Why are you so loud?"" or they wouldn't even respond and just shrug or stare at the person.  
The problem here is this will most likely not work with someone who is an authority figure or has a higher social status than you. A Karen type of person might turn the tables and accuse you for being the rude and disrespectful one instead.  
That's why I prefer staying on a meta level, this allows you to stay calm and stand up for yourself without having to stoop down on their level of pettiness.

Someone also commented they would repeatedly insist asking back ""What do you mean by that?"", ""No, no, I'm curious. Please explain!"". This is also a good method to catch someone off-guard, although I would reserve this method for moments when the other person aggressively throws hard insults at you.

**2) If the person genuinely cared, they would do at least one of these two things:**

\-They would **talk to you one on one** and instead of asking, they would **acknowledge you** and maybe offer help:  
Example: ""Hey, I noticed you're so quiet. Anything wrong? You can talk to me.""  
  
You can also be assured they genuinely care when they know you're usually more talkative with them so context matters as well.  
Example: ""You've been so quiet ***today***! Are you okay?""  
  
Only in this case, I would feel comfortable enough to answer directly.

\-They wouldn't even address your quietness (anymore) and simply **engage you in a** **different conversation**.",1755099611.0,13,22,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mpbl0w,Feeling like a zombie around people,"Hey everyone,

I’m 23 and I just started a software development job after being unemployed for a year. I thought this would be a fresh start. Finally, I could afford therapy, stop stressing about being jobless, meet new people, and feel good. But honestly, I’m not happy at all. This is my 2nd week.

Yesterday was okay. The office was mostly empty, and I actually felt fine. I went home feeling good. But today is the complete opposite. The whole team is here, everyone is socializing, laughing, joking, and I’m sitting there paralyzed. My brain feels like it’s on airplane mode. I’m hyper-aware of everyone around me. I overthink everything: what they think of me, if my face looks negative or repulsive, if I seem too serious or unapproachable.

I want to connect. I want to talk freely like they do, laugh, crack jokes, and feel at ease. I want to participate, but I can’t. It’s like my brain doesn’t work that way anymore. And it’s not just at work. Even with close friends outside of work, I feel the same emptiness, numbness, and lack of mental energy. It’s like I’m a zombie in social situations.

There’s no emotions inside me. I talked to my parents on the phone—they traveled recently—and I felt nothing. I miss them, I want them here, but emotionally it’s blank, dull. I want to feel again. I want to feel alive. I want my brain to work again. Please, help me.

I don’t drink, don’t take drugs, I eat well, and I sleep well. So why am I like this? Yes, I had a long-standing problem with por\*ography and I’ve been off it for a week. I know that in the past, long periods of abstinence helped me feel more joyful, so maybe this is part of withdrawal and rewiring. I hope so, because that would mean things can get better over time.

But to feel like this in a place for 10 hours a day, unable to escape, watching people be alive and connected while I sit silently with a storm inside… it’s crushing. It’s not the work, it’s not the hours—it’s my inability to access, feel, or enjoy social interaction. And it’s stressful for me, but seems like socializing comes naturally to them.

I’ve seen a therapist for about five sessions, but talking and listening to advice hasn’t fixed it. My social skills feel blocked. I used to be so good with people and words. Before 19, it came naturally. Now every word is hard to access. Social cues feel impossible. I don’t like this version of myself.

When I’m alone, I can enjoy myself. Watch series, read, go to the gym, listen to music. I can be chill. But I still crave social interaction because I know I’m a social person at heart. I just don’t know how to get back there.

Has anyone else felt like this? Like your brain refuses to work socially even when you desperately want it to? How do you get your social self back after feeling numb for so long? I want to feel alive again, I want my brain to work again, so please help.",1755107801.0,4,2,socialanxiety,anxiety

At first, I assumed the long hours or the work itself would be exhausting, but it’s actually the social aspect that’s crushing me. I feel down, negative, and blank-minded.

I'm always having to stick around him because he is the only person that actually cares for me. He always listens to me and starts a conversation with me and makes me laugh. Meanwhile, other people don't really talk to me. 

At school, there's his friends, which are nice people, but they'll always be HIS friends, they always prefer talking to him and themselves than me. I try to talk to others as well, but the conversation never actually develops. I see people in class laughing, having fun with their friends, meanwhile all I have is my boyfriend, and when he is not present...I don't really have anyone. There's this one girl that talks to me the most in class, but she sadly sits too far away from me and she is always surrounded by her own friends (who I've also tried talking to, but it always ended up in short conversations.)

I feel pathetic like this. People probably notice me sitting alone when he is not around, thinking that I'm a loser.

I can't really go out to socialize because I live with a person that barely allows me to leave the house. All I have left are my hobbies, which I can only practice at home. I know it's also bad that skipping school like this makes me miss content and stuff. But trust me, I tried to attend school some days where he wasn't present, and even tho I tried talking to people, I couldn't hold more than short conversations. Everything felt so boring because he wasn't present. I couldn't even focus on lessons due to this. I always fail at meeting new people, unless they are very welcoming and also starts the conversation (which 99% of the people there aren't).

I was always lonely like this sadly. I always think that next year will be better, but the same problem happens. I just wish I was actually wanted, that people would start a conversation with me. I just hate being this pathetic. I never have friends to hang out with, only my boyfriend's ones, but that's only because of him. I don't want to be a burden for him. I stopped talking to him about these issues because I lowkey felt like it was weighting the relantionship. Now here I am, lonely again.

1moyhjb,I hate being perceived + medication help,"I can't handle the idea of being perceived, I think it's the root of my social anxiety (and likely for many others too). I constantly feel inferior to everyone around me, an I'm scared about people figuring out that I am inferior to them. I feel like if I speak up in a group, people will just give me a blank stare and wonder why I'm even talking. That type of potential humiliation is constantly on my mind, which causes me to be very quiet in public and socially anxious. When I'm at home, I'll often ruminate to myself about interactions I had and what they probably think of me. 

I'm currently in a graduate program at school, and it requires a lot of mandatory classes and group participation. It's a nightmare for me. I'll often sit in these classes silently while the rest of my group talks because of my fear of being perceived or potentially humiliated. Afterwards, I'll feel awful for myself for not working up the courage to speak up. It sucks even more because I know I'll have to see these people a few times a week, and they probably have a weird image of me.

I know these fears are irrational and logically I shouldn't care what people think, but I just can't help it. Does anyone know of any medication that helps with these thoughts? The only anxiety medication I've ever taken is propranolol, but that only helps with physical effects.

1mpa4wj,How do I become more social in the new school year,"I’m 17 and school is starting tomorrow again. I do have a few very good friends, but I’m getting new classes with new people and I don’t know anyone in some of these classes. 

I’m constantly worrying about what other people are going to think about me and always make myself fade into the background, because I just can’t talk to people. I mean I can act normal, but often I still am awkward and I wouldn’t ever say more than I have to, otherwise I feel like I’m going to suffocate. 

I always think that everyone is looking down on me and that my every movement is being watched. I know that it’s stupid, but I just can’t help it. I thought that as I would grow older it would get better, but it has just been the opposite. 

I have tried to go out of my comfort zone from time to time and have made little achievements with my social skills, but my progress is so minimal in the grand scheme of things, that it almost makes no difference. I’ll never get anywhere at this pace. 

When I was a little kid, I was friends with everyone and was liked by everyone. It was all very simple and I had no problem getting along with others at all. I don’t really understand why I’m so different nowadays. I mean it’s mostly fine with my friends, but the only reason I am friends with them anyway is because I befriended them at a point where I had no trouble with that kind of stuff yet. 

During the summer holidays I was really happy, because I was by myself and had nothing to worry about and I didn’t bother thinking about what would happen once that was over. 

Last week I visited my sisters place for a few days. We don’t have the same father and she is a lot older than me, but I grew up with her when I was a kid. She moved out when I was 9 years old I think. Though she used to visit from time to time. 

I like my sister a lot, but I was even awkward with her. I wasn’t quite anxious like I would be with other people, but that made me really sad. I couldn’t be myself around her and act normal, even though she is my sister. 

I’m so tired of it. I don’t want to be like really popular and always go partying or anything like that, I don’t like that kind of stuff, but I just wish I could be more normal, but whenever I try to talk to people, I feel like so out of place and boring. 

I’ve always been the worst at school, I can’t talk to people and I don’t have any hobbies either. I don’t really have anything going on in my life, but I can’t keep doing this. If I just become a background character again that will affect me in other parts of my life as well and I can’t afford that. 

How do I just act normal? How do I stop worrying so much about what other people think of me? I always assume that they secretly think badly of me when they are being nice to me.

 I can’t talk to others because my mind is blank, I have nothing to talk about and when I try to keep a conversation going it just gets very awkward or I just can’t.

 I apologize if I am complaining too much, I just don’t really know how to say this. It’s just so hard for me to talk with other people, even if I know that they don’t actually care that much, but it’s so hard. Especially when it’s so many new people at once. I feel like they’d rather talk to anyone else, I feel like I just don’t belong here, I don’t know.",1755104634.0,2,2,socialanxiety,anxiety

I don’t have any friends and it’s starting to get to me again. I’m 21 and I’ve been basically friendless since I turned 15, with random short term friendships in between that always ended badly. I’ve only ever been able to make friends in the mental hospital because that’s the only place I’ve been that has other people my age or people that can relate to me. 
I can’t work or attend school because my anxiety is so bad that I faint. I take meds for it but as of now I can’t manage it. I’m doing TMS in hopes of improving those symptoms but I’m not gonna hold my breath.
I don’t drive for the same reason. So even if I had a place to go for meetups, I don’t think I’d be able to handle being there. 

Sometimes people interact with me irl and I just don’t know what to do. We have a small chat and then what? If I ask if they want to be friends they get weirded out. They say I’m too desperate or coming off as creepy. I don’t know how to organically communicate with others. If I don’t do anything we both just walk away and never talk again, but if I try to advance things I look like a weirdo.

I can’t even make online friends. I get chats and I find people that have stuff in common with me but nobody feels like a true friend. Everyone feels like a brick wall or just words on a screen and no matter what I do, that doesn’t change.

Kissless virgin due to my crippling social anxiety and fear of rejection and being made fun of by others. I cannot and will not approach women in a way of asking them out. Never been rejected because I don’t want to find out. 

I struggle with crippling insecurity. I am always worried about what other people will think of me. I can’t even listen to music, sing, dance, or do anything even slightly expressive because of how afraid I am of being made fun of or negatively judged. 

I have no friends left. All have moved away. All of them are doing better than me both financially and emotionally.

I have no desire to meet new friends due to people rejecting me and making fun of me for hanging out with certain people.

Make no money as a building substitute and football coach. Wasn’t able to land full time teaching gig out of college because social studies teaching jobs are oversaturated.

I get depressive spells where I have no energy or desire to do anything and want to die. But then I get these random euphoric episodes where I am flooded with new ideas and plans, even if they are completely ridiculous for me (business plan, writing books, day trading, etc.) I feel like my brain moves at 1000 miles per hour during these instances. 

I already use Zoloft and have seen 2 different therapists. Results have been minimal.  Insurance no longer covers therapy. 

I feel like a burden to my parents and family living at home.

1moy52n,vent,"this is going to be very scatterbrained, and i'm not so good at writing so i apologize

i'm 18 and recently graduated high school. it started during high school. sometimes i would start shaking and sweating and kinda panicking, usually when doing a presentation or when i'm asked a question.

when i would talk to people that arent my close friends (who i became friends with before this started happening to me) this would happen, and even when it didn't happen i could still feel myself ""choosing the wrong dialog option"". after any interaction i would realize how awkward i was behaving. this compounds with me having difficulty understanding people and people having difficulty understanding me.

the feeling is gone or reduced when i'm with friends or my mom. i can't order food alone but if im with someone it is still difficult but possible.

i've mostly given up on talking to people about my interests because i can talk to myself perfectly fine, but if i talk to someone else i stumble over my words and cant explain anything well.

in elementary and middle school i wasn't like this. i was outgoing and was making lots of friends. not everything was perfect though, i was in trouble often because of talking when i'm not supposed to. this would have been fine, except i was unable to shut up. tourettes and adhd were not helpful there. i think this along with some other things caused me to withdraw.

all my friends have a job or are going to college while i can start crying from thinking about a job interview. it feels like it is easy for everyone except me. it is a little relieving to see this subreddit and knowing that atleast someone else has the same feelings and experiences.

i feel like if i tell anyone these things they will think i am lazy or just dont care. i DO care, i just get stuck so often (overthinking or getting distracted) and end up doing things the day of the deadline.

i was able to do high school because i am required to. it sucked but i did it. i want to get a job, i even feel like i would enjoy it but i can't bring myself to experience an interview. the longer i dont get a job, the more upset at myself i become. the more upset i am the longer it takes. a really unfortunate self-reinforcing cycle.

interviews make me think of every question at school that i struggled with. things like ""tell me a time you experienced a challenge and how you overcame it"". i have terrible memory, i cant think of a good answer for that question. even if i had good memory i don't really do anything that would be relevent in an interview.

even ignoring the interview, what do i put on a resume? i've never done any sports, wasn't in any clubs or groups, i only did band in middle school. the things i have skills for is stuff like computers, programming, electronics(ish). most everything else i am slower than average at.

the thing that really sucks is that jobs that require these skills need either higher education or good proof of skill(like git repos or projects). unfortunately, i have neither. (none of my projects are finished or good)

am i just supposed to say that i'm a good problem solver and troubleshooter? if i were to say that, how would i prove it? i help my friends with computers but i can't remember anything that i've fixed. i've fixed some strange issues on my own things but again, i can't remember the details.

this means i need to go for a job that doesn't use those skills. what else can i do? probably nothing warehouse related as i dont know how to operate a forklift and im not exactly strong. i know beggars can't be choosers but i would really like to avoid food service or costumer facing jobs for obvious reasons.



i wanted to write more but its really late here. heres one positive thing before the pity party is over: i've made some really good friends from a tech class my last semester. they even share many of my interests. though, they haven't graduated yet so i end up doing nothing most of the day.

1mnum27,Got fired after only 6 hours of work,"I'm super bummed. I avoided in person service jobs for a long time because I thought my SAD would hold me back, but I worked on my social skills for a couple months, and went from zero eye contact to being able to hold it for a majority of a conversation. I gained enough confidence to apply to a service job, and was hired right away, so it felt like a special moment of change for me.

I began working last Friday for a part time job as a busser and worked a 3 hour shift. I was still in training, but I think I picked up on things quickly since I do a lot of lab work in college. The pace was easy, and I adapted quickly to the workflow. My boss came in during the last hour to watch me work, and by the end of it, I was given a lecture about smiling more. (I had made an effort to smile when interacting with customers, though not much with teeth and I did not smile much outside of customer interactions) 

I worked my second shift today and tried my best to take the advice to heart. However, right when I came in, my second boss gave me a lecture about smiling more and being more positive when interacting with customers, so I assumed my bosses talked about me. I kept that advice in mind, took initiative to speak up more and smile at the beginning and end of each convo, and even interacted more with my coworkers as practice.

I worked for three hours before my break and felt good. I did not have moments where I was standing awkwardly, received many smiles from customers, and got to know my coworkers more. When I came back in for the last ten minutes of my break, I saw my boss sitting alone at a table and thought it would be a good time to talk to her and get to know her more.

1mo9nk1,This is what works for social anxiety,"I've fought this for a while and made some progress and go to therapy and do constant journaling and meditating and I will not go on with that list. I've found that neediness and tension are that which make you repellant, and really neediness is repellant because it causes tension so you end up with just one thing that screws everything up: ***tension***

Basically, without tension everything goes well. I won't go into why that is. The target that you need to hit in order to become magnetic (because in fact this is the base of being magnetic) is fear reduction.

With that in mind, I'll give you four things that work **really really well** to at a core reduce your fear:

1. **Withdraw from validation**. Exposure doesn't work if your tension is caused by neediness. I don't wanna extend this whole story but if you are stuck in this journey look into validation seeking and neediness and shame and codependence and maybe limerence and anxious attachment and emotional neglect and that whole stack of terms.
2. **Exposure therapy**. I'm gonna go on a yap here because I have a lot of things to say that you can rarely find elsewhere.
   * Exposure actually works by making you fear the situation less, next time. That means you have to suck the first time doing something scary and there is no way around it. **You are building future capacity to have good social skills in such situation**. What no one told me is that social skills are mostly a state thing, even if you have great social skills, under a state of fear, they will disappear.
   * Exposure means cooling off certain fear triggers. They will still be there and go warm after some time that you don't do exposure (2-4 weeks in my experience). It's just the reality of the matter unless you're doing reconsolidation but I haven't ever done that. Build a life where that doesn't happen. For me some triggers actually I think were permanently cooled off - one of them being hugging. If you're interested it took me maybe 20-30 hugs for them to become de-shame bound for me and natural.
   * The very tricky thing about hugs, and this applies to any sort of exposure in general, is that as you try doing them they'll be clumsy, misattuned and you'll be tense because you're scared. If you're tense that is instantly a red flag to the other person. In a weird way that creates this thing where you'll have a higher chance of them rejecting you the first few times, and really, this applies to everything, that's why I said what I said in bullet point 1. As you desensitize your brain from making a whole story about that, and you start finding them not as scary, people will take kinder to them, so there comes a tipping point where it snowballs and you basically completely extinct the fear.
3. **Bulldoze** in the present moment. This warrants some explaining. If exposure is I didn't die so I can be freer next time, bulldozing is wow I can actually socialize really well any time I try and people mostly take kindly to it. Say you go into a social interaction and your brain is slow and you're judging yourself and you say something and it's off and you say another thing and it's received poorly by the other person as well. This creates a vicious cycle and you'll probably end up walking away more ashamed and afraid in the end. Or if you don't, you were fake, you couldn't really express yourself, you weren't dynamic, you start judging yourself for it, etc etc. There's two reasons for this: 1) you had tension; 2) you didn't get into a flow state. Bulldozing allows you to overcome both these things. Bulldozing is warming up. It's feeling the fear, yes, and then doing exposure. But if you recall, exposure only works to make future situations less scary. In the present, what'd be ideal for you to do is to just completely remove your fear and that's possible via this method. So you feel the fear, you say something, screw up, say something, oh, it was tense, it was fake, etc, and at a certain point of saying things you will temporarily become immune to the random little fears that are keeping you stifled. It's not a permanent state so that's why doing exposure too is a must. You get into that state, people start taking kindly to you, you start getting validation (which btw not all validation is maladaptive and not all validation should be withdrawn from), that validation makes you even more open, it's a virtuous cycle.
4. **Reconsolidation**. Reconsolidation is a scientific term and it basically means the following. If you just do exposure there is a high chance that you just create another neural pathway where the feared outcome doesn't happen. So you have the one where it does happen, and the other where it doesn't, and as you go about exposing yourself, the connection of the good outcome is strengthened but at any point the old neural pathway can reactivate and when it comes to something like social anxiety that basically means your disorder returns. That's not ideal. Reconsolidation is basically opening the specific connection of the feared outcome and feeling the feared outcome, and then going out and exposing yourself after having done that, something like 10 minutes after doing so. That makes it more permanent. That edits the original fear memory. It cools it off forever. Now the amount it's cooled off is again dependent on how much you repeat exposure but at least you don't have to whack the mole again and again and then realize you started fearing something again after 2 weeks of not doing it.

Oh and one final tip, the way in which I wrote all this is very intellectual. Don't socialize like that. Socialization isn't about yapping. It's about vibing. It's just that people like us usually resort to using the intellect because the fear just introduces too much noise to the baseline vibing signals.",1755007502.0,15,4,socialanxiety,anxiety
1moeiqt,How do I grow a spine and stand up to my manager?,"I'm an introverted people pleaser and social anxiety is my kryptonite. I work part time, three days a week. My manager keeps me over time (if she tells me to stay I feel too guilty and scared of her to leave when my shift ends, even tho it's not my job to stay overtime and she is perfectly capable of doing it herself.) She gets upset at me for taking my one 15 min break, that I rarely take to begin with, I never take a lunch break at work. And despite only being scheduled for 3 days a week MAX she keeps trying to guilt me/schedule me without talking to me first for FULL TIME hours. I can be as assertive and firm as I need to be to set my boundaries over text, but the second it's face to face I'll bawl my eyes out if someone so much as gives me a dirty look for no reason.

1mot7ar,"Any videos, guides or advice to get rid of my speech issues?","I've had social anxiety since I was a child. My speech issues were god-awful when I was a minor and not even my own family could understand me.

I'm a young adult now, and they've definitely gotten better but I really, really just want to get rid of them permanently.

I want to say things once and have people understand me the first time... I never want to feel like ""my speech issues are so bad even my family can't understand me"" moments again (cuz again, it's gotten better but I still have a lot of those moments every now and then). I want to feel like my age. 

I've never been able to do official speech therapy or anything like that and I don't have the luxury to do so now or in the far future either (and tbvh my SA prevents me from even seeking professional help in the first place).

What helped me the most was recording myself and listening back to it and trying to improve with the next recording (I wanna be a youtuber as a hobby one day, cringe Ik lol). But I feel crazy and get funny looks for recording myself like that. I mean it's understandable bc I still live in an apartment with family, but it fuels my SA and makes me want to hide in a wall. It's also just so painful listening to my voice as it is right now. My voice is one of my biggest insecurities. I wish I could trade it for an actual, deep, mature, adult voice instead of...whatever tf this is. There are even kids that haven't even made it to 2 digits sounding deeper and more mature than me, why did God have to do me dirty like this?

Anyways, getting back on track... I also feel like if I'm not keeping up with the cycle, my speech issues stop improving and kind of (not completely but kind of) regress a bit. So that's why I'm reaching out on here. 

I'm aware that some of the possible solutions you guys might send might need me to go through recording cycles again, as long as it's not super noisy (anymore side eye and I'll go insane lol), I'll try it. Honestly they don't even neccesarily need to be labeled as permanent solutions, I'll try it. 

SA is a real bitch. It's a shame I don't live alone so I could just record comfortably away from ppl at night. But then I would need to have fixed my SA and speech issues to begin to think of living alone. SA is living nightmare fr. ",1755054158.0,1,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

Im a pretty introverted guy and only have a few friends around me. The school im currently in, is a school that I joined this year (2025). I left my old school because the teaching in higher grades was very poor. I had been in that school for most of my school life. But again, I was very introverted and only made friends in the 8th grade. There was this one student who we'll call Jake. Me and Jake were really close friends. After i left in 2024, he stayed. He complained that the teaching was very bad. He was thinking about coming to my school. I told him it was his choice but deep down, I didn't want him to come.
You see, Jake was a VERY extroverted person. He also cared about his looks alot. He stuck out from the rest of us ( Im Bangladeshi and the people in my old school were mostly coloured people as I lived in Africa). He used to have a slickback then middle part then he just switched between the two. Me on the other hand, I was a very chopped individual. I used to wear my fine straight hair down which looked like a bowl cut. I was also very short, I could not talk to girls and only knew a few people. Coming back to the problem, in the school im currently in, the majority of people were Muslim. So obviously they thought that his haircut was somewhat zesty. And I was affected by the bullying because I knew him. I no longer want to be around him. Im asking myself two questions.

For context for me, im a supply teacher (sometimes in a long term teaching position having my own class)always trying to make a good impression on others teachers and definitely the principal to show that I am a good teacher so they will hopefully hire me as a contract full time teacher or at least for more supply days or long term positions.

1moaozp,Idk what to do with my life.,"Hello, I have been intensively thinking about quitting my job.

I just finished my apprenticeship in January and got employed by the place I did my apprenticeship at and since I started I knew it wasn't really what I wanted to do but my family grew up poor and I just wanted to make money after school and had no idea of my options or interests.

And I still don't. 

My job is draining all of my energy. For some reason everyone is trying to help me get higher up the food chain and become a manager but I am 23 and have social anxiety, can barely manage my usual tasks and this is too much responsibility for me to take on.

While for others this might be the help they need I just want to quit more when they push me. But the job pays really well. Like, absurdely well because it is a big company. I make roughly 3000€ on average in once month.

I wanna go for a degree now, which is probably what I should have done right out of school but I just couldn't bring up the courage and my mother isn't a help since she is so old, idk if she forgets about stuff or wants to sabotage me tbh (with old I mean 60s, idk why I am even alive. My dad would be >80 if he were still alive).

Idk what to do. I am scared I won't find a job or realise all the job options aren't for me and I will have to start over again. I get easily excited about topics but the more I think about it the more I realise the workplace dynamic would send me into a panic once more. And all the jobs I get recommend by google when I look for something more anxiety friendly aren't something I could see myself doing.

Like working with plants because I am scared of flying insects, especially bees and such. No computer science because I am honestly not good enough for that and don't own a pc and in school I was terrible at it even if I hot an A (curtesy of my project partner).
I am terrible with my native language, so libraries are out of question and while I have been looking into archaeology (job options include museums and archives which is cool), I was in AP history and barely passed and am scared of flying, so I couldn't really go to other countries.

And while I know school can trick you sometimes into thinking you are bad at a subject because of the way they teach, it is difficult to grasp any ounce of confidence to actually pursue a degree with that subject.

I just don't know what I like or want to do in my future. I am scared of trying and failing. And i am scared of quitting too because of the way they might judge me (I have a 4 weeks notice period that I would have to use all of September to start a degree on time). 

I don't have anyone to rely on that could help me if push came to shove; Only myself.

And this is all just a lot. Figuring out what to do, how to finance, where to go, moving, quitting, handling the reactions.

I just don't know what to do.
It is so easy to say ""just do what you want to do"" when people have support systems or the monetary options but I would literally put my life and family dynamic on the line.

1molyyw,"Forget books, forget videos - this is the real key 🔑","Action. 
But we want to make this action as bearable as possible, so it’s practical and doesn’t cause further trauma. 

My solution: 
Become a street fundraiser. 

I have been at the job for 2 weeks now, I was just made a team leader today. 

I was so close to not even showing up to the interview because my anxiety was so bad, so glad I stuck it through, I was close to quitting several times in the first week because I found it so challenging. But in this life what I’ve learnt is we must walk through fire in order to become the person we were meant to be. 

And what I’ve also found is, despite having social anxiety for years and years, those with social anxiety are actually meant to be social the most. The very importance we put on social situations is evidence of this. We care so much, too much, we can’t control this energy so it turns into anxiety. But if we overcome it and learn to control it, we can actually connect with people in amazing ways. Further evidence of this is I love this job, I’ve been scared of people for years, yet I love people and meeting strangers excites me the most in this world. 

What I’ve found in speaking with hundreds of people, is that my body has been in flight mode for so long, it’s tense, it’s alert, my personality is behind this shell for protection as a result I speak with monotone voice, I don’t show off my personality and just try to get by. I overthink conversations during, before and after, never saying the right things in my head because my mind is thinking practically. 

Amazing realisation: Relaxed body everywhere. 
Let go of thoughts 
Feel your body 
Feel the your feet on the floor, feel the sensations of your legs, arms, relax them.
DONT THINK
FEEL GOOD
Practice this everywhere, at home, at the gym, in a public area with people, and then try it in social situations. 

Important step: once you’ve relaxed your body, 
When speaking with people next - 
Feel relaxed when seeing them, ignore the minds automatic programmed thoughts etc”( omg danger, danger, possible awkward threat)” 
Ignore - back to body, feel body, feel good in body. 

In social situations:  relax your body, 
THEN: share this relaxation with the people your speaking to, let your relaxation seep over into the conversation, feel comfortable around these people, 

It’s all about feeling relaxed and feeling good around anyone. 

Then your personality will come out and your body will know what to say, it will feel amazing. You will be flaunting your personality at your own whim, and it will feel so natural you will be shocked at yourself. 

But again practice this as much as possible. 
Our bodies have been wired wrong for too long folks. 

Heal this faulty alarm system wiring with relaxation. 

Breath in, feel the breath go through your body. Feels good doesn’t it? Let your body know it’s safe.. ",1755034985.0,0,6,socialanxiety,anxiety

Ngl I was kinda hurt but I expected this to happen exactly

My problem is Im so bad at being the first one to strike up a conversation and I always wait for people to come up to me. All the other people in my class have their own groups and they make it seem so easy to have a conversation going without trying. And here I am struggling to even speak to someone that I don't consider best friends with.

This leaves me kind of fomo and embarrassed for myself. I only have 1 best friend in the entire school and 2 other acquaintances. Others have so many friends to depend on and not having to worry about how to make friends on the first day of school. Personally, my main problem is keeping a conversation going and interesting and starting one as I always overthink about the awkwardness. Socializing is one of my biggest fears.

Up till this point as a grade 11 with only 1 person to depend on in the school, I begin to feel the thought of am I ever good enough? Why must I struggle with this till the point where I feel so alone in class? Why did I turn out to be an introvert? Am I that boring that people don't wish to talk to me?

1mo38tt,Trying but failing,"
For about 3 years I’ve been struggling with social anxiety and finally I feel like I’ve made some progress. Not overly worrying about the quality of conversations just being genuinely interested and present has helped me a lot. I often initiate conversations and try to ask questions about people to try match their vibe and learn about them. Conversations are actually enjoyable now and I crave them. 

But even with my new openness I feel like there’s something so dull about me and my responses. It’s like I just don’t have anything to say and although I’m told not to worry about it and focus on being interested. When people crack jokes or try to be more silly I just fall short. Things go dead pretty quick. 

My coworker that I’ve been mainly talking to just seems exhausted being at work and I’m gonna assume I have something to do with it as he’s a very humorous and social type of guy. Also he’s told me it gets tedious here and he might look for another job. He’s pretty much checked out now and we only have short conversations about a few topics and work related issues. 

It sucks trying to insert my humour into things and it just falling short. It’s like people just laugh to be polite but it’s definitely different from when they’re genuinely laughing with other people. Or sometimes just dead silence. I’m being genuine and not trying hard to land a punchline or anything so it just seems like idk what else I can do, I can’t be any more relaxed. 

Even talking to people at parties, I just become the listener for most of the time and have trouble just vibing and being laid back. I’ve been pretty antisocial for a year and it’s like I just don’t have the sauce to make it work. So I’m starting to lose hope and go back to my silent ways. 

Any advice from ppl who’ve been in the same boat would be so appreciated. ",1754987817.0,5,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mnxk37,update after 3 years of college,"I first made a post here 3 years ago asking whether I would regret missing social opportunities as a freshman in college. I'm now going into my senior year, and I've really learned a lot about myself and what it means to be alive. My answer to my question still isn't easily answered, and a lot of the anxiety and conflict over interactions with others remains. I've made friends and lost some, worked for a while, dated a few partners, and entered into academic and social clubs and left some as well. I won't lie and say that every time I chose to take part in something has turned out well, but ultimately, I've really found some people in my life that I'll love and be close to forever. For some of the times I've turned down, I've regretted my decision. In others, I look back and am so grateful that I did. I honestly don't think I could have handled some of them. The greatest thing I've learned in the last few years is to be honest with myself and push myself in areas I know won't break me. The continuous trying, even when it didn't end the way I wanted it to, is honestly the reason I'm here today. But truly, I want anyone who might feel conflicted over this same question to know that there are great things lying in wait for you out there, and that even if things are impossibly hard, it'll be ok. The world is a better place for having you in it, and it can be ok for you to have a little bit of the world as well.

1mnhnuh,I seem cute to my fellow women because of my social anxiety. Is that good or bad?,"I am a student, male. I am quite introverted, reserved and quiet, and I have a lot of social anxiety and a little bit of agoraphobia.

One problem is that my group of male friends is totally different from me: they are very arrogant, loud, restless, they always make jokes with double meanings and sometimes they get unbearable about the subject. Also, although with me we would be a group of 5, I only feel good and talk to 1 of them, who is my best friend, and I always follow him, as long as social anxiety doesn't kill me when he starts talking to other people.

The fact is that in my course there is a group where there are only women. And sometimes, for some reason, that group of girls hang out with my friends. And they always bother them and make fun of them with their sexist jokes.

It's already very difficult for me to talk to someone of the same gender, and it seems almost impossible to talk to someone of the opposite gender. So when they come closer, I get very quiet and uncomfortable.

But those girls are realizing that I am very different from my friends, because while they are always insulted and made fun of, they never say anything to me and I never insult them.
And sometimes they come up to me and say things like ""you're very calm"", ""you're very good"", ""I like you"", sometimes with a smile, sometimes laughing and murmuring to each other. And they treat me very differently than my friends. They are always treated with insults and ridicule, but when they rarely speak to me, they treat me well and with affection.

Do you think they really like me or feel sorry for me or something?

   The next year im am going to graduate from school, and this makes me so stressed, cause i am  going to uni, i am going to need communication skills or  at least  stoppped being so sociophobic. The last 3 years i was on individual tuition cause of my heart problems. Also as everyone in 2020-21, i studied online. All of this made me so isolated from society. I was never really friendly or convivial, but i had a few friends in school. I dont think that someone could call me unsocial, i was able to find common ground witn others. But now i dont think that i can do this. I dont have friends or some kind of social circle probably for about a year or more.  I stopped hanging out with friends I had a long time ago.  Most of the times, i talk only with my mom, sometimes with my sister. Or to my teacher during the school year.  Of course i have social interaction like with cashiers, baristas etc. But a few months ago it was big deal for me to just order coffee or even go fir a short walk. I felt so anxious. At some point i still trying to deal with this, to fight it. I didn’t have problems like this four or even three years ago. 
  Two years ago i had depression, this was a long and hard period. Almost year i was drowning in feelings of hopelessness,  everything felt so distant from me. Sometimes there was a feeling of derealization. But then i have big changes in my life and my life seemed to be normal. Back than i remember that i thought that it was just some kind of regular mental problems, maybe all teens had this. I was wrong. Ten months ago depression came back. Im glad that this time i didnt ignore my feelings and turned to psychologist. This helps me to understand that my isolation played a big role in the onset of depression. I saw how this affects on me, my relationships with others, my mental and physical health. But i still struggle so much with my self isolation. I became used to be alone, and i rarely want some company. Because i just get unaccustomed to company. It feels like i need to learn how to talk to people again. It is a big problem. You know isolation its like addiction, each time it gets worse. And you dont even understand the problem until its change your entire life.
   At the moment i dont feel that anxious or stressed when i talk with someone. But i still didnt build any friendships or at least some kind of relationships with people my age. Usually, i am trying to make friends online on platforms for finding people with common interests ( cause, even if i have progress at socializing, it stiil hard for me to talk to strangers offline).Yet something still doesn’t work. I get acquainted with someone, everything goes well and i find our conversation fascinating. But in a couple of days i lost interest, or better to say: I forget to write or I just don't feel like writing to this person or does communication feel like an obligation. But to put it more simply, I no longer feel like communicating. Maybe i just need to try another way to find friends or interlocutors. I dont know what to do.

Recently, I decided: “I have to build my life here, find friends, maybe even love.”, because loneliness is killing me. And then I realized… I have no idea where to start. I don’t speak the local language. I only know my native language and English (around B1, maybe B2). I also don’t have a job at the moment.

I decided to at least try and downloaded T\*\*\*\*r (don’t judge. pls). I scrolled through profiles and felt awful, because everyone here seemed to have something: looks, stability, achievements. And I couldn’t think of what I could offer. My self-esteem just dropped even lower. I don't know really if this app is a good place to find friends, but still, when I found a person who I think have lots of similar hobbies with me I stucked on ""like"" him, anxiety hits me and I turned off the phone. I can't even press ""like"". 

I’ve worn a hearing aid my whole life (I can only hear with one ear). This makes it hard for me to follow conversations if someone is more than two meters away. My social skills aren’t great because of it. Obviously I do have friends, but they all live in other countries. Here, I’m completely alone.

Sure, there might be people here who speak my native language, but I am also not confident in my English, I can text with people, but in-person conversations… I have communication problems even in my native language, especially when I have to ask someone to repeat themselves because I didn’t hear them. But here, it’s English (which is not my first language, I would even say, it's my third) and it’s even harder for me to understand English by ear. I start imagining all these situations and I get anxious.

I don’t know how to break free from this feeling, especially when I start thinking: “Would anyone even want to deal with communication problems like this?”.

1mn4441,How I’ve been beating the sunday scaries lately,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share a few small things I’ve been doing to ease that awful Sunday anxiety (aka the Sunday Scaries). I used to dread Sunday evenings, like this creeping stress about the upcoming week, but these quick habits have actually helped me feel a lot more grounded:

1. Plan Ahead - I’ve started taking 10-15 minutes on Sunday to plan out some basics for the week, things like outfits, meal ideas, and a rough to-do list. Nothing intense, just enough so I’m not waking up on Monday feeling totally unprepared.
2. Make Time for Real Self Care - I used to doomscroll all evening and call it ""relaxing"", but lately I’ve been more intentional. I take a bath, read a book, or just sit outside with tea. Doing something that actually recharges me makes a huge difference.
3. Protect Sunday from Work Thoughts - I’ve set a hard boundary: no emails, no “just checking something real quick” for work. Sunday is my time. If my brain starts spiraling into work mode, I redirect it.
4. Gratitude (yes, it sounds cheesy but it works) - I’ve been writing down 3 small things I’m grateful for every Sunday. Sometimes it’s just “good coffee” or “my dog being cute.” It really does shift my mindset from anxious to more grounded.
5. Move a Little - Not a full workout or anything, but a walk around the block, a short stretch session, or just dancing around while cleaning up. It gets me out of my head and into my body, which helps a ton.

Anyway, just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else dreads Sundays like I used to. These small things don’t ""solve"" everything, but they’ve made Sunday evenings feel more like actual rest than a panic spiral.

Would love to hear if anyone else has little rituals that help?

Note they aren’t talking about anything private or whispering to each other because If they were I wouldn’t interrupt or come over there in the first place. 
Anyway, If they are talking about something I know a little something about or just swapping stories I might share a story of my own or even crack a joke, because I like to make people laugh.

1mmx0qw,How do I get out of this cycle?,"I have come to the realization that I’m hating how my life is right now. I complain and sulk about having FOMO and being stuck in this redundant cycle of getting up going to my part time and sleeping. I wasted away my freshman year of college doom scrolling and just going to work. 
But now that I’m about to start my sophomore year, I’m realizing I can’t keep continuing this. Cliche as it might sound, I want to be able to travel, be financially stable, and have meaningful connections. Which means getting into socializing events like clubs and such.

1mmhthz,How do you cope with loneliness and identity struggles?,"For some context: I’m a 25-year-old guy. Since kindergarten, I’ve been dealing with bullying and exclusion, and it followed me through every school I attended. It always felt like I was “chosen” to be the class target. I know I was an easy victim — shy, quiet, chubby — but I never hurt anyone. I just wanted to be left alone, but that never happened.

Because of those years, I’ve been left with a lot of trauma and anxiety, and I never really learned how to build friendships. I feel useless, like I wasted my youth in isolation, while everyone else was out having fun, sharing their lives, and forming meaningful connections.

I used to train in Jiu Jitsu, and on my last day my coach bluntly told me I always looked tense on the mat. He said he thought the sport would help me open up — but I never did. Then he added, “I think you might have a problem with people.” That’s something I wish I’d never heard.

These days, I do everything alone — going to the gym, walking, shopping, concerts — anything you can think of. I do it just to feel like I’m part of society even for a short moment. But none of it is fun anymore, and I’m losing all motivation to keep doing it by myself.

I have no idea how or where to meet new people without coming across as desperate. I know I don’t exactly look approachable, and no one turns their head when I walk by, but I don’t want my appearance to keep getting in my way.

That ties into my next problem: parasocial relationships and daydreaming. Whether it’s people I used to know or my favorite artists, I spend hours every day imagining interactions with them — even though they would never notice me or care about how I’m doing in real life. In these daydreams, I’m not myself — I’m someone entirely different: loved by everyone and successful. It’s gotten to the point where I do nothing else during the day, and it consumes me. I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve never been loved or appreciated, or if there’s another reason, but in my head everything happens exactly the way I want, without exclusion or rejection.

And then there’s my identity struggle. I have Turkish roots, but for years now I’ve had a love–hate relationship with that. Part of it is because of the country’s current state — politically, socially, and economically. I’m actually visiting right now and seeing it all firsthand. When I was a kid, the country was beautiful, people were warm and welcoming, and life felt vibrant. But for almost a decade, the economic crisis has been dragging everything down, including people’s behavior. I barely recognize the country anymore, and I find it hard to identify with it.

Politics in Germany and Europe also make me avoid mentioning where my name comes from — but it’s obvious anyway, so I can’t really hide it. Honestly, I wish my parents had given me a German name. Maybe that would’ve been one less thing to deal with.

1mmu9u7,all my thoughts circle around wanting friends (so nothing is fun),"i did a smartphone free day yesterday and instead ended up staring at the wall for 10 hours.

i'm just feeling really bad and i realized when i didn't doomscroll that i had no inclination to do anything else because i'm so lonely.

i'm going out regularly in hopes of making friends one day.  but there's not an event at all times.

don't know how to get a better life.

p. s. if anyone answers something here thanks in advance. i've never posted before and i might be too afraid to open reddit or answer for some time.

pps: what's currently on my mind (might lose urgency soon though is) if i meet someone and think they are a mature and pleasant person and i want them in my life a lot, but they only think of me as an acquaintance. it hurts to only be an acquaintance but is it better to cut them out completely? then i wouldn't have them in my life at all....

that person in question might leave by themself though :') think i drove them away by being too vocal about being hurt and wanting to be closer than they want to be",1754860288.0,4,5,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mmuvfy,social anxiety leading to suddenly feeling weak/dizzy/high?,"Hello guys

  
I have social anxiety since I was a child, but I still can get sociable and talkative, open...

However, if I may act and feel well at first in social interractions, at some point I feel like I am crashing. Im thinking unwell and a bit sick, like when you get paler because of stress. Im a very white person so it might not show so much but I have these moments when I suddenly start feeling bad.

I remember once feeling a bit like that a new doctor place, my blood pressure was 17 instead of the usual 12. But I also feel that sometimes and my blood pressure is normal.

  
Anytime I get stressed by random events I also suddenly become weak and just unwell, that prevent me from maintaining social interractions well

  
I also have back and leg issues, so my body not being 100% sane I guess it might add to that

1mmcbcg,boss can sense my low self esteem,"im 22 and i was a very shy kid. i still am but i push myself really hard to grow each and every day. i recently joined a male dominated workspace as a girl- this is my first serious job too. i was proud of myself. a big office full of people was scary- but i initiated conversations with people or small groups + speak in morning meetings for my team. 

but then i heard from a relative who works with me that my boss and colleagues think im too nervous, shy, bubbly, and have no confidence. i have a natural tendency to giggle and smile a lot especially when there is awkward silence or i have nothing to say. i doubt myself a lot- i have the fear of being cocky but completely wrong. im really scared to make a mistake too. ive been asking a lot of questions and for a lot of help. 

i let little things get to me. when i heard this, it made me feel like that little girl again. the one who “never talks”. i get called naive, insecure, shy, innocent, weak constantly constantly constantly to my face with no filter and behind my back. people say they can sense my low self esteem and lack of confidence. by friends, family, acquaintances, now my boss and colleagues. 

i don’t blame or hate them. i just hate how weak i am. sometimes i don’t want to continue on with my life. i don’t see a point in living if i live so uncomfortably. i just want to be a kid again. but even then, when i was a kid i was unsafe and uncomfortable. 

my parents aren’t to blame. they were lovely people. for a long time, i blamed my older sister (15 years older than me) because she was a scary criticising bully growing up. criticising my height, weight, hair, every single detail.

then i see my little sister is starting to be insecure and anxious the same way i am. but my older sister has changed after moving out and getting married, she doesn’t bully my little sister. so maybe it’s genetic. 

the starting point would be my vocabulary. i want to stop saying “i think”. then i want to stop laughing and smiling so much. i want to be stern, cold and straightforward. i don’t want to be the innocent naive insecure girl anymore. ",1754810858.0,38,1,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mn12kg,"My school played a huge part in my social anxiety, but this project in particular…","Tell me if your school had an assignment like this. I’m in college now, but I still remember my high school experience. And I would never wish it upon my worst enemy. I have vented about it on here before, but there is more since the project is over so I just wanted to vent

I didn’t go to a normal public school. I went to a K-12 preparatory school. I’m going to describe it as a public school that tries so hard to be better than everyone else. There isn’t as much bullying which is nice, but honestly, to say I am grateful I went to this school would be a lie. I’ve always had some bad anxiety, (I was on Prozac for some time) but It gave me a lot of anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, etc. and there were ALOT of issues that lead me to my anxiety but the worst thing about this school is their “capstone” assignment.

It’s called the senior thesis. It’s a 15 page paper. You’re basically given two “classic texts” (this is a classical education) and have to read them over summer. Then you have to make a philosophical essay and then you’re hooked up with a teacher advisor to help you. And THEN, you have to do an hour long speech where you have to dress up and then answer questions in front of a panel of teachers and an audience.

They believe it’s a massive privilege to do such a great project (all this showed me was they’re unnecessarily elite). Oh but goodie it gets better. This project follows humane letters class/cirriculum. (HL is basically English that makes you seminar for 2 hours). But they want to REALLY force students to do this project. So rather than making it an assignment in HL class, they made it a WHOLE CLASS ON YOUR TRANSCRIPT!

No joke, they literally made it a .25 credit assignment, so if you fail, you can’t graduate. Yes. A 15 page paper and oral defense depends on your graduation. Now you could redo it, but I don’t think a paper should be dependent on your graduation. During the writing time they wouldn’t let us use computers! And the senior thesis director was an AH. He yelled at my classmates over something that wasn’t our fault, and gave us a rubric the day before the first draft was due.

For a 17 year old with horrible social anxiety, this SCARED me. I already didn’t go to a friends house all throughout HS cause my anxiety was so bad. Now I had to do this! I already hated reading. Now I had to do a speech and basically a debate in philosophy in front of my teachers and an audience.

Absolutely the f not. Idk if I was technically allowed to do this, but I wasn’t about to FULLY lose my sanity over this nonsense. I moved my defense date to an earlier one to get it done with sooner, and basically locked down the classroom. I pretty much uninvited everyone (including my parents since it made me nervous so I recorded it for them) and only invited in two of my closest friends. (The teacher panel was fine with it)

Typically after everyone finishes the defense, they celebrate and socialize with others. Me? As soon as they said congratulations, I left the room, said bye to my friends, ran into the bathroom to change into my work clothes, and went into my shift at Starbucks. A job and something that truly brings me joy.

This probably sounds like something stupid to be upset about, but that assignment hurt my mental health a lot. I was giving a speech about books I really didn’t understand and I didn’t feel like myself. Counted down the seconds it was over.

Why are we forcing teenagers to do this?!? Most schools don’t make students do this. This school claims to be a college prep school, but my college is nothing like this. When I went to college, I couldn’t believe how much better it was.

There have been other students that have had panic attacks and people have left the school cause of this assignment. And while my grade all of us got thru, there have been students that couldn’t walk because of a dumb defense. I’ve even read some stuff in the handbook about it and it all seemed so STUPID

Either way, this school was no very accommodating to students with anxiety. I’m in college now and my anxiety isn’t nearly as bad, but I still have panic attacks and don’t socialize almost ever.",1754878714.0,1,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

When I see someone that I think is on the same level of attractive, funny, or confident as me, I can socialize great! I can make good jokes, add conversation, ask questions, etc. Same with if I see someone younger or as/more shy. 

But when I see someone more funny, more attractive, more smart, more confident, or more popular, I cannot socialize anymore. 

I get so anxious and self conscious and think I’m not as good as them. While I’m anxious talking to them, I feel like I freeze and all my thoughts go blank. I literally cannot think of anything to add and become so awkward because of it. 

I was going on a few dates with this guy. I was completely fine the first 5 dates!! I could be myself and was making us both laugh and holding conversation. But the last time we hung out he was talking about his older friend group and I realized how much better he is at socializing than me. 

I thought about how we’re different and just became anxious being in his presence. I got scared because I realized I can be weird and awkward while he can talk to anyone, like we’re just on different levels. I ended up being so awkward throughout the rest of the night because when I’m anxious I freeze and get no new thoughts, just silence.

What the hell is wrong with me? I hate that I’m like this. I know it isn’t an issue with my social skills, I can socialize well when I’m not anxious or not feeling inferior. But the second I see someone more confident or popular I freeze up, get a blank mind, and become so awkward.

1mmgi2d,I feel like I’m wasting my youth,"I’m a 15 almost 16 year old girl and I struggle quite badly with social anxiety since the end of the pandemic. 

I have always been a shy girl but it has worsened over time. I struggle to make friends and most of the ones I do end up making are online, who all live very far away all over the country. I am grateful for them, but I do wish I could make IRL friends who I could spend time with. 

My town doesn’t have many places to go to so I’m usually always in my house. I am working to try and do more things at home, but usually I spend most of the time in my room/bed. 

School is starting back up soon and I know it’s just going to be depressing. Since I have no friends I constantly throw myself into school work. I always strive to do my best and get things like high honor roll all year. I feel like this is one of the only things I’m good at, so when I don’t receive good grades I feel like a failure to myself and my family.

Family is also a tough subject for me. I love my parents but they don’t understand me at all. I lack in self-confidence and usually have episodes where I just start crying and feeling worthless. My brother is a whole other can of worms, he’s younger than me but continuously tortures me. I am not close with any other family members either. I have grown up and realized they are all either weird or complete assholes. 

I am also a huge nerd (not grade/school wise). I love collecting fun/cute things that make me happy. I watch anime from time to time as well but I’m not weird about it, I just like cartoons and appreciating animation. I like collections and watching this stuff but my own family bullies me for it and makes me feel like I can’t even like simple things. 

It just feels like I’m constantly wasting my life away and I just want it to stop. I constantly question why I was even born at this point. I don’t have a job yet, but I’ll be able to get one during school/next summer. I want to save up to try and see a therapist or something along the lines so I can get a bit of help.

They just get along better and do everything together and their dynamic works so well and I just never really fit. We have one week left together and the first week actually went great, I've been going to therapy and working against my social anxiety and I didn't even feel that left out.

We were having so much fun before, but now I just feel like I don't fit!

1mmkky8,"Lyrica, or Buspirone - Anyone tried both?","Sorry for the medicine X vs. Y thread again.

Background: 40-ish years. Always struggled with social phobia. Diagnosed GAD at 20. Prescriped Alprazolaam on demand. Has since then, mainly on my own, managed to manage my anxiety and live a reasonably normal life (wife, kids, house and a good career). But my anxiety is still there. It never went. Going to the lunch room makes my stomach turn. Social events (which I'm at my stage is expected to partake) in makes me come up with white lies (and white lies have an ending date...). 

  
My biggest phobia is however social speaking, where I get anxiety spirals that are impossible to control. So far this has been ""managed"" by alprazolam. The magic on/off button. It works, but it also has a tendency to be sneaky in terms of tolerance, dependance and convincing yourself to take it in situation where it would help but you COULD manage without. 

My goal is to be benzodiazpeine-free. I know I never will, probably. But I hope that a regular  medicine prescription can take that edge, reduce the required alprazolam dosage and maybe make me do it with out it. Because, honestly, I've outsourced my emotional management to alcohol and drugs my whole adult life

  
Anyway, anyone tried Lyrica or Buspirone? I've been on Sertraline. Horrible side effects and no help on anxiety. I've read that both Lyrica and Buspirone CAN have similar effects as the BZ-drugs but without the negative effects. But I never believe what I read, and of course need to test on my own. Just curious if anyone has this exact experience.

Do you take this approach socially? Does it ever drain you?

1mmgmym,Breaking Free from the Spotlight That Doesn’t Exist,"There’s something I’ve been carrying around for years, and only recently did I put it into words: I’m not really living my life. I’m living halfway in reality, and halfway in the head of a person who doesn’t even exist. Here’s the reality: Whenever I want to do something I truly want — whether it’s starting a project, trying something new, or just making a decision for myself — I freeze. Not because I don’t have the time or skill, but because my brain immediately jumps to: “What will people think?” I start predicting every possible judgment: They might misunderstand my intentions. They might think I’m trying too hard. If I fail, they might turn it into a joke that sticks forever. I get caught in this loop of overthinking → imagining ridicule → deciding it’s safer not to act. It’s like I’m living under a spotlight that doesn’t even exist, but my mind swears it’s real. The escape hatch: the “perfect me” When I’m doing something mindless, like listening to music, part of my brain slips away into another life. In this fantasy: I have a different face and body. I carry myself with confidence. I’m bold, free, unbothered by criticism. I act in ways I wish I had in the past, or I live in futures that will never happen. This “perfect me” isn’t random — I build it from pieces of people I admire in my real life. In my head, I am that person. And in those moments, it feels good… better than reality. But here’s the problem: The more I live in that imaginary life, the less I feel urgency to change my real one. My brain gets the dopamine from the fantasy without me taking any actual risk. This isn’t just daydreaming. It’s a psychological safe zone. The fantasy is protecting me from the possibility of failing in real life — but it’s also trapping me in place. I started thinking: what if instead of escaping into the perfect me, I used it as a blueprint? What if I could build a bridge between my real self and my fantasy self — not all at once, but piece by piece?",1754826923.0,2,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mm29bk,Got tailgated and honked at aggressively by a former professor,"My boyfriend and I were driving home when this happened. I was turning right (maybe a bit too slowly- I had a lot of fragile things in the trunk and didn’t want to be too jerky) but a car that was clearly speeding got up on my tail once I turned and flashed its lights. I could also see him throwing his hands up in the air in my mirror. I got up to speed and thought they’d eventually leave me alone. 

We got to a traffic light and when it turned green I drove forward. At this point I kinda can’t remember what exactly went wrong (or if anything even went wrong). I drove straight, so I definitely didn’t creep into the other lane. All of a sudden I hear three loud honks behind me, and I look over to see the same aggressive persons car dangerously close to mine. I thought maybe he was trying to get in behind me, but he pulled up in the other lane so that he could see in my window. He was visibly angry, shouting, pointing his fingers at me. That’s when I realized he was actually a former professor of mine. I think maybe he realized I recognized him, or he knew I was a former student, and he quickly pulled forward. I pulled forward to get a better look at him and he just stared straight ahead. He took the next exit, so I honestly don’t know why he was trailing so close behind me in the first place. 

Overall, I’m anxious, confused, and pretty embarrassed about the whole situation. My boyfriend assured me that I did absolutely nothing wrong and he was just being an aggressive driver. Still, I keep replaying it over and over in my head trying to think of something I did wrong. Driving is a pretty big source of my social anxiety, since I overthink how people perceive me a lot. If this was just a random person I don’t think it would be affecting me this much. But since I actually know this man, and he was one of my favorite professors, I’m just so embarrassed.

He’s very extroverted, and I’m not sure if he will understand. He wants to introduce me to his friends but I tell him I’m not ready for that because I assume he’d want me to reciprocate. I’m  too embarrassed to have a convo with him that I don’t really have any friends to introduce him to.

1mm02cq,"I used a tiny thing that I didn't think could possibly work to stop the mental spirals, but it did","It used to seem like my brain would suddenly take control of me. One minute everything would be all right, and then all of a sudden there would be intrusive thoughts. What happens to my children? What if I made a mistake at work? What if I've just become anxious, overwhelmed, and broken?

Once it began, it always felt like a wave that I couldn't stop.

When I first saw this technique in a video, I must admit that I initially rolled my eyes. It was far too easy.

Still, I gave it a shot.

I would stop whenever the spiral began and literally respond to the thought. Not in my mind — aloud. I would say things like:

Right now, I'm safe.

My opinions are not facts.

I won't drown if I ride this wave.

even when I didn't think it was true. Particularly when I didn't think it was true.

And what do you know? Something began to change. I had a slight sense of control. And a little light came in through that tiny crack in the panic. It was real, but it wasn't magic.

This isn't just a ""feel good"" thing. Your brain is being retrained. turning off the autopilot. breaking the cycle. Neuroplasticity is exactly that.

You are not required to be ""ready."" Waiting until you feel at ease or healed is not necessary. The next time the spiral begins, just try saying one positive thing aloud to yourself.

It enabled me to begin escaping a situation in which I believed I would be trapped indefinitely. I see you if you're there right now. You're not by yourself. And things can improve.",1754773008.0,16,1,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mmao0o,Bringing emotional immaturity to the table,"This is just something I've been thinking about as I'm getting older. 25F and have never dated due to a combination of things, social anxiety being the most glaring factor of course.

Sometimes I feel the desire to experience love and have a meaningful relationship like everyone else. Perhaps I've gotten too comfortable in my own space, because other times, I'm just not too keen on the whole concept. 

After some reflection of my interactions with friends/family, and people in general, I think a big part of my hesitation stems from my perception of my emotional maturity. 

In terms of navigating interpersonal relationships, I feel as though I lag behind everyone else. One obvious reason for this is that I've just never had the capacity to push myself to experience life like everyone else. One thing in particular that does bothers me though is that I've never really had a real dispute/argument with friends or family. 

My social anxiety comes with people-pleasing qualities, so if I've ever had an issue with someone/something I would willfully ignore it and bottle my feelings up and just get along with my life. I've just never had a one-on-one conversation with anyone to settle our differences in a mature and meaningful way. This makes me hesitant in finding love, as I feel as though I'd make a terrible partner.

I want to be a good partner. I want to be someone who is sensible and mature. I want to be someone who communicates well. I just don't know if I have the capacity to at this current point in my life.

To those with social anxiety who have found a partner later in life, how was that experience for you? Did you feel similarly to what I feel right now, and how did it play out for you?

I was need to make a photo on my passport. I went to the local store, came before the opening(there was about 10 minutes before opening). When it opened - some guy came and said, that he was here for a half an hour and he will go first. I tried to fight back, but he started harrasing me(without direct insults) and I was just so frustrated. I just was feeling like a baby, who couldn't defend myself. Even after he went first - he continued harassing, just laughing me in the face and provoking me. 

There were some other situations, but the main problem - they just keep flashing in my mind. I'm feeling secure only when I'm with someone I trust. 

I even stopped feeling secure at home, aftery neighbor turned off my electricity when I was in a hospital because of my alarm.

It's not just your imagination, when you're stressed, your body alters how you breathe and use your vocal cords, which impacts your voice.

The good news? Even if you don't feel calm on the inside, you can teach yourself to sound calmer. You can project confidence by speaking more slowly, taking pauses to catch your breath, and paying attention to your pronunciation.

I was scared people would be thinking what I was eating was weird or i was eating weirdly. I am and was chubby and a part of me thought people didn't think i should be eating.

I tried eating in the bathroom but it would be weird taking my bag to the bathroom everyday.

I tried eating in a secluded place but people would just appear. I ate under a bridge once and a few people saw me and thought I was a loner and suggested I hang with them. I felt so pathetic that I just decided to stop eating. That way i didn't have to figure out where to eat. I still ate dinner and breakfast.

I did that for three years. Im a lot better now and can eat in front of people but I still feel uncomfortable doing it.

Ever since then I dont have any hunger cues.
In the beginning, an hour or so after lunch my stomach would rumble (i was so embarrassed). But now i can go multiple hours of not eating and my stomach doesn't rumble or ach. I just feel weak. I have to eat at certain times to make sure im eating. Because I just don't feel hungry.

I feel like everyone is looking at me and my whole body is taken over by my fears and subconscious. I think this is now a problem on a cellular level because I feel that fear of being criticized and underestimated in all my cells. In the past, I was always known as a quiet child. As you can see, I was quite shy. When we went to the guests, they always praised him for being a good boy, although I don't know if this was praise or something else. I've never had a proper conversation with people. As my peers grew older, I was always surprised to see how they started chatting with the elders in the neighborhood and how they spoke without fear or hesitation. I have never called my friends' mothers aunt or their fathers brother and uncle... I don't know exactly why, but I've always been like this. While I thought I would get better when I grew up, everything got worse. I couldn't talk to anyone anymore, I even dropped out of university so that no one would see me as a lonely and silent person, because high school and middle school were very difficult for me, and of course there was a lot of mobbing at school... As I got older, I started to feel more ashamed of who I was. I've been hanging out in my room for about 15 years so that no one would know me as a quiet and shy person. 

My age was over 30. I go out, but to get to the point, when I go out, my body freezes. I can't even look around me in the subway, at a stop or in the market, I can't make eye contact with anyone.

Travelling.
I dont mean big expensive vacations, i just mean like a day trip out of town or something. Having to ocassionally interact with a cashier or bus driver or friend of friend/relative helped me handle small talk more. 

Lexapro.
This drug makes me less depressed than it does less anxious but it does help to a point. It doesnt help in extreme circumstances but it helps for basic socializing. Been on for 4 months now 10mg. Tried venlafaxine and while it worked it made me really sick. 

Weed.
I open up so much when im high in a really sweet way, kinda a yapper but not loud or a problem like being drunk. Made alot of friends over a smoke 🥰

Forcing myself to do things. 
When i know something would be better for me but im scared i stop thinking about it and just go for it. helped me improve panic decisions and overthinking which would just cause me to not get anything done. 

Not caring about what others think.

1mlninr,Texting advice please,"Sorry if this is dumb but honestly I love that reddit is a place where I can ask dumb questions I've always been too embarrassed in person. I am wanting to know how often I am meant to respond to tests, how much people check up on others, and like how much people need to text within a month in order to maintain basic friendships? I have friends from high school or middle who I care for deeply but I am not the kind of person to necessarily crave being around friends physically very often. But that doesn't mean I crave being in constant contact on phone either. But honestly that is especially due to not knowing the duration of texting. Like for one session how long am I meant to text? And  when a conversation stops at a response where another question cannot be prompted then how long do you wait to start a new round of conversation? I love 
my friends but I don't actually like texting. In general unless it is for a specific topic I struggle which leads me to simply wait until I inquire about in person hangouts later on. But honestly as I've been making new friends I have run into multiple times where I go let's say 2 weeks without responding to a message and they simply never respond back. For me I've had a friend where we wouldn't message for months and it didn't matter. I've gone a years as well no contact with some friends. But I always had a tie to them somehow that I know made it so that it was less easy to break the bond simply due to no messaging. But I'm extremely introverted and do like spending time with people but only as much as I feel like is required for society I suppose? Like I know that I'm supposed to do more than at least once every other month or so maybe? if I don't keep myself in check i understand i could make them think i do not like them and have heard of people assuming i was not interested jn being their friend when younger which made me up my frequency but since im not in school where i have that constant association i no longer get feedback.  I don't want them to think I don't like them i just genuinely dont know how and when. How often do people text and reply and stuff like that? Just any basic guidelines would be greatly appreciated thank you. And plus if you feel like giving me conversation ideas for topics. Do I send articles and prompt conversation from that? I'm guessing I do that based on their personal interests which I don't mind but yeah in depth what are some tips please. In person I'm not terrible although I do get anxious in louder places due to needing to drown the surrounding sound out at times with nervous laughter or weird cringe jokes but ultimately I think I'm getting better at it. But texting yeah I'm lost. How did people learn to text. I had a close friend growing up who later was diagnosed with autism and so I guess maybe that played a factor in me learning innacutately since she was the main person who I learned texting through due to knowing that she was my best friend at the time and so if she didn't assume I hated her then I thought it was fine? She and I would hang out for occasions and mainly message in regards to meeting in person even afterchanging schools after middle school and I never had any issue of her assuming I did not want to be friends with her. If someone doesn't express being dissatisfied with my messaging I don't know and so I know I cant expect that advice at 23 years old so I want to do better but am struggling to find out where to learn . My current friends are very sweet about things but I'm not as close as I think I am supposed to be and although I would like to deepen the friendship I am stuck on how. We didn't meet based off of mutual interests exactly for some of them and so our interests are a bit misaligned at times which I do not mind but it makes me curious about how to go about. I don't want to come off as strange for the articles on topics they enjoy but is that the normal way to go about it and I'm just overthinking? But if so how many articles a day?

1ml7gt1,I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna face my fears. All at once.,"Hello.
So I thought I'd make this post, hopefully it will help someone.

For the context, I'm f20. In a month, I have a trip planned all by myself to Berlin. Traveling alone, including navigating the airport, flying, and finding my hotel is going to be very scary for me. I've never traveled alone and I feel so lost. I'm scared I'm going to do something stupid, not know something, or that someone will talk to me on the plane.

But not only that, there is also a much bigger fear. I'm starting uni in two months, so I decided to go on a 7 day camp with other new students. There are going to be sports activities (I'm not athletic at all), swimming activities (I'm very insecure about my body in a swimsuit), night disco parties (I've NEVER been to one, a club, or anything. I've never had a drink too, mostly because of my meds), and some other social activities.

During my 4 years in high school, I haven't made a single friend. I was all alone, miserable, depressed, and anxious. I could go days without saying a word. I celebrated all my birthdays by myself and haven't had anyone say ""happy birthday"" to me in years. I'm scared of making eye contact, of doing something or acting weird. I can't dress properly and look cool like other people, and I'm pretty awkward with that too.

So you see, everything I've been avoiding is now concentrated into a few weeks in September. It sounds dreadful and terrifying. But I thought that I have to do this. I have to face my fears. I have to enter the cold water; it's going to be unpleasant at first, but after I get used to it, it would be more normal.

I will update you after all of this. I'm going to tell you how it went and I'm going to reflect on some mistakes I made during the trips.

I like to remind myself that if I avoided both of those trips, I have already failed. But if I go on both of them, I either fail and gain valuable experience, or I succeed. We shall see.

1mlnoge,Should I take the opportunity?,"Hi everyone, I hope you guys are doing well! 

So I’ve been really overthinking over the past few days; I finally put myself out there (on tinder😅) after years of thinking about it and I’ve been talking to a guy for a few days.

My problem is that it’s almost only been sexual and we don’t really have the same values but he’s really nice and patient with my anxiety, like I don’t have to overcompensate out of anxiety, he’s really laid back. 

But I kinda know that he just wants to sleep with me and I think I don’t really mind and I’ve been in a dilemma. As a virgin (at 24) that’s really curious about sex in general, I was wondering, should I take the opportunity of him wanting to sleep with me and just do it or should I hold my ground of finding someone long term? I don’t think I’ll be in a similar situation anytime soon and I really want to experience it for myself but I want to stay safe too. I was telling myself that since I’m aware that it isn’t serious (even if that’s what I told him I wanted), I’m not really being used, if that makes sense lol

Using a throwaway for this because it’s a bit personal. I wanted to see if anyone else has gone through something like this.

I started therapy thinking I had social anxiety, but honestly, it was mostly just shyness. The problem is, therapy and the pressure to “fix” myself actually made things worse. I ended up quitting jobs, becoming a shut-in, feeling ashamed about weird behaviors or withdrawing from people.

I think all this fixation on my social anxiety made it develop into full-blown social anxiety. Looking back, I feel like I kinda messed up my life because of it.

It's not that I dislike my neighbors, I just don't want to talk to them. I want to enjoy my walk alone, I don't want to wave, I don't want to say hi, I want to enjoy my dog alone.

Lately I've been trying this thing where I just smile and don't say anything, so we'll see how that goes.

Those of you who live in an apartment with social anxiety, how do you handle walking your dogs when passing by others?

1ml7p2k,im scared to go back to school,"I’m starting 9th grade, the last year of elementary school here, before moving to high school. At the start of summer, I lost my best friend, Jane, who’s also my classmate. We grew up together and did everything together, but she told me to choose between her and my other close friend, Zoe, after they fought. Zoe has always been there for me, so I refused to let Jane control my friendships.
Jane ended our friendship, and during the last week of school, she avoided me and only talked briefly at the end of class. I later heard she called me two-faced. On her birthday, I didn’t wish her anything since I wasn’t invited, but she complained to others that I made myself the bad guy.
Now I’m scared about going back to school because I’ll have to see her every day in the same class. We’ve fought before, and it’s very hard to be around her when things aren’t okay. Most of my classmates are boys who stick together, and the girls can be two-faced. I feel like I’ll have no real friends at school, and I don’t know how to handle it.

1ml87m0,isolation & loneliness,"(F17)

Why do i feel the urge to isolate myself whenever I feel unwanted or indirectly threatened  with abandonment? I used to have this urge to isolate myself as a coping mechanim in my first and only relationship before they cheated on me, now it happens even with friendships too and that scares me. I start to feel guilty as I wonder why I do it, because when the urge goes away, I feel like I will always be ""that difficult vampire energy friend"" or an attention seeker. Do I do it because I want to feel wanted, to see if people actually check up on me to prove that they care about me? Do I feel tired, like I don't deserve any friends? I don't know, i'm clueless. 

I feel like I always mess up somehow so people avoid me or leave me, which makes me feel like I need to prove that I'm really funny, perform or do something for someone so they can actually continue to talk to me, I view it as a deal. That's how lonely I feel. I feel really, really immature. I feel ashamed when I do this, I feel like I always ruin everything and like i'm a narcissist asking for attention and reassurance, but I also like it more when I am completely alone, It calms me down in a way. I tell myself that maybe it is better this way. 

When I feel sad, I have an urge not to reply to texts for hours. I've always been a lonely person with a small circle of friends, I crave love and connections, but if I want to keep the ones that I still have, why do I do this, since I know that it won't make it any better?

1mld39y,comment je me sent seul face aux autres personnes,"Nous, êtres humains, sommes souvent perçus comme les maîtres de la planète, détenteurs d’une intelligence unique et d’une capacité à façonner le monde à notre image. Pourtant, si l’on regarde de plus près, nous sommes aussi, et peut-être surtout, une aberration pour ce monde. Une aberration née non seulement de notre impact sur la nature, mais aussi de la cruauté que nous manifestons entre nous, au quotidien. Dans un monde où la solidarité devrait être la clé, où le respect de l’autre devrait primer, la plupart d’entre nous choisissent l’égoïsme. Ils s’enferment dans une vision étriquée et limitée de la vie, pensant d’abord à eux-mêmes, à leurs intérêts personnels, à leurs conforts immédiats. Ce réflexe d’autoprotection, au lieu d’être une force pour construire un avenir commun, se transforme en un poison qui ronge les liens humains et déchire la société. La cruauté des hommes ne se manifeste pas toujours sous la forme de violences physiques, parfois elle est plus subtile : dans l’indifférence à la souffrance des autres, dans le jugement hâtif, dans l’exploitation des plus faibles. Combien d’histoires de maltraitance, d’injustices, de trahisons, racontent cette réalité ? Combien de fois avons-nous vu l’avidité prendre le pas sur la compassion, la compétition dévorer la coopération, la haine masquer l’empathie ? Ce qui est encore plus tragique, c’est que cette attitude égoïste ne profite en réalité à personne sur le long terme. En refusant de penser au bien commun, en s’isolant dans nos bulles personnelles, nous affaiblissons le tissu social qui nous soutient tous. Nous creusons notre propre tombe collective en détruisant la confiance, en minant la paix, en accentuant les divisions. Nous sommes comme un cancer qui détruit l’organisme dont il dépend. Il y a pourtant un autre chemin possible. Celui qui nous invite à dépasser nos intérêts personnels pour embrasser une vision plus large, plus humaine. Celui qui nous pousse à agir avec bonté, à faire preuve de générosité, à penser au bien-être de l’autre comme une part essentielle de notre propre bonheur. Mais ce chemin est difficile, car il demande de remettre en cause notre ego, nos habitudes, nos peurs. En fin de compte, être humain ne devrait pas rimer avec cruauté ou égoïsme, mais avec responsabilité et amour. Nous avons en nous la capacité de construire un monde meilleur, où la richesse ne serait pas celle des possessions, mais celle des relations humaines profondes. Ce monde est possible, mais seulement si nous acceptons de sortir de l’ombre de nos aberrations pour embrasser la lumière de notre humanité véritable. juste le mec chill signé samir bettayeb

1mkr0ww,Overcoming my social anxiety has left as a worse human being,"A quick background. I've had adhd my whole life and according to my psychiatrist, plays a big role in my social anxiety. After a few tries with  prescribed meds, Strattera has worked wonders for me. I'm more confident and care less for what people that aren't important to me think about me.

So my college friend lost his mother about a month ago. Before I was on Straterra. I would make in effort to check up on him through texts, calls during the semester holiday. Even if I didn't want to, I did it for him even if i felt awkward because he said he didn't have anyone and I genuinely felt bad for him. 

Fast forward, a new semester on the new drug. Everything is going well, cracking jokes, talking more and just being a more fun person to be around ( or atleast trying to). I checked on my friend and for some odd reason I didn't care as much and I feel like a shitty person. I heard and remembered everything he said to me today, and I know his struggling but all I could do was nod and ask 1-2 questions before we were interrupted. I care less for his problems now and I feel as if maybe being the socially awkward but caring person I was before, is probably better for me and the others around me. It was so much easier to think about what someone was going through and put myself in their position, which also made me a people pleaser, and also do and say things i dont agree with so i can make the others happy, but now it feels like an inconvenience to care. I would never say that to anyone or express it, I just dislike not caring. I miss caring.

I see why people don't open up to others, because wow is this what it feels like to not care much for others? 
I'm thinking about quitting the meds or atleast not take them when someone needs my attention.

Anyone feel the same way or is it just me? Even took online tests to see if I was self centered the night before because I care less for anyone.

My mom said it's okay, because I can't care for everything, but I can't even care for my friend...

1ml3yvd,"I don’t know why they watched me, but it still gets to me.","Eating alone at school: 🤡

Eating alone in public:🗿

When I was a loner in Grade 9, there was this clique from my batch who would stare at me while I ate alone and usually laughed loudly from a distance. Over time, I developed a habit of glancing at them, convinced they were laughing at me. The more I looked, the more irritated I became—especially at how loud and obnoxious they were. They kept doing this for most of the school year, and that’s how I remember them.

I started to notice a pattern every recess and lunchtime: some of them would linger for several minutes near the small, caged outdoor animal zoo close to where I sat—always laughing before leaving. At first, I thought they were just checking out the animals, but then I realized something strange: they always tilted their bodies in my direction. I never saw their backs—only their faces—because they only went there when I was around.

That’s when it hit me: they weren’t looking at the animals. They were looking at me, through the zoo nets, like I was the exhibit. Their entertainment.

I thought it was most definitely bad intentions—Their stares made me feel uncomfortable and exposed.

Even after I changed my lunch spot to another bench, they continued doing the same thing, which only confirmed my suspicions. I bet they laughed like usual when they saw me turn my seat to avoid their eyes—as if I was doing exactly what they wanted: to feel uncomfortable, to flee. I remember glancing behind me after turning my seat. I was partly shielded by the tree inside the circular bench, and when I looked up, I saw three silhouettes huddled together, intensely staring. 

“What were they chattering about, always so close like that?”

With their eyes like bulging out, it felt like a horror scene. That was just straight up creepy. I looked away for a few seconds, and when I looked back, they were gone.

The next day, I saw a jacket and water jugs placed on my usual spot. But I wasn’t going to let anyone take over the only place I had finally settled in. So I sat there anyway. A few moments later, the same clique came and sat by their stuff. We exchanged a quick ""hi."" I sat on the opposite side of the circular bench from them, and I overheard one of them say,

“Did she not see the bright red jacket placed there?""

Like, did they expect me to move just because their stuff was there? Obviously, I wasn’t going to.

When I was about to eat, the burrito I had bought turned out terrible, so I went back to the canteen. I thought that worked out in my favor since I didn’t want to stay there any longer. But right after I left, they moved to a different bench—near mine—when there were plenty of other vacant ones. And of course, they started being loud again. I could hear every bit of it.

It reminded me of when a guy uses the urinal right next to you even though there are other empty ones—just why?

Even if they sat next to me, it didn’t matter. What was I supposed to do while they talked—feel jealous? I wasn’t even listening; their voices just faded into background noise. If anything, it only made me want to leave even more.

At first, after that “hi” I thought maybe things were fine. I even started thinking, ""maybe they’re not that bad after all."" But that comment about the jacket made me second-guess everything. Were their intentions ever genuine?

Now in Grade 10, I’m still skeptical of them. I’ve found a spot away from all that now, but I still don’t really know what any of that was about. Recently, on my way to the canteen, I saw them sitting near the place where I used to eat. Seriously?

Maybe all they ever wanted was to eat there... and I was just in the way.

Now when I see them as classmates currently, I’m left wondering, “What was all that before? Why?”

Back then, they kept looking at me, but now that we’re face-to-face, they don’t even glance or make eye contact. Why is the time they spent bothering me in grade 9 longer than the times we had brief exchanges in grade 10?

Well there is sometimes brief eye contact, but why do they look at me the moment I instinctively glance at them? It makes me think—maybe there was something there all along.

Every time they’re in my line of sight, I put on a cold or blank stare, and just keep affirming myself to move on. 
But it’s been bottled up for so long—I’m tired of convincing myself I’ve moved on when I haven’t. 

I feel annoyed, disturbed, and unsettled. 

This instability,
my own worst enemy.

Is it okay to feel this way—irritated everyday just from this silent battle, thinking their actions speak louder than their words?

I thought the only way to finally move on is through venting it out. I’m not diagnosed or in therapy, but this felt like the most fitting place to post.

This is my first job after working myself through therapy for about 3-4 years. After college i hit a major wall when trying to find a stable job, and a place in the workforce. 

Thankfully I managed to be honest with the people closest to me that I needed help, because thoughts of ending it all had started to feel uncomfortably real to me. But I got help from doctors and psychiatrists and got diagnosed with social phobia at the age of 28. I got meds and a long treatment plan. 

And now I am starting a new chapter on that journey. I woke up today with a feeling of dread. I got a panic attack, and on my way to work I almost burst into tears on the sidewalk. But I got to work. And if I can say so myself, I think I kinda nailed it today. 

Now I'm at the end of my day. I am exhausted, and pretty sure the dread will be there when I wake up tomorrow for work (I got two full days alone as my start to the job, I think accepting that was a big mistake).

1ml9h8q,First day,"Today was the first day of my sophomore year, this year i decided to only take a class i usually do year round at only the end of the year. This was due to drama and just wanting a break to find myself. 

I signed up for a media class, it was really good, and i’m trying to socialize more by myself since a lot of the times when i do socialize with people it’s because of a close mutual friend, it’s never me talking with them one on one (unless close friend)because i don’t want to be judged by them, or for them to think i’m weird. I’m trying to learn how to do things on my own and improve my speaking/social skills.

Next class was good since i had a friend, then lunch and i realized all of my friend group was split lunches, except me and my rlly close friend. I didn’t mind, but i wonder if she minded being just with me. We did find a place to sit but the people around me i don’t have a good history with so we moved and i felt bad for her i case she didn’t like it. 

Next period, i had a math class, and its honors. (This is my first year deciding to take honors because a part of me believes i can do it) I feel like i don’t deserve to be in there, i don’t have any friends and everyone just seems higher and smarter than me. We had to do a paper where we had to find people across the room to fill in certain hobbies on the page. I found it really hard to fill it and when people asked me i just felt incredibly awkward and out of place.

Last period, It is also honors. I believe it was the worst one, i have a lot of friends in this class but i stayed silent the whole entire time, there was this girl next to me who has a mutual friend with me, she was talking to the ppl behind me and was trying to include me in the conversation but i shut it down by just saying one word responses because i didn’t want her to think i was awkward or i am not worthy of being anyone’s friend.

1mkwb2o,Is there any hope ?,"I’m 22 years old, male, and I’ve been struggling with social anxiety for several years.
For me, this means that in many social situations I feel intense awkwardness and a constant fear that others will judge me negatively. I often think that I will seem boring, uninteresting, or that I have nothing meaningful to contribute to a group.
Even when I’m among people I want to get to know better, I feel as if there is a “wall” in front of me. My mind starts overanalyzing every move and every word. I think: Did I say something stupid? Do I seem weird now? Why is no one laughing at my joke?
The result? Many times I stay silent, smile mechanically, and then leave with a feeling of disappointment — as if I had a chance to connect, but didn’t take it.
I’ve tried small steps, like talking more, asking others about themselves, staying longer at social events instead of leaving quickly — but the anxiety and self-criticism are always there.

I work in a public front desk position. My coworkers and I do a lot of processing of materials. It’s really quiet work. I’ve found that working in dead silence exasperates my anxiety, and I physically cannot handle the silence because my brain tells me silence = my coworkers hate me (I know this isn’t true). So I fill the silence… with quiet conversation. 

However, what happens is word vomit. I can’t stop it once it’s a formulated thought. I’ll talk about anything and everything. I am so worried that my coworkers are going to start disliking working with me because of this. I’ll even repeat my stories word for word in front of coworkers I’ve already told the story to. I don’t know how to keep it in and/or tone it down. Does anyone have any tips for how to stop my thoughts from pouring out???

I should finish up with the fact that I’m not completely incapable of being silent. I can do it. But my brain is going a thousand miles an hour about why my coworkers rarely initiate conversations and if it’s me not them that’s the problem. And then my mouth opens and I have to say something.

1mk8cst,Just having the anxiety itself makes people interpret you differently.,"Everyone slips up, makes mistakes, but the anxiety makes you dwell and waste time on each one. You isolate yourself (at least, I did). Then before you know it, your teens are gone. Same with 20s, 30s etc. So the snowballing effect it has on every life sphere is bad enough, but tbh, just having the anxiety and it being palpable I feel is the worst. The anxiety drastically changes how people perceive you, especially these days I feel.

This is going to sound crazy, but I feel people will subconsciously forgive a lot as long as someone is social and not anxious about it. The anxiety itself feels like the biggest social sin, and of course over time people who know of you will develop a bias about you, and not in the good way. 

I didn't realize how humiliating just having the anxiety was. And trust me...it is. Almost any social blunder and screwup seems to be washed away as long as the person is extroverted enough. But if you're someone who keeps to themselves/is uncomfortable around people? Yeah, that's a horrible road to go down, and unless you move you're somewhat screwed. I hope I'm wrong, and maybe with enough sustained effort people will change their opinion. But I dunno. I'm depressed and don't know what the answer is.

1mkjekd,Numbness,"For as long as I've been conscious, it's always been my lifes goal to be as social/interesting/well connected as possible. I always wanted to be that one person everyone liked or got along with or could make anybody talk or laugh. I spend nearly every waking moment of my day either training myself with scenerios in my head or analyzing conversations that either worked really well or weren't my best work so I could do better. Words don't come very easy to me and I hate the way my voice sounds so a lot of simple interactions just become an overwhelming mess for me.

I started getting really self conscious about things around middle school when I noticed I didn't really have something to say like I always used to. I'd been called annoying or weird before, but back then it started to hurt because this was around the time where kids start getting cliquy and the social hierarchy became important, so I tried being more careful. Whenever I got too comfortable, I became a characature, and my friends and other kids would see me as a laughing stock rather than a person. I didn't want to experience that once I got to college, so I became a nervous, awkward wreck around people I didn't know or wasn't comfortable with. I was really focused on being this person that everyone liked and I lost a lot of myself in the process.

Fast forward to now, if you asked most people about me, I'm sure they'd say I'm a nice person or cool to talk to. I wouldn't say I'm particularly hilarious; I play a lot of my jokes safe so that 1) I can guarentee a laugh or at least a chuckle so I don't beat myself up for making things awkward and 2) not to offend or annoy cause I've done that a lot in the past and its turned off a lot of people. A lot of my interest is faked and I ask questions just to ask questions; not because I care. Same things go with my laughs; I do it so things aren't awkward. It feels like I don't really have connection with anybody. Just good theatrics when I have the energy for it.

I don't think I have a particularly niche sense of humor but its not that uncommon for me to stutter or jumble up my words, so my jokes don't land that well. With a lot of the ""success"" I have socializing, I feel really tired and numb at the end of the day knowing most of what other people see is a facade that isn't even all that well built. Even when I do try to relax and train myself to be in the moment and not act, I feel like I don't really get a lot out of my socializing. I just don't find things that funny or I find myself zoning out. What's the most annoying about this all is that it wasn't always this way and I used to actually look foward to going out. Now, I feel like I need to hype myself up and focus on trying to have a good day instead of just having one. I think I like the idea of having friends and going out but when I actually do, it just doesn't feel as enjoyable as it could be. The only time things feel good is when I'm drunk or when I tried out my friends stims, but those are obviously not sustainable.

I just started a new job and I’m really struggling with severe anxiety, numbness, and social disconnection. It’s making it very hard to focus and function at work. The hours are long and the pressure is overwhelming.

It’s not just the job. My mental health has been bad for a long time, even before I started working. I took this job so I can finally afford therapy.

The good news is after 3 months, I’ll get 2 remote workdays per week, which will give me time to finally start therapy. But right now, I feel like I’m just surviving and barely holding on.

I know antidepressants don’t always work, and if they do, it can take time for them to start helping. Sometimes they even make things worse before they get better. Honestly, I wanted to try therapy first, but my situation feels too overwhelming right now. I need some external support.

Since joining, I have had a majority of my expectations let down and am seeing the reality of the BS that is the military. I'm not going to go into how there are pros and cons, at the end of the day I have had some aspects fulfilled but for other aspects such as the military demeanor and social aspects, I don't relate with whatsoever. 

I'm a more quiet and reserved person, a bit of an introvert until I get to know people I am comfortable with. That being combined with my disappointment and frustration of being in the military simply results in me not trying to talk to my room mate, for anything other than maintenance or the room and stuff. It also results me in not talking to a single soul at the gym unless it is for gym stuff. I hardly mingle with any women romantically. I have zero friends minus work associates. 

For the social stuff, I have had history of having friendships and relationships where it didn't end happily for me, so I feel like that plays a role in my isolation as well. I isolate myself from military people because they have also given more drama. Dealing with people has also felt like it took so much energy for me. I have felt peace in my solitude, but now it feels like I want to branch out more.

Going to a cafe for example. You walk in, get in the queue, order your drink and sit down. While there are other people present, the only necessary interaction is straightforward and transactional. I know almost exactly what to expect so my mind doesn't really see this situation as something to fear.

Compare this to having conversations and personal interactions. The whole point of interacting with others is that you don't know what they're going to do or say, their mind is independent of yours after all.

i think the reason for why i have this social anxiety now is because during sophomore year i delusionally thought that my friends at the time and the people around me had sinister intentions, and was after me in some way. i felt extremely disconnected from everyone around me. even though the reality of it was i was scaring people away and making them uncomfortable with the way i acted, and found out a year later my friends were all just really concerned for me. now that i’m better, i think all of those delusional thoughts are now just social anxiety and nervousness to talk to people around me.

i’m comfortable with people older and younger than me, but i haven’t been around people my age since sophomore year. today there was a pop up at my new school to pick up t shirts and stuff before school, i went and there were many people my age around me. i got nervous and was just really shy. i wasn’t there longer than 20 minutes and was rushing to leave. afterwards, i went to a smoothie place and there were tons of students who were there as well, just hanging out with one another. i couldn’t face them, and was focusing on the ground in front of me and my hands the whole time. then, and for 30 minutes afterwards, i started sweating, and felt like i had to vomit, and had to hold back doing it. once i left, i was having a bunch of thoughts right after the other, like “i feel like i can’t breathe” “i have to throw up” “this feels like it could lead into a panic attack” i stopped feeling nauseous an hour later but still felt wired.

i want to get use to being around people my age again, and make friends again because i miss doing stuff w friends, but my body and mind set me back in these moments by going through a cycle of anxiety.

i know in my mind the people around me are just people around me, but my body has this response on its own, and it makes it hard to control my mind at that point. i didn’t have a panic attack, but this was from being around people my age for 40 minutes. what happens on monday when i have to be around them for 7 hours and talk to them? i’m scared i will have panic attacks again, even though i’m not using the drugs that induced it anymore, my body could remember it as a response, and i don’t know what to do about that or how to manage my social anxiety. please help me out, thanks.",1754585655.0,3,0,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mkesks,Has anyone tried the method I saw in a video to break anxious thought patterns?,"Recently, I came across a YouTube video in which the creator explained how to use ChatGPT in conjunction with Byron Katie's self-inquiry process, The Work, to escape anxious thought spirals.  
  
It basically consists of four questions you ask yourself, which ChatGPT can help you with if you'd like:  
  
Is it accurate?  
  
Is it possible for you to be certain that it is true?  
  
When you believe that thought, how do you respond?  
  
Without that thought, who would you be?  
  
After that, there's a phase known as the turnaround, in which you reverse the idea and search for instances where the opposite could be true.

 The man in the video gave the following example:  
  
""I would have been better off not doing the presentation, and it will fail.""  
Through the questions, he also discovered that the thought was freezing him more than the circumstance.  
  
Although I haven't tried it yet, it seemed like a pretty powerful tool, especially the way AI used voice mode to gently challenge his beliefs in real time. Compared to simply repeating affirmations or attempting to ""calm down,"" it appeared to be far more effective.

I’ve been working remotely for the past few years, better pay led me to moving away from roommates into my own place. Me, my partner, and about a dozen friends all moved to a new city last year.

I was really looking forward to making new friends. I’m involved in the music scene, am a musician, and I just can’t get words to come out of my mouth. I’ve been introduced to this great group of new folks that I want to be friends with, but I’m so damn awkward. I can’t just start up conversation past “how’s it going,” it seems IMPOSSIBLE to me. What do I say? Compliment someone? How do I keep the conversation moving? Idk. It’s like my social meter has gone from 90 to 10. I just don’t know how to do it anymore and it makes me sad.

One of my friends said I seem intimidating because I play music and have a cool creative job and my own place. I’m almost 30 and most of the people around me don’t have the same luck on the job end of things. It makes me feel shitty when most of them talk about hating their job, not making any money. Conversationally I don’t know what to add.

Idk I was just at a party last night and can’t seem to get past “how’s it going.” Questions or even just conversational flow isn’t happening for me, when I’ve usually been warm and kind and easy to talk to. I just lately feel like everyone feels awkward around me. It’s been a year of this. I had a close family member take their own life in January, partially due to social anxiety, and I often think of them in these situations. Why is it so paralyzing to me all of the sudden.

Even with friends I used to just do bits with all day, I seem to have lost touch with my playful side. I used to be able to get along with anyone, I’m really struggling lately to connect with friends, people who are closest to me.

so... where do i start? i guess it's getting licensed to drive. but after that, what job wants someone my age with no experience? for obvious reasons i'd rather work from home, but i have no certifications and no quiet/private area to conduct work in. for now i'm considering a basic job at like a kroger or some other grocery store, preferably stocking but anything at this point.

for those that work or have worked somewhere like that or walmart, how does the interview/hiring process go? i assume they teach you what to do, but can you please share how your first days went and how long it took you to feel comfortable with the job? not with the social aspect necessarily, but the actual work.

i feel so embarrassed to be where i am though i know i'm the only person that put me in this place. i am on medication for depression but not seeing a therapist. i've tried in it the past and it didn't feel very helpful. my primary doctor has strongly encouraged me to find one again though, but since i'm on state insurance it's difficult to find many people that accept it in my area. i would consider one online but again, the privacy issue makes that hard.

1mjuhai,Social anxiety is ruining my life and future. I'm ready to change — but I don’t know where to start.,"Hi friends,  
I’m not even sure how to begin this post. My issue feels so complicated, layered, and confusing that even I can’t fully understand it. But I do know one thing: I don’t want to keep living like this.

I’m a medical student, and as you might expect, med school comes with constant social demands — presentations, teamwork, hospital rounds, speaking in front of others. These things suffocate me.

Sometimes, just knowing I have an upcoming presentation or group activity makes me unable to sleep for days. The anxiety eats me alive. My brain stops working properly — I can’t think, sleep, or feel calm.  
It even gets to the point where I feel anxious watching **someone else** present — even if I’m not the one speaking!

This has destroyed me academically.  
I’ve failed courses **only** because of this.  
I avoid research opportunities because they require presenting. I skip summer training programs because I’d have to interact with others. I dodge medical conferences that require me to speak or be seen.

The result? My academic record is empty — no research, no training, no experiences. This makes others — institutions, doctors, even classmates — assume I’m lazy, stupid, or unworthy of any opportunity.  
But I’m **not** stupid. I’m just trapped by a phobia of the very things required to “succeed” in this field.

Ironically, I’ve excelled in personal, solo skills — like animation, design, coding.  
But for reasons I don’t understand… I’m not socially anxious **in every situation**.  
Sometimes I can be totally fine in a group setting. I can say hi to people without issues. Even when I walk into a room late, I feel a bit nervous at first but it fades quickly.

Why is it that I panic in one social situation but feel fine in another? It makes no sense. It’s like being scared of the dark… but totally okay with walking through a dark cave!

I want to **change**. I want to get better. I want to get rid of this fear.  
I want to be successful — because deep down, I know I can be. I’m **not** a failure.

I think there are other things feeding my depression too — like how I feel about my appearance (hair, teeth, weight, clothes, smell…).  
Yet I see people who have it way worse, but walk around with confidence that touches the sky!

So tell me, friends:

* Where do I start?
* Has anyone here gone through something similar and come out stronger?
* Should I begin with cutting porn? Masturbation? Junk food? The gym?
* Do those really make a difference?

(For context: I’ve had a long history of porn & masturbation — 2–3 times daily for the past 3–5 years.)

I’m ready to trust whatever advice you give me, even if it sounds weird or irrational.  
I’m desperate for a new path. I want to change. Please help me.",1754555122.0,3,1,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mjgs72,You all wanna talk about social anxiety? Let me tell you...,"TW: SH. I'm about to turn 23 soon. When I got out of high school I realized there was something off: my discomfort with socializing was worse than I thought. I never applied to colleges because I was too scared to ask about financial aid so I gave up on the idea all together.

It took me a whole year to muster up the courage to get a job in retail. My coworkers would bully me because I would rarely talk. The anxious feelings were so overwhelming that when I'd take my Lunch I would lock myself in a restroom stall refusing to eat and instead find comfort in a blade. 

The irony is that job was the one I was able to last the longest in: 5 months. I would've stayed too if I hadn't hurt my hand while on the clock. My sister told me to just quit and not give my two weeks which is what I did. This is where I picked up a really unhealthy habit: quitting with no notice.

In the span of 5 years I've worked in 11 different places. Only in one of those jobs did I give my two weeks. It was and has been so mentally draining and exhausting trying to maintain a job. Every time I quit I am filled with great shame because what does that have to say for me? Surely that I'm a coward who's terrified of living in a world where socializing is required.

There are times where I can forget about my social anxiety temporarily because of this strange feeling I get sometimes, I call it the ""too dead to care"". I can order food without getting shaky, ask questions wherever and whenever I need to. The only other time I am able to forget about my social anxiety is when I'm doing favors for others, or when I'm with people I know.

I feel like instead of progressing I'm regressing. Today, marks the end of my 11th job in which I only lasted 4 days. The sad part about it is how low I've fallen with excuses to give my family about why I quit. But let me tell you all what I did to get out of this job. 

I arrived at work, sat in my car and was about to have another mental crisis because I seriously didn't want to clock in. The debate I had with myself didn't take very long. I powered off my phone, started the car, and drove around with no direction for a while. Then I went to Starbucks, ordered a Mocha Cookie Crumble, drove to a nearby park and spilled it on myself. When I arrived home I invented this insane story about how an angry customer had thrown coffee at me. They believed me. I didn't know that social anxiety could turn a person into such a good liar.

She cut my hair way short than I showed her on my phone, but it didn't look terrible (my hair grows fast anyway). I was worried that she thought that I wasn't happy because I didn't smile (that's because I slept onIy two hours last night). 

Normally I don't talk to barbers because I'm terrified to speak, but what I said to my barber was maybe the worst thing I could've said. I told her: ""Don't get me wrong, I'm not unsatisfied with my haircut, I'm just sleep deprived, it looks amazing"". That's it. She smiled at me and said thanks.

1mjitul,Today I gave my first presentation in front of my classmates.,"It was the last period of the day in Advanced Spanish. I’ve always been good at it — that’s the only reason I am even in that class. But knowing the material was never the problem. Speaking was.

Since I started at that school, no one had ever heard my voice. Barely in class and during group work, not even reading a line out loud. Nothing. Since third grade, I’d only spoken in whispers or in the lowest voice posible. And only when I had no choice or want to tell something to the teacher or my opinion.

Today, without warning, the teacher announced we were doing an oral exam. Just like that. Two students went first. Then it was my turn.

She looked at me. Not in a harsh way: just expectantly. I looked back. Two seconds passed. I didn’t say anything. It wasn’t awkward, but in my head, I was thinking: “Am I really going to do this?”

I took a breath. And I started talking.

I didn’t whisper. I didn’t hesitate. I just spoke. It came out naturally , just like I was talking to my sister at home. Calm, steady. The part that surprised me the most was that I didn’t freeze. I didn’t go blank. I didn’t start rambling. And most importantly: my voice didn’t crack. Not even once. No voice breaks. No “gallos”. It came out clean.

I could only look at the teacher. I forgot everyone else. If I looked away, I knew I’d lose focus. So I stayed locked on her.

I gave my thoughts on the Kafka book. It wasn’t a recycled opinion or something I picked up from the others. It was just how I saw it. Honest, direct. And saying it out loud made me realize it actually made sense — even more than I expected.

When I finished, the teacher didn’t just nod and move on. She said everyone had liked my comment. That it stood out. She said that she was Proud and her face confirms it.

That hit me harder than I expected, because she wasn’t even my regular teacher. I only knew her from homeroom. But still — she, and probably everyone else, knew I never spoke like that. Never interacted with anyone. Some of them did not even know my voice.

And now, not only did I speak for the first time — I did it well. No acting. No panic. Just me saying something real. And it worked.

Now I feel bad and not because I was wrong, it's giving me anxiety attacks and laughter, I never imagined speaking so easily and with such normality. I am someone who admits what I have and I am not ashamed to say it, I understand and affirm that I have social anxiety, easily gets angry, stress, panic, etc, but this step was a great achievement for me, I had never done this before and my face is now pink.",1754519375.0,5,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

It was a quiet job and since I was one of the younger employees, I didn’t get much opportunity to socialize or gain confidence. Most of my communication went through just one person (my senior) so I didn’t get much broader experience.

Now that job position no longer exists and now I’m trying to find a similar role. I’ve had a few interviews, but I find myself overthinking every conversation afterward. I keep replaying things in my head, wondering if I said something wrong or if I should’ve responded differently. It honestly ruins the rest of my day sometimes and I feel embarrassed, especially when someone close to me points out things I “shouldn’t have said.”

Also I’ve noticed that whenever I talk to someone new especially in interviews, my heart starts racing, my body shakes, and I struggle to get the words out properly. I sometimes stutter or lose track of what I was trying to say, which makes me even more nervous in the moment. It’s frustrating because I know what I want to say, but my nerves get in the way.

English is my second language, and I know some of my answers sound a bit unnatural, even though I’m trying really hard to improve. But this phase of life trying to build a career, speak more confidently, and adjust to a new world, feels very overwhelming.

If anyone else has been through something similar, or has advice on how to build more confidence with interviews and communication (especially when English isn’t your first language), I’d truly appreciate hearing it.

1mjj5ib,What prevents a spiral from getting worse?,"I've been working to prevent my anxiety attacks in the past, but occasionally they seem to strike without warning. After a brief period of stress, I have a complete mental breakdown and start overanalyzing everything, including relationships, work-related issues, and even random memories from the past.

I recently discovered a technique that involves typing straightforward, soothing commands into an AI like ChatGPT, such as 

""I'm spiraling, help me breathe.""

 Surprisingly, this practice actually made me slow down and feel a little more grounded.

Have any of you tried anything similar?

Or do you have mental ""reset buttons,"" phrases, routines, or personal tools that you use when things start to get out of control?

1mjj0xj,I'm stuck in the small talk stage with my crush,"I (21f) have a crush on my classmate (21m). Have had a crush on him for the past 4 years. Two years ago we were grouped up for a uni project which was how we talked for the first time (kinda never imagined we'd ever talk so it was BIG) and from then on we had a few small talks. 5 or 6 in the span of two years and the occasional exchange of pleasantries. Two initiated by me through texts (ended up being embarrassingly short for the effort it took to psych myself up) and the rest by him irl. And I feel like we would've talked more if I wasn't so awkward. And the fact that I find myself avoiding him for the fear of him ignoring me or having awkward eye contact. Which may be kinda rude on my part but I can't help it

Now, thing is. I wanna talk to him more, cause that's typically how people get close. Where my anxiety comes to play besides making my brain go blank, is making me feel like he (and people in general) will hate me after I open my mouth. And at the same time I'm not a very approachable person.

My crush on him goes into hibernation when we're not talking (which is most of the time) but when he once in a blue moon talks to me, it comes back in full swing and it revives my hope. But is immediately followed by the thought ( is he just a nice guy or would he like to talk to me?) And it leaves me hesitant to try to get closer.

I wouldn't say he's an overly popular person. In the means that he doesn't talk to just anyone. He usually sticks with his friends group and a handful of other people. Which AGAIN leaves me hopeful that maybe he's not talking to me just because he's a nice chatty guy.

Anyways, the POINT is we're seated next to each other this month and I feel like it's my last chance to get closer to him And after typing all of this I do realize the solution is a simple as ""just talk to him"" but I can't overcome the anxiety and the fear of rejection

1mjhwpb,Old friend asking for money?,"So i made a friend in university who was initially fun to be around. However, as I got to know him better and understand his personality a bit more, I realised that he was toxic. Everytime we had a converation, he would just disagree with everything I said and he would turn it into a debate/argument. I stuck around with him throughout university because I didn't want to look like a loner sat with no friends in lectures etc. Also, I'm terrible at making friends anyway so the fact that i had  someone to hang out with was a miracle. It seemed like he argued more when it was just us 2 alone; when we were with 3 or more people, his personality substantially changed. He was much more kind and supportive as a good friend should be for some odd reason.

So eventually he moved to a different city to start a new masters course but we still kept in touch online. Then, one day we had a huge argument and I just blocked him because I simply had enough.

2 years later , I decided to unblock him as I felt maybe I was being too harsh on him. Then a few days ago, he messaged me to ask how I was doing and it was like he never acknowledged that we had a huge debate and I blocked him. I really needed someone to talk to and I thought maybe he would have changed, so I should give him another chance. Maybe i can get a good friend out of this...

Then a few days later he asked me if he could borrow some money from me. I was really confused because why would I just randomly lend him money when we haven't spoken for over 2 years? But at the same time I need a friend and I don't want to be rude by declining. Although it seems maybe he contacted me just because he wanted money rather than trying to be my friend again ?

She said this because she caught me sleeping at 3pm in the day. I just calmly defended myself and tried to tell her that I’m fine and that my sleep schedule is messed up. She’s an extreme extrovert so it’s unfathomable to her that somebody could enjoy being alone. I do enjoy being alone and it’s not because of my anxiety. I’m not anxious around my mom but I still do not care about socialising with her. But this rant she went on made me never want to talk to her again.

The only people I really interact with are my immediate family and a small group of friends. I do not like being around people.

I have a boyfriend so I am so fucking glad I don't have to date anymore. He's the only person in my life who understands how I feel.

I simply do not understand why my dad has such an enthusiasm for people.

I don't have a job, and I don't want one either, because I despise people. The only time people talked to me as a child was to either piss me off, or to pry their noses where it was none of their fucking business. I didn't owe anyone anything then and I certainly don't now. Fuck people.

When people with dogs come up to me I pretend to be interested so I can pet their dogs. Dogs like me. They don't judge.

My dad suggested doing charity work, and I have. The problem is I can't relate to them.

I hate raising my voice, I avoid any conflict, and I don't know how to stand up for myself. This should be a positive quality, but people are really cruel when someone is very ""passive,"" and they literally take advantage of you. I think the world tends to treat shy people very badly, even if they don't hurt anyone and are afraid of people.

1mj31ss,Crippling Social Anxiety at Work,"Hi everyone, 

For the past 5 years I (27m) have been dealing with crippling social anxiety pretty much exclusively in the workplace. As soon as I step foot into any job I feel an extreme pressure in my chest, my whole body becomes tense and my appetite completely vanishes and won't come back for days. 

I usually work as a chef, but I've also tried pick packing in a warehouse. No matter where I work it's always the same: 

I spend most of my time at work unable to stop worrying that other people hate me, that I'm being unintentionally rude to them, or that I'm just being really weird. Then I go home and spend the entire night unable to stop replaying the events of the day, and the conversations I had, over and over in my head looking for mistakes I made. I usually go to bed without eating because I can't even think about food at that moment. I lie awake for hours ruminating, until I force something down and fall asleep with a few hours left before I have to wake up. Then the next day I wake up tired and still stressed about the things I was thinking about the night before. 

I've gone through 5 jobs in the last 5 years, 2 of them only lasting a month, the latest one only a couple of days before it just got too much and I left. 

I don't know what to do at this point, I can't stay on my countries unemployment payments forever and they just barely cover the cost of surviving, but I can't handle the constant state of panic and fear I experience in the workplace. A stay at home job would probably fix this problem, but it isn't possible in either of the fields I've worked in.

I’ve come to understand the origins of this fear, and why it has attached itself to my back; weighing tons and pulling me down while I traverse uphill. My subconscious, juvenile brain has not experienced social security; ever so unrequited and insecure, this was my destiny. We as humans are predisposed to craving human connection/ intimacy and being rejected from that, being made a pariah meant death and solitude. My fears of social rejection was not without reason but without direction. I’ve severed ties, burned bridges, dissociated from what makes me who I am in an effort to become more “socially acceptable”. I should’ve allowed myself my own connections with who I was instead of being dismissive. Because now I don’t know who I am; I don’t know what to say and how to say it.

a soft moment in the noise.

I gave nothing.
No smile.
No nod.
No warmth.

all I want
is a conversation.
One word.
One laugh.
One glance that lingers. This social fear I experience is powerful. And I can only hope to not become a pariah by my own doing. This fear only comes off as rudeness, and it’s clear that I am taken as a person who is “disinterested” or “uncaring” when I only try my best to be more and unafraid.

1miyxuv,Conversation and friendship skills," am a college sophomore , pretty soon about to start living in same apartment with my peers. These peers atleast one of them literally chose me first and I feel like he does feel good about me, and the rest of boys all know each other. However I am usually shy , calm and find very hard to start conversations with any one. When we 4 met during summer , I just could not talk anything but simply heard what they were talking and answered for any direct questions to me. My parents were around and tried to help me initiate but I just feel lost and sometimes I feel scared about whatever I say being judged and that they may laugh at me. My parents are worried how I will be with them in a room and if I will be left out. I end up staying quiet 90% of the day even in general and we are all worried about the next steps of college, academics etc. Any mentors or coaches anyone has tried for this or any suggestions please?

1mi7fo7,I wish my teen years were fun.,"I was always a child that wasn't good with people. Interacting with people was a huge deal to me, and I tried my best to avoid them. I've always struggled with making friends, and even though I was able to talk normally, they'd find me weird and just stop hanging out with me. I would often talk to people who were considered ""weird"" (they were actually good people, but i wanted to have a big friend group and we werent close anyway). I actually could talk (a little) easily to people until I hit 13. Worst years of my life began, I became extremely socially anxious and I had stopped talking to people after my only friend left. People in my class never really liked me either and I kept on isolating myself. I never had online friends so I was basically alone until 17. I somehow made friends but they would never hangout with me, they'd just talk to me online. My anxiety got worse and I dropped out of several schools (from when i was 14 to 18). I have some good friends now but they dont live close to me so we cannot meet up or anything. I always wished for a normal teen life, like hanging out with your friends after school, going to malls, sleepovers, all that stuff you know? and now it's too late, I wish I had a better life, I wish things had been normal for me.",1754395810.0,99,12,socialanxiety,anxiety

I’d love to know how you guys manage to make daily conversations feel fresh, fun, or comforting. Do you play games, share stories, or just talk about your day in detail?

1mikw28,I Despise my family,"I seriously actually hate my family. This isn't a new thing either, I've always hated them. My dad abused me when I was a kid and my mom is a neglectful alcoholic but that's not even what I hate the most about them. They're just completely hypocritical, selfish, narcissistic, delusional, ignorant, Troglodytes. They just can't ever see things from someone else's view, like they just refuse to even with all the facts right there in front of them. 

Like today I tried explaining all the censorship laws being put in place over in Europe and how obviously bad they are for basic human rights like freedom of speech, religion etc. and they just immediately shot me down and agreed with what's being done. (Which is literally the biggest red flag ever no matter what side ur on politically, like it's an actually  fascist view) And there reasons for this were so incredibly childish. Stuff like 
""Well social media bad for you"" or ""well people should go out more"" which yes I somewhat agree with but those are far from valid reasons to censor the entirety of the Internet. They even acted as if my point was invalid because I get my news from the Internet and use the Internet often. Like am I the only one who thinks that's objectively the dumbest shit ever? 

And that's just the most recent example but it's like this with literally everything. Like how I tried to explain to my father that rizz is in the dictionary. Just thought it was a fun conversation topic. But he (as always) immediately shot me down and said ""maybe the urban dictionary"" and I kept trying to explain noooo the real dictionary. I even pulled that shit up on Google went to the official Oxford dictionary site and he still denied it. And what was his reasoning? Because HE personally doesn't think it's a word, and it therefore isn't. And he has the gall to say I'm the narcissist who always has to be right. Even thought I've never heard him apologize or admit he was wrong once in my life except to my mother. (Who's the exact same btw) 

I'm just actually done with them. And I would move out but I'm a 20yo mentally disabled man with a GED and no work experience. And it's not like I'm not looking for a job I've applied to probably 7 different places in just the last 2 weeks. And the one job I did actually get I was let go from before I even started training cuz I got pneumonia for 3 weeks. (Which somehow my dad still blames me for) They just don't get it at all and they never ever try too. They say they do but then immediately shoot me down whenever I try to explain how I feel or how I think calling me an idiot or a loser, and that my opinions don't matter cuz I don't have a real life like they do. Sometimes I just genuinely want to kill them and be done with it. Sorry for the rant it's just actually the only way I don't end up in jail. ",1754426819.0,3,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

1miq1sv,Terrified of losing new friends,"I recently made a new group of friends. I finally feel like I’ve found my tribe but I’m terrified of messing it all up. 

A long time ago, I had a really bad experience where a whole group of friends turned on me while at uni and I experienced some bullying. They cornered me and told me all the things they didn’t like about me after acting like my friends. I don’t think I did anything wrong in particular - just think they decided they didn’t like me and that was that. 

Even now over 10 years later this sticks with me and it’s the most frustrating thing which I’m concerned is holding me back. Every message I send to my new friends is overthought, I always worry I’ve done something wrong after we’ve spent time together (even though everything goes really well) I’m done with being stuck in this cycle.  

I’ve been in therapy before and have discussed this issue, but I still get that niggle in my head that one day these new friends are going to turn round and do exactly the same as my old uni friends. Rationally I know this is very unlikely and it’s unfair on my new friends to think this way. 

Has anyone been in this situation and has there been any way you’ve managed to shake it off? I don’t want to push anyone away with my constant worrying.

As a master's student in Business Intelligence and Information Systems, I'm getting frustrated with the CS and IT fields' obsession with interview skills.

And to top it off, there's this constant fear-mongering that you'll be left behind if you don't keep up with the latest trends or perfect your interview game. I mean, I believe I'm neurodivergent who really hate this game of interviewing where recruites lie to the candidate about the job description and the candidate lie and tend to over react about the small achievement in which I don't see that great, and this whole thing feels like a nightmare. It's like the industry is designed for people who love hearing themselves talk and can effortlessly BS their way through client meetings. I'm tired of the ""you'll be left behind"" mentality .

I’ve been going to the gym alone for a while now, and it’s been helping me slowly get better with my anxiety.

  


Recently, my sister offered to start coming with me. She’s super supportive and even said she can pick me up on her scooter so we can go together. I know she genuinely wants to help and be part of my progress, which is amazing.

  


But I’m honestly scared of what people around might think or say. The area I live in is kind of judgmental, and I’m worried that random guys near the gym will assume she’s my girlfriend or something and start making comments, teasing, or gossiping. They obviously wouldn’t know she’s my sister.

  


I hate that this kind of fear is even stopping me from doing something so normal. But it’s making me feel very anxious and overthink everything. I don’t want to disrespect her support, but I also don’t want to be in a situation where I’m being laughed at or judged.

I couldn’t eat at school because I feared people judging my food. I couldn’t walk without holding something in my hand. I couldn’t laugh without covering my face. Going to the stores was a nightmare. Making calls was a nightmare. Public speaking assignments filled me with dread. 

I tried everything. Hypnotism videos on YouTube. Subliminal messaging. I couldn’t afford therapy. It was only after Covid that my SA WENT. It was also the year I had started yoga. And I read the book “a new earth”. I still don’t know if any of this had to do with my SA going. After that I’d say I was just shy. Not to the point that it affected my daily life. I can never explain how freeing it is. It truly is everything. I truly believed that I would never get rid of SA. Because that’s what Google tells you too.

1mhrbti,Using psilocybin to help treat social anxiety?,"Long time coward here, I've heard a lot about people using psychedelics and experiencing life-changing effects on their mental health. A lot of research has been conducted on psilocybin in recent history, and I believe the general gist of their conclusions is that psychedelics seem to induce a neuroplasticity that is capable of rewriting previously learned behavior. So, for something like social anxiety, which is in large part a learned behavior, it could be a transformative therapeutic aid. Naturally, if not done carefully, one could wind up reinforcing negative behaviors since you're in a state of ""hyper-learning"". Unfortunately, all this is still in the research phase, so there isn't anywhere I can go to do any sort of psychedelic therapy in a controlled setting. Which is why I am looking at taking things into my own hands. 
 
I would like to try using psilocybin to treat my social anxiety in a more careful, intentional way. I figured I would start by easing myself into it by starting with small doses, so I can become more comfortable with the experience and prevent myself from going through a bad trip.

1mhsqrg,"Long vent post, I’ve had social anxiety for as long as I can remember.","As a toddler, my mother says I didn’t really play with other kids and didn’t make much eye contact. By kindergarten, I had developed selective mutism, which lasted until first or second grade. I got some school support that helped a bit, but I remained very soft-spoken and shy throughout my childhood. I was also extremely passive. I managed to make some friends — though honestly, I think some of them approached me out of pity.

By the time I was around 12, I became more aware of how much this was affecting my life. I suspect I may have developed some mild depression. I hated myself, didn’t know how to talk to people, and was constantly scared. I couldn’t even order food without crying.

Things improved slightly during the pandemic (I noticed that after long breaks away from people, my anxiety becomes more manageable). It was still there, just milder — maybe because everyone was wearing masks and public places were less overwhelming.

But now, it’s come back. I’m able to talk to people, but I’m very quiet and only say the bare minimum. I tend to give one-word answers if I can, rarely ask questions, and struggle to keep conversations going because my mind just blanks out. I have to force myself to think of something to say, and often I just can’t.

It’s also hard to make my voice loud enough — it comes out quiet and sometimes monotone. I mumble occasionally, which leads to people asking me to repeat myself multiple times. That just makes me even more scared to talk.

I also had a few bad experiences in high school where I accidentally said the wrong thing or was called weird, which made my social anxiety worse. I didn’t keep in contact with my friends. I didn’t know how, and I didn’t have the energy.

I find it hard to leave the house. I’ve only worked one job — for a month — that my mom got for me, but otherwise, it’s been really difficult. When I’m in public, I usually have to take my phone out just to distract myself from the people around me.

I’ve never known what it’s like not to live like this. Since I’ve had it my whole life, my social skills are pretty underdeveloped. Even if the anxiety disappeared, I’d still struggle with conversations because I never got to practice. I’m better with written communication, but verbal communication is still a challenge.

One small improvement is that I’m able to make a bit more eye contact now (maybe three seconds looking, one second looking away), but it’s hard to do while speaking.

I’m still just so quiet. I tend to repeat the same few phrases to people: “hello,” “how are you,” “thank you,” “yes,” “no,” “that’s nice.” That probably makes up like 80% of what I say to the average person. I don’t even talk to my parents much, although I do talk to my siblings.

I’ve never been officially diagnosed with social anxiety, even though I’m almost certain I have it. People usually just call it “shyness.” Ironically, what’s stopping me from seeking help is… the anxiety itself. I don’t even know who to go to, and even if I did, I’d be too nervous to make a phone call or speak clearly. I don’t know if I’d be able to explain myself properly to a psychologist.

There’s a lot more I could add, but this post is already so long, and I don’t know if anyone will even read it. If you did, and you’re going through something similar — I’m really sorry. I know how much it sucks.

I’m honestly stressed even posting this, knowing strangers might read it. But I guess it’s a small step toward facing my fears, and the people here know what its like ❤️

1mhub93,19M - Struggling with social anxiety,"
I’m 19 years old. Graduated high school last year. I’m 6’2, around 266 lbs (started the year near 300), so I’ve been slowly losing weight. I’m not ugly face wise, I’m actually decent-looking but I’m still overweight. I live at home, I’m unemployed, and my dad’s transferring the GI Bill (Military Scholarship Sorta) to me so I can hopefully go to college. But mentally… I feel like I’m falling apart.

I have zero friends. Never had a girlfriend. Never had sex. And that shit eats at me every single day. I get stuck imagining a future where I’m 30, alone in an apartment, eating dinner by myself, and sleeping alone forever. It makes me spiral. I’ll cry over it. I break down. And then I just smoke weed, vape my Geek Bar, and numb myself again.

I want a girlfriend so bad. Not even for sex. Just… love A real connection. Someone who knows I exist. I don’t care about being rich or famous. I just want love. But it feels like that’s something I’ll never get. And it’s breaking me.

I’m also dealing with a porn addiction. I started watching it really young and now I can’t go a day without it unless I really try. I think it’s warped how I see women, and I love women and hate what it does to my brain. I want to be better, but I go back constantly. I feel like my brain is fried. 

I also smoke weed pretty much nightly to calm myself down. I don’t party, I don’t drink, I don’t go out. I just get high and watch YouTube or play games until I knock out. It feels like my only comfort at this point. 

p.s. i sweat or pretend to be doing something whenever i feel socially anxious in public. 

I don’t even know where to start. Should I…
	•	Focus just on losing weight?
	•	Get a job to build discipline?
	•	Go to college with the GI Bill?
	•	Try to make friends?
	•	Try to get a girlfriend?
	•	Or just give up and work until I die?

I’m scared I’ll waste my youth. I already feel behind. I know I’m only 19, but I feel like time is running out and I’ll never catch up. I want to feel love, connection, happiness… but I don’t even know who I am anymore. Seeing couples in public feels like a punch in the gut, seeing people smile or show expression feels foreign to me.

If you’ve ever been where I am… or even part of it… please drop advice. I don’t care if it’s tough love or soft support. I just don’t want to be this version of myself forever.

TL;DR:
19M, graduated last year. 6’2, 266 lbs. No friends, no girlfriend, never had sex. I’m attractive but overweight. Addicted to porn, smoke weed nightly, and vape Geek Bars. I live at home. My dad’s giving me the GI Bill so I can go to college. I’m depressed, lonely, and scared I’ll die unloved. Don’t know how to make friends or grow into someone worth knowing. Need direction..

What is some good ways to deflect/autorespond to groups singling you out? 

I am the type of person who quickly feel that banter becomes personal and I am mostly annoyed when I am too much in my head and end up not responding to what others throw at me. Then I can think about it all day and it makes me very bitter and sometimes I even start to avoid that person completely afterwards.

And no, it is not the people I am around - I feel that in all situations, like at work,  nights out, with friends, even family etc. theres is this type of banter that I never really liked (common for some it seems). 

So for example, what could be a good ""autopilot"" response when you sit in a group and someone loudly says something like ""you are a teacher (profession), so off course you should know that"" and everyone looks at you for a response. 

I have had some succes with ""agree and amplify"", but for me that is mostly if I am not inside my head (anxious). 

And also deep down I know the issue comes from my triggers which is related to a deeper sense of wrongness and feeling of not being enough - so when I dont respond and ""give back"" in an appropriate way I just feel humiliated and like i just ""take it"" without responding.

But for the past year or so these have almost exclusively been memories about like social situations I’ve been in that were uncomfortable or embarrassing or whatever. Sometimes they don’t even have to be that embarrassing but the memories feel gross and uncomfortable nonetheless and idk how to deal with it.

Like all I do is just try to push the thoughts away. Sometimes by telling them to just ”shut up” but it’s almost become like a vocal tic because now I just yell at my thoughts to shut up and I can’t really stop doing it like it’s automatic. If I didn’t do these things I’d be stuck with these thoughts and I’d rather not be yk.

Anyways just wondering if other people experience similar things??? :)",1754307582.0,3,2,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mgre2c,it’s hard to keep a conversation going,"It’s humiliating. I’m 23, and for some reason instead of my brain thinking of things to say, I let a conversation get awkward and stale within seconds.

I never know what to say, when to say it, or how to say it; and by the time I’ve chosen what to say, the moment has passed.

After graduating college, I’m managing to hold down my first retail job (FUCKKKK MY LIFE) but communicating with my co-workers (who are all nice!) and the customers I find especially difficult.

Deep down, I know that if I do say something wrong, people will forget it within an hour. But that’s not the problem, the problem is that I WON’T forget. Ever. No matter how hard I try.

I’m just ranting because I was so sure I would grow out of it by adulthood but alas. Here I am. Struggling just as hard as I did at 13.

If it was socially acceptable to never speak again, I would choose that within seconds. But then people would wonder why I’m not speaking and the attention would kill me.

Destined to be awkward I guess. FML.

1mh8co8,Is my anxiety justified? Weird interaction,"Hi everyone. I (24f) am diagnosed with general anxiety and social anxiety. I went to a movie night with friends, where there were a ton of people, like over 20, and I knew about half of them. All ages 15 - 27 and 2 leaders who are like 40 or something. I sat on a couch with my bestie and it was all fun and positive and literally just normal.

The movie ends and my friend got up to talk to someone, and I just stayed on the couch, looking on my phone or something, can't remember. There were 2 people on the couch next to ours with 1 guy and this 1 girl who looked maybe 19 or possibly even younger. Don't know the guys age. I've never seen or spoken to that girl ever before. I was sort of zoned out I guess because I realized she was calling out to me, but I don't know her whatsoever and was zoned out so I didn't notice at first.

She proceeds to say, ""Bro, how old are your shoes?"".

I thought perhaps she was talking to the girl on another couch so I looked away. I also didn't register what the question meant. I've never heard that question before.

She then says, ""Yes, you. How old are your shoes?""

She was pointing and staring at my shoes which are basic white sneakers that I got for super cheap because that's just what I could afford at the time. They're quite tattered and stained but they work and again, it's what I can afford lol. I know they're not super cool but yeah... nothing special about them. They fit me and go with my casual outfits.

I said, ""Maybe a year, not sure"".

She made a weird face with her mouth open and shaped like an O, which I think means she was surprised. I don't understand why this is surprising.

Then she said, ""Those shoes were so popular like wayyyyy back, ages ago.""

I said ""oh, okay"" because I didn't understand the conversation or what the intention was, or if she was trying to be funny? Or being mean? Trying to impress the guy?

Then she said, ""How old are you?""

So I said 24.

Then she makes another weird face and says, ""Oh, makes sense"".

I'm completely baffled. Why did she wait till I was alone to say that, and was she intending to be mean or funny or something else? Her male friend just sat in silence, didn't say anything or smile or laugh.

I felt uncomfortable and confused so I went to the bathroom. 

I had tears come into my eyes due to anxiety over the situation.

I'm not good at deciphering situations and conversations and I'm aware that I can't tell when someone is being mean or bullying me. It's like my brain doesn't register anything. Not sure how else to explain it, but it's always been like this.

Please help me understand what this interaction means and if she was trying to be friendly even? She was speaking quite loudly and her tone was not really friendly or loving, but I understand some people just speak in a ""harsh"" way even when they're being kind.

Am I justified to feel anxious, and was my reaction normal or am I being silly?

Any feedback is so very appreciated.",1754297964.0,4,9,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mh5cve,Im proud of myself but VERY scared.,"Hello! I'm 15 years old and I've been struggling with social anxiety since kindergarten. Long story short I had a bad interaction with a teacher who basically humiliated me in front of the whole class which caused my social anxiety.

For the longest time I've avoided getting help due to the fact that I've had my social anxiety for so long which has resulted in me believing that it has become a part of me. I can't imagine myself without having social anxiety it's something I can't even begin to imagine because not only do I think my social anxiety is a part of me but I also find it strangely comforting. Just like any other disorder my social anxiety has been used as a coping mechanism over the years because with it I was able to completely isolate myself away from the rest of the world and also it's been comforting knowing that I'm struggling because again just like with any other disorder you want to struggle to be seen or struggle as another way of coping so thats what I did for many years.

I've avoided getting help for so long but I finally decided to reach out and I'll be starting therapy in a few days and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. Honestly that's the only reason why I'm making this post because I wanted some advice since I'm truly conflicted. I know I'm making the right decision by getting into therapy but my mind is making me think that I truly don't want to get better and I want to continue struggling because I have been for years. Now I know therapy won't magically make my social anxiety go away but if I continue going it will gradually get better which is scary to me because if I don't have my social anxiety anymore is what I went through all these years really that deep and valid?

I'd also like to mention that I'm scared to see who I become without my social anxiety because I've always identified myself as this unsociable and anxious person but without my social anxiety I know I will truly be different and that is so terrifying because what if I'm a bad person? I feel like that's a crazy thing to say but my social anxiety has saved me many times from speaking my opinions out loud and I know that's a bad trait to have but it's never really been an issue. I feel like it might become one though without my social anxiety and one of my worst fears is to be a bad person and have others perceive me that way. Now maybe that's my social anxiety speaking because I know many people who are confident even with others hating on them which I wish I could be like that but at the same time I don't want people to hate me.

Obviously I'll give therapy a try either way but I'm not sure if it's something I'll continue in the future I'll just have to see how I like it because I'm going to push myself to at least attend for a few weeks! I'm already pushing myself at the moment by posting this because I usually avoid posting things on Reddit or on social media in general so I'm kinda proud of myself for that. Anyways thank you so much for reading this post and if you have any advice for me it'd be very much appreciated! 

Have a great day! 🫶 💕",1754286402.0,7,2,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mh1736,Reddit has helped me face some fears.,"Since i first started posting about my favorite topics on Reddit it has helped me face the ""What will people think about my opinion?"" thing. As whenever you post something you run the risk of getting a mean comment, someone who disagrees with you whether rightfully or not. 

Since i am someone who has no friends and suffers from severe social anxiety, this platform has helped me engage in my favorite topics while practicing a bit about being exposed to whatever anyone might say. 

Of course it is not the same as actually getting out there and facing the world, but this is a nice little hobby for me. I was wondering if this is the same for some others?

 And in my job i had to work for two locations at the same time, for a fairly low salary, taking about 45 minutes to go to one location and 1 hour to the other. My car got broken and I was struggle with money. I had Avoidant personality disorder, anxiety disorders and dystimia.

I 'm 34. It's difficult to make this decision, but from home I would be able to work part-time and continue my projects. I get really overstimulated and i always need loneliness for recharge myself. I would like to radically change jobs, because there are times of the year where I can't survive that type of stress. Someone who had the same issue?

I’m currently 19 and i struggle with social anxiety and depression, i think?? This past year was the first year i was without my family and it was alright in all honesty. All my family asks how my first year of college went and i usually give them all the same answer, a smirk and say it was great or awesome… i sound like such a fun person right? When talking with friends i feel like an outsider because i never know what to say or how to hold the conversation without it becoming too long or weird. With my closer knit friends i have no problem being myself, but it’s when we are in larger settings i struggle to make conversation. So i turn to getting high to get more of my personality back which works, until it wares off and i eventually talk less and less. I used to be able to express myself but after a tramatic childhood i feel like i just shut down and is incapable of expressing how i feel to others, including not being able to get a sense of their feelings/mood if that makes any sense. I also have no emotions, i genuinely can’t get happy like i used to, dying laughing with friends rarely, and it’s nothing against my friends i just feel nothing. When my grandma got cancer, everyone was crying and i felt nothing?? Like how could something so dark, not faze me what so ever. I want to try anti depressants when i go back to college and see if those work, maybe see a therapist to talk about all of this idk. I also want to add that this summer was a rough one to say the least… I really dropped the ball, I got caught cheating in an online course that I had the W from. Then a couple weeks later got fired from my job my uncle helped get me… Just a disastrous end to the summer.I don’t really care if I die at this exact moment, i’m not suicidal but i’m just not scared/ not really bothered with the idea if it happened.

1mh561z,I was followed by a guy,"I need to get this off my chest because it just happened yesterday and iam really scared.
Yesterday I was on a motorcycle with my cousin going around in the city and enjoying the weekend in their city that I dont live on but I was on a visit to my grandma's house. He is a police man and iam just a regular guy. We are both 21 yrs old. The police department called him and he needed to leave me so He left me near my other cousin house in a roundabout that has a sitting area and told me to wait in the roundabout until my uncle's family came back to thier house so that I can spend the night with them. It was near mid night (11:50 pm). I waited in the roundabout for like 10 min and then saw a guy looking at me in a suspicious way. Hes mybe 30 yrs old and looks like hes not from this city. He came and sat next to me and started asking question. Whats your name and where are you from. I told him iam on a visit to my uncle house he said where is the house and i pointed toward a random street, after mybe a min of talking to him I left and said see you later. And went to the city main street so that I can go to a store and ask for help if he followed me, i knew he was up to no good. And i was righ, he started following me and shouting at me to stop. I stoped and asked him ""What do you want?"" He said why aren't you going toward your uncles house that you said was there?, you shouldnt be wandering around alone in the city. Told him THATS NON OF YOUR BUSINESS. and started walking faster. I managed to increase the distance between me and him but he kept on following and starting calling on the phone saying ""we have a guy over here who is alone come and see him"" and also took videos of me walking and said ""they are coming to get you"" I wanna be honest with yall I was scared asf, I started walking even faster and quikly went into a random store and called my police cousin who i just told you about. Told him the full story and he asked me ""is he still following?"" I looked outside and he thankfully left me alone, my cousin told me ""IF YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN CALL ME ASAP"" I said ok and called my dad to come pick me up in the car. 15 min later (I was waiting in the store) my dad came and we went to my uncle house and spend the night there with family. I didnt tell him about what just happened. Called my police cousin and talked about what just happened, he said these guys are probably truck drivers from out of town and they get drunk at knight. Its now the morning of the next day and iam still in shook because of what happened yesterday. I though that only girls get followed and if I ever get in such a situation that I will be brave and use my physical power to beat the hell out of who ever is following me, but the moment it happened to me I got scared, I was afraid that he is a gang member and that i was gonna die. Just to make it clear to yall I live in iraq and this whole thing happened in the small city of Al-dur. This situation got me wandering if iraq is a save place. I hope with pure honesty and from the deepest part of my heart that NO ONE experience what i went through. It doesnt matter wether you are a man or a women You will still get scared.

1mhagwh,What would a wordless comic about social anxiety look like?,"Hi everyone! I'm making a short comic for a contest (5-17 pages) about social anxiety, and I'd love your input! The theme has to be ""dream,"" and dialogue is not allowed (kinda fitting for the topic lol). 

I was thinking about portraying a character with severe SAD whose biggest dream/goal in life is to make friends? Or something simpler like starting the journey to defeating SAD since the plot can't be *too* long and complicated. I'm not quite sure yet. There isn't a lot of media that shows what it's really like to live with social anxiety, so I wanted to make something where people like us can see ourselves in it, and so people without SAD can understand what we go through. 

So, if you were to read a comic about social anxiety and dreams, 
1. What emotions or moments would you like to see?
2. What do you think would feel real/meaningful?
3. Do you have any personal experiences you'd want shown?

I’ve never had a girlfriend, and I don’t really have close friends right now. My social anxiety is bad—I have to seriously psych myself up to even show up. But tonight I pushed myself and went to an LGBT rooftop party alone, hoping maybe I’d meet people, maybe something would click.

At first, I introduced myself to a couple people and we chatted for a bit, played some beer pong, but they already had their group, and I didn’t want to just trail behind awkwardly.

Then I tried to introduce myself to another group of girls. I held out my hand for a handshake—one of them looked at it, made a face, said her name but didn’t shake it. I brushed it off and turned to the next girl, who gave me the back of her hand like I was gross and turned right back to her friend.

I left after that. Sat on a curb for nearly an hour trying not to cry, then took the bus home. I spent around $100 between the event, transportation, and impulsively buying a vape afterward.

1mgwz2b,Intense blushing,"I just came across this subreddit and thought I’d share a tip that worked for me with intense blushing. When I was younger and became anxious or embarrassed my whole face and especially my cheeks would quickly become red. I rarely have this happen anymore and came across a few things that worked for me. I don’t know if these work for others, I just remember being desperate when I struggled with it.

1. Deep breathing or distraction like pinching yourself, sometimes this prevents it from beginning in the first place

2. Laughing along with others. Whenever it happened usually someone would laugh at it but laughing with them rather than trying to quickly divert the conversation worked a lot better. People will usually laugh either way and laughing along makes you ‘in’ it rather than being laughed at. It also calms my nerves and can make the redness lessen

3. If it is a daily occurrence or you know it is going to be a stressful day (ex. presenting in front of others) applying a generous amount of aloe Vera gel or witch hazel in the morning. Honestly I don’t entirely know why it helped but I think it has to do with it providing a cooling sensation, especially when fanning your face while it’s on.

A few years ago I started pushing myself to overcome my social anxiety, and a year ago I pushed extremely hard. All of it was voluntary and of my own decision, no one forced me to do anything. Last year, I got to a level of boldness and success I couldn’t have predicted. I am proud of myself. 

In the middle of September I was motivated and had a lot going on socially. However, there was a sudden moment where I felt my libido (desire for sex) evaporate, and an emotional apathy took its place. I lost a lot of relationships because of this. The many interests and good habits I had (like going to improv and dance classes, meeting friends, dating, exercising, keeping my place clean etc.) became a pointless grind and I gave up on them. 

Since this, my motivation has been to get my libido back, but I did not make much progress. I’ve been going to a therapist, I made lifestyle changes, tried some supplements. I’m a man so I had my hormone levels tested by a specialized men’s clinic and it was in range.

It’s a devastating experience. I felt I was doing everything right. I don’t know for sure that it happened because of the stress. Not sure what more to say but I’m 31 years old.

So they know me as the quiet, barely speaking guy. And im far away from that outside of work once I get to know someone better or even if its just one new person at a time. But a whole group at the office? I was very overwhelmed. Im very talky normally, cracking jokes and I dont overthink what to say.

But due to them seeing me in such a way I find it very hard to change that view now, even if im somewhat more comfortable with them after a year. I still do not speak much at work and I dont feel like myself and cant seem to change it. It feels miserable and im considering quitting and starting anew somewhere else with the intention of showing my personality from the beginning.",1754229124.0,13,1,socialanxiety,anxiety

Everywhere I go I’m reminded that I’m an adult now and should be doing things on my own but I still rely on my parents a lot especially my dad. Social media doesn’t help either. I see people my age driving, living life independently and I feel so stuck and behind. I got my permit at 18 but never followed through. I had bad anxiety, didn’t practice at much, and just stayed home. The first time I went to the DMV with my dad it was crowded, and I overheard a woman judge me for being 18 and just now getting my permit. The guy helping us was rude af! And made me feel like ashamed for having my dad beside me. I was embarrassed and of course ended up failing the test. I came back the next day and luckily had someone nicer helping me. It was less crowded too and I passed. But I still never got my license because of my road anxiety and lack of practice. Now it’s 3 years later and we’re moving to California soon. I have to get my license before we go and I’m terrified. I keep telling myself that « im a grown adult » « im a grown adult » but it makes me feel worse because I don’t feel like one. I still go everywhere with my parents, and I’m ashamed of that. I hate how judgmental people are here in Georgia. I feel like the moment I walk in the DMV again with my dad at 21!!!

1mh0nfd,"I'm so lost on what to do, and the social anxiety is getting in the way.","Im gonna do my best to keep this concise, and i fully anticipate at least some people being very brutally honest, but I dont know what else to do here.

I (M30) have struggled with these things my entire life, they're far far better now, but I have a very clear wall i have yet to pass.

I have zero friends.

I've tried to do things online and attempt to follow up with players in games or users in places like reddit or wherever else, and there's never a lot that comes from that, and im so awkward and anxious it's hard for me to gage if I'm the issue or not. And I of course have no one to consult at all about it.

I can perfectly well take the steps to put myself in situations where I may have opportunity to talk to a new person (i.e. bars, parks, hobby stores, venues for entertainment etc.) But I cannot bring myself to speak to someone unprompted. That seems almost crazy to me. Half of this following thought was surely taught/ingrained in my head over the years, but ""in what world would it be a good idea as a white man to approach anyone let alone a woman that I dont know"" (clarifying I'm not explicitly looking for any particular type of relationship/connection, just any new connections at all)

People talk about banter, flirting, the approaching, meeting people doing things you like, etc. And it all makes me so nervous and confused because I don't know how to engage with any of that at all. I go and do things alone. All. The. Time. And the only interactions I ever get are with employees, and the elderly/older people depending on where I'm at. 

I've tried the friendship functions on dating apps, as well as the dating portions of dating apps, and receive near zero interaction there. And I mean VERY near zero. So I don't even get to the point of being anxious about the socializing there because it doesn't happen, but then that just causes different anxiety. 

I've tried volunteering, side jobs, and all sorts of other things, but I have a feeling that maybe I present as a severely uncomfortable human, and being 6'4"" thats probably hard to miss and if Im right, then that just makes me even less approachable. And I even preemptively try to make sure im not slumped over/slouching, not staring into a corner like a psychopath, and not frowning or having a look of fear in my eyes. Im doing everything to invite people in/toward me, and thats still anxiety inducing on its own, I don't know how to push any farther, let alone deal with the social anxiety of having the actual interactions when or IF they even come.

Im diagnosed ADHD as well as the generalized anxiety, CPTSD and suspected of being autistic, but I just have no idea how to compensate for that.

Ive been told a million times that I'm insightful, incredibly kind, emotionally intelligent, regular intelligent, sweet, funny, etc. And I know I have a lot to offer as a friend or even a partner! But the anxiety brings me to a place where It's hard not to feel like I've got some other issue(s) or that im just not the kind of person anybody wants to know.

I had hit the point at one moment where I was telling a couple acquainted coworkers like ""if Im medium ugly, or a 3 on a social scale as a whole please for the love of God just tell me that so I can move on to the acceptance stage because I can't do it.

It's been exactly 3 years since I've had a hug from a person. 2 years since I've been able to be emotionally vulnerable with someone and reciprocate. And almost a whole year since I've been able to go somewhere or play a game with a friend. Like one on one activities. 

I vaguely know what I should be doing to try and connect with people, I know that im anxious about those things as well as the long term results im trying to avoid. I just need input or something because im a verbal processor and since I can't really do that? I landed here, in defeat.

I apologize, ive edited this a bit trying to make it shorter but this is the best I can do right now.

It usually helps if I know the person online for longer and I develop some level comfort there before I meet them. And then I have a bit of time to prepare for the date itself. But most people just don't seem to want to wait that long.

I've usually said something like ""It's a little bit early for me, would you mind if we talked a little bit more here first?"" And usually people say that's alright, no big deal and then very soon thereafter most of them stop replying.

1mg2mo3,Social anxiety ruined my life,"
Hi, I'm 22 years old, and I can honestly say that social anxiety has ruined my life. I don’t know how to make friends, and because of that, I can’t go out or enjoy life like other people. There are so many things I don’t know about life, because friends usually help and support each other—and I’m an only child, with no siblings, no friends, and no close relatives.

All my college mates are looking for jobs or internship opportunities, while I’m stuck here, too afraid to deal with people or even go out and search for anything. I don’t even know how to search. They’re traveling to faraway countries to work, and I can’t even find a job close to where I live. When I see them doing all of that, it breaks me. I get deeply upset because I feel they’ll all become successful while I’ll be the failure among them.

They’re all improving themselves, and I don’t know how to do anything. I wish I could attend conferences, meet new people, and learn from those more experienced than me—but I can’t. And of course, all of them who have friends get so much support when they post anything on Facebook. Their friends guide them and help them, while I feel too embarrassed to even post anything on social media—no one knows me.

I feel like I’ll never be successful, never find a job, and never travel like them. There’s so much inside me I want to say, but I feel like my words are just a mess. I’m always tired and depressed because of this. I even tried therapy and medication, but nothing worked.

1mgqsji,Anxiety is ruining my career. I can't network with other people or establish new connections. I am also afraid of trying new things.,"I am doing a PhD and networking is key. But I can't network at all. I don't know what to say, I don't know how to start, I just stand there and freeze. Even when I force myself to attend a conference, I talk to nobody at all.

Or in general establishing new connections which could open up new career paths or job opportunities. I just can't and don't know how to do it. 

Kind of because of this, I am also afraid of trying out new things. Even if those things don't revolve around other people, I am still afraid that I will ruin myself even more (like let's say trading, which - if i mess up with paying taxes - can land me in jail). Or simpler things like going to a club where my friend is playing with his band.

Is there really no way to get rid of social anxiety, get rid of this anxiety around trying new things? You might think ""Exposure therapy"", but I tried that (like attending conferences), it doesn't work, it just confirms my (social) anxiety.

1mgv4um,What medication would suit me best after trying some,"Hello everyone! I have some severe social anxiety. Because I got bullied in the first years of high school I pretty much didn‘t go to any events or so. Birthday parties, school vacations. Even if someone invited me I wouldn’t join because the fear of getting bullied again or getting excluded at the certain event would be too risky. Because of that I pretty much never had a youth, I spent my time with online gaming in my room… So there I was: Finished with school with almost zero friends in the city I grew up and then joined university. Since I suck at small talk and overthink everything before I say it or afterwards I am never relaxed in my head so people don’t find me very fun too hang around with. I am studying at this university for about 3 years now in a very slow pace since my depression is like my biggest problem. Luckily I met like 3 people in that time which I occasionally see, but it’s way to rare since they constantly study and aren’t the party people. I can’t blame them for this but I lost my whole youth so I have the need to catch up very fast which isn’t working. I also have kind of a poker face and only can laugh naturally when I am like drunk which sucks. Anyway when I started university I visited a psychiatrist because I constantly got hot flashes and sweating when entering the university because of the social pressure. He prescribed me Zoloft in a low dose. I took it for some months, the sweating stopped. But I still didn’t feel very relaxed so I stopped taking it. I also got prescribed Lyrica (pregabaline)but that made me kind of dazed. Now (about 3 years later) I visited a psychiatrist again, sweating isn’t that much of an issue anymore, it is the consistent overthinking, not being relaxed, thinking I am weird to others, not being able to have the same joyful light headed existence as other people in their early twenties. Summer is the worst time for me since everybody is outside having fun etc and me being in my room, very depressed thinking how my life will go on and I can’t really change since the people I know aren’t interested in going on vacation or hanging around besides of university. So what I want: Stop overthinking everything, hopefully improving smalltalk through that, having motivation to leave the bed, don’t being depressed anymore, being able to naturally laugh like other people. The psychiatrist prescribed me Ritaline to stop the overthinking but it doesn’t feel natural to me and I am not happier with it. Now he wants to give me Wellbutrin. Do you think this is a good idea or should I rather go back to ssris? I also heard that Vortioxetine should be quite okay.

1mgc80b,I think I’m too boring.,"I’ve had social anxiety for as long as I can remember, but in the past few years it’s been worse than ever. 

I’m a 31 year old transmasc with no job and a chronic illness that keeps me mostly home bound. I have to continue to mask in public because getting sick sets back my recovery progress significantly, so I can’t really go to restaurants unless there’s outdoor seating. Crowded places are difficult, especially when there is little to no seating. I can’t reliably walk long distances, and I don’t sweat in reaction to heat so I can’t be outside for very long in the summer. I’m androgynous so even using the bathroom comes with a stressful set of decisions to make, and I tend to attract attention unintentionally.

I don’t watch much TV at all, I almost never play the same games other people I know are playing, and I’m not a movie guy. I read a lot of obscure manga and amateur comics. Most of my hobbies are on hold because I can’t physically do them.

Basically, I’m out of touch and have nothing to talk about anymore. On the rare occasion I get to see my friends IRL, the only thing I can say I’ve been up to is the same old health maintenance that has dominated my life for the past several years. They don’t think to invite me at this point because I had to refuse or cancel a few too many times.

I’ve always relied on the internet for socializing, but that doesn’t really work now. One community in particular that I’ve been involved in for nearly 10 years seems to be slowly freezing me out. People don’t really reply to things I have to say. I don’t really know how to find other communities I might fit into at this point that aren’t related to being chronically ill, and those spaces are almost always a huge bummer for understandable reasons.

Even without all of the material reasons that I’m isolated, I just don’t really know what I’m supposed to do. I think people could smell the desperation on me if I tried to make new friends. I can’t even have a normal conversation with store clerks or the people who we hire to help around the house. My husband is the only person I interact with regularly, which is a lot of pressure to put on him.

1mgijxs,Is my Friend's Avoiding me or doesn't know how to Interact with Humans Anymore ?,"Here's the deal, I have a friend that's socially anxious and a recluse, for a while I've been interacting with him most of the time, texting first, checking on him, talking about what I do, stuff we both like etc.. I offer to do stuff sometimes but it never gets anywhere, besides saying he'll see when he can do it and then I never hear from him about it again (he also doesn't have a job and lives with his parents, we live in the same town). Months ago, I told him that it would be good if he did check on me too sometimes, along his relatives and other people. He responded positively, saying he ""never considered it"" and ""feels only the need to text if something really important needs to be said"" (in 2 years he never texted me first for anything). And so he did, but it wasn't like the way I thought it would be, he just shoves me links to stuff he does, doesn't ask how I am, just mentions stuff I might have told him a while ago but never asks questions, just ends up says ""yeah good luck with that"". We don't talk much anymore, I just let him text me first those small check up every 2-3 weeks and since i'm not working to do all the conversation it just ends up stale. Yet he doesn't stop, so I don't know what to make of it. 

I'm wondering if he thinks that, this much talk is enough ""socializing"", if he doesn't really care and just text me when he's bored just to know he still has my attention, or just that he's completly clueless. He was always an reserved person, someone that doesn't speak his mind, needs someone to order him to do stuff, and says ""yes"" when what he means is ""no"".

 I don't live with my mom anymore, but the damage is done to my psyche. I get anxious real easily and I tend to worry about what people think about me. This is because mom would always complain about strangers talking about and making fun of her (they weren't) and now i get the feeling that people might be talking about me.

1mgc9u0,I hate outside and nobody gets it,"Where do I even start? I’m just a homebody. I like dressing up and buying clothes with the thought of actually going outside but do any social interaction is a hell no. I went to party for 6 minutes. I’ve bailed after showing up. Despite hating outside I do try to go and socialize but my social anxiety always has me stressed and in my head. I become an insecure mess, with too many thoughts and feeling almost ambushed in crowds of people. I’ve never experienced the trauma of a stampede or anything like that, yet these are the things that will come to mind. I know within myself that nobody is looking and no one cares and the odds of me getting harmed is slim yet I’m vigilant enough. 

It’s strange because I don’t mind going outside to spend time in nature, eg; park, beach, walk on a trail, real slow paced energy. I just can’t do the nightlife and crowds even in daytime events. 

My boyfriend is kinda of annoyed by it, and he says we never do anything he likes do. That’s a bit dramatic coming from him but I understand where he’s coming from. I’m just not a party girl, like people fucking scare me. ",1754202519.0,2,3,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mgc48k,My neighbor lost it on me and I've been obsessively panicking about it for 36 hours. How do I make this stop?,"So I got this dog for my daughter last fall. It's been a disaster. Supposed to be the best dog ever, turns out she wants to attack every other dog she sees. My neighbor hates her guts because she snarls at her dogs when we pass each other on walks, and once pinned her dog to the ground. I have a sometimes insane sense of commitment to making things work for my children (my parents really sucked), so I've gotten a trainer, a different trainer, a veterinary workup, a behaviorist, doggy Prozac, a series of gates, the list goes on.
 
  Contractors keep leaving my doors and gates open even when they leave for the day. I have three kids and a mountain of shit to do, so I'm not always aware that this has happened, and unfortunately there have been a couple instances where I've let the dogs out of their ""contractors are here"" room and they've just bolted. Even more instances where the contractors just clambered through the house opening every goddamn door themselves. Yes, I've complained (this has happened with at least three different companies). 

 Day before yesterday, a gutter guy did an estimate and left. I let the dogs out back, gave my kid his heart medicine, and went to check on the dogs. Gate open (fuck). Ran outside and got them, they were with a really nice and understanding neighbor a few houses down. Five minutes tops they were out there. Now, I don't really know if they went to the house across the street and harassed the dogs there through the fence or what (I didn't hear them at all, and they're very vocal), but across the street neighbor lady comes *flying* out of her house screaming at the top of her lungs, I mean veins popping, spitting, making herself hoarse screaming. She tells me to give them to someone who cares, she refuses to accept that I did not let them out and got on top of it immediately, she screams at me to MOVE AWAY!!! I haven't seen someone that unhinged since my mom before her work-mandated anger management in 2009 (so obviously that was triggering AF). 

 Fact of the matter is, I am rehoming the problem dog. The fear surrounding this has taken over my life. I can't even justify the fact that she chases cats (because I have a cat!!). None of the professionals I've consulted with have had a real solution, just various methods of preventing her from ever seeing a dog. I just did so many things and tried so hard. I feel so bad for my kid, but honestly they aren't even very close anyway (the kids find the dog ""annoying but cute"" at best).
 
 What I'm *really* struggling with here is an insane level of obsession over this incident. I can't sleep, I'm scared to go outside and run into her, I can't think of anything else, all I do is panic that that lady lives right across the street and hates my guts. I admit I've allowed a problem to carry on too long due to my own stubbornness regarding my children, but the way she treated me just plummeted me back to my abusive childhood, and it's pathetic (I'm 35!!!). The entire world has shrunk to only the size of this one incident. 

 How the hell do I pull up from this nosedive? Knowing myself, I'll feel better in time, but I will *never* let it go, or feel as comfortable on my own street as I used to, and I don't want that. Help =(",1754201911.0,2,9,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mg15zp,I seriously need to manage my social anxiety,"Hey, I’m 27 and work from home at a tech company. I get along really well with my manager and have no issues in formal or professional settings. That’s not really the problem though.
I’ve noticed I struggle more in informal social situations, especially around people my age. I used to be quite overweight and lost about 15 kgs, which honestly helped a lot with my confidence. Back in uni, I was bullied a lot and that kind of stopped me from forming real friendships during those years.
Even though I’ve worked on myself a lot since then, I still get really anxious in social settings. It honestly depends on the vibe, if the people seem warm or open, I can loosen up and be myself. But when it’s a big group, I suddenly feel super boring. I know I’m not, and I actually have a lot to say, but I get so guarded that I end up avoiding eye contact and keeping my thoughts to myself.
What’s weird is that I don’t always feel like this. But if there are even just a couple of people from my uni in the group, the anxiety kicks in hard. I just shrink back into that old version of me and it’s so frustrating. What should i do? How can I help myself? Should i take medication to manage my anxiety?

1mfnxwk,Does your SA get better when the people around you are drunk?,"Hey everybody, I have a rather random question.

Personally I don't drink alcohol. But I noticed something: Whenever the people around me are drunk, I'm kinda able to ""mimic"" their state. I become louder, more chill, my mind is much more at ease and my Social Anxiety just calms down. It's still there, but not as loud anymore. I noticed this many times already, literally yesterday I was very uncomfortable at a birthday of a family member, but the second everyone got drunk I was able to make my Social Anxiety shut up.    
I think this happens because my brain thinks ""they're drunk, they won't judge me anymore, they rather laugh or even forget a lot of stuff"", hence my Social Anxiety gets better because people aren't that much aware anymore.

and like im starting to judge my own self in private too. like i keep judging my own actions and thoughts and things i say and do like “is that an okay thing to do/say?” or “would so and so do this?” (i also have ocd so this specific thing could be related to that lol )

and idk overthinking so much has me genuinely acting awkward and weird around ppl. like i hate getting a job bc i get so overwhelmed in the beginning that i act so odd and that’s ppls first impression of me. it’s so bad and idek how im gonna get a husband, start a family, support myself feeling like this. like everything i do is weird, wrong, and everyone is judging me.

i just can’t do life like this anymore and im really struggling bc i want to do normal life stuff like get a job, a manz, kids all of it. but i just don’t think i see that happening if i continue on like this.

but i can’t stop caring. because ive tried to see the bigger picture. i’ve tried to tell myself its not that deep, no one cares about you at the end of the day. but i can’t change the way my mind works, or at least i can’t by myself.

i definitely need to get back in anxiety medicine and maybe go back to therapy but i don’t have insurance so until i get a job idk if i can.

1mfaqku,How (I think) we can beat social anxiety,"So there is this thing called 'following your natural impulses to speak up'.

You might recall how in some social situation you wanted to say something but you couldn't because of your anxiety and then later on you felt sad and guilty about it. It is this feeling of sadness that makes us believe that we just had a 'failed' social interaction.

On the other hand, if you do speak up in such situations, you may have noticed that while you do feel discomfort, you never feel sad or guilty.

Basically, in the first case, we are not able to do something (speak up) that we really want to. As a result, we feel sad.

Now this principle can be extended to performing tasks like buying groceries. In the moment you truly want go out there and buy groceries but you cannot because of your anxiety. And the fact that you cannot do something which you really want to do makes you sad. If you were to complete this task despite the anxiety, you wouldn't feel sad. You would feel uncomfortable but not sad. And doing this multiple times would eventually reduce the discomfort as well.

I think this, that is, following your natural impulses to speak up (or doing what you truly feel like doing in the moment), is the way to beat social anxiety. Of course, you have to start small and then keep building on it.",1754088603.0,71,13,socialanxiety,anxiety

Growing up, I was accused of things I didn’t do. I tried to defend myself, but no one believed me, not even my parents. I felt helpless, like I had no one on my side. That happened a lot, and it left me always expecting to be blamed or misunderstood.

Now, when I talk to people, I feel this fear that they’ll judge me or assume something about me, and I won’t be able to defend myself. Like I’ll break down and be rejected or humiliated again. It doesn’t help that I grew up in a very judgmental family, always criticising others, even strangers. That shaped how I see myself.

I’m starting to realise at least in my situation, that anxiety is less about the present and more about old survival patterns stuck in the body. Does anyone else relate to this?

**TL;DR:** Had an insight in therapy last week. I was talking to my therapist about the anxiety I feel around people, and he casually suggested I might have some kind of psychic sensitivity. I was like… uh, I don’t think so.

But it stuck with me, and I started thinking about why he’d say that. Then I realised something, I’d been telling him that I felt anxious, but I never really explained why. When I sat with it, it finally clicked: I’m afraid of being judged.

Not in a casual way, but in a deep, survival-based way. I’ve got C-PTSD from childhood, and an anxious-avoidant personality. I grew up being accused of things I didn’t do, judged harshly, and left feeling alone and unsafe. So now, that fear shows up as anxiety whenever I’m around people.

So yeah, not psychic, just someone who’s been wired to see the world as a threat. And it finally makes sense.",1754140284.0,3,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mfieu9,Weirdest Panic? Or Biological?,"Is it just me? Or has anyone else experienced something like this?

Last night, I was still awake around 4 AM. I felt completely fine—no worry, no anxiety. But as soon as I decided to sleep, I suddenly noticed my heart pounding really hard. It was so intense that I could feel my pulse in my throat and even in my back. It started gradually, then kept getting faster and faster. I think my heart rate hit around 120 bpm. It lasted for about 20 minutes and then went away.

I have health anxiety and GAD, and I’ve been dealing with panic and anxiety attacks, which I’ve learned to manage over time. But what happened last night felt so different. There was no fear. No adrenaline rush. No sense of doom. No shortness of breath or the usual symptoms I get during anxiety episodes. It was just my heart pounding rapidly—and now I'm anxious just thinking about what that was.

I even started wondering if it was triggered by the bread or chips I ate an hour before going to bed.

Also, over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been getting this strange “impending doom” feeling—it’s like a heavy sense of fear stuck in the center of my chest or stomach. But it doesn’t come with any physical symptoms. My heart rate stays normal, no pounding, no other signs.

My sister, who’s a nurse, told me it’s almost impossible for me to suddenly develop a heart problem in just two years—especially since in 2023 I had countless ER visits at different hospitals. I had several ECGs, 2D ECHOs, and EKGs done.

She also reminded me that heart problems usually show up during physical activity, which I haven’t experienced.

this all of course becomes so much worse when im talking to COMPLETE strangers, at this point its not me trying my best to act normal, i get extremely anxious and my heart races at the speed of light and i cant think enough to act normal. in normal's stead, i just appear completely emotionless. i dont express the anxiety in stuttering or any other way apart from fumbling sentences, i just unintentionally have no emotions at all and dont realize it. and i just do not know what to say. i could go on for a WHILE about all the things i did in public which i at the moment thought were perfectly normal but later VERY CLEARLY proved to not be so, but quite honestly they are both far too embarassing and far too great in volume.

I also have a minor speech impediment, so the anxiety kind of made sense. Every time I opened my mouth, I was met with mockery. It made me want to shut down. I tried medication five separate times, but nothing really helped—except narcotics and liquor, which obviously came with their own problems.

Just after my 31st birthday, I was finally diagnosed with ADHD. I tried Ritalin. Nothing. Then Concerta. Still nothing. But recently I started Vyvanse—and it’s honestly been like a miracle.

That constant panic I used to feel in conversations? Gone. My mind is finally quiet enough to think clearly. Before, I couldn’t really pay attention when people spoke. My brain would race in a hundred directions, trying to craft a reply instead of actually *listening* to the other person. I always thought that was me being self-absorbed, but now I realize it was the ADHD.

Now I don’t feel that crushing pressure to respond instantly. I can take a moment, think, and actually *engage* in the conversation.

For most of my life, I thought social anxiety was the root problem. Turns out, it was just a symptom of undiagnosed ADHD.

I’m not saying I’m “cured.” I still have years of loneliness and isolation to work through. But my mind feels like a completely different place to live in now.

1mexl06,A question about the 'social battery' and the guilt of being a 'bad friend'...,"Hey everyone,

I've been wrestling with something lately and was wondering if it resonates with anyone here. I think of my social energy like a 'social battery,' and lately, it feels like it's been draining faster than ever.   



The hardest part is the anxiety and guilt. I have a small circle of friends I truly cherish, but after a long week, I often have zero energy left to reply to texts or make plans. Then the 'reciprocity guilt' kicks in—that voice that tells you you're a 'bad friend' for not keeping in touch, especially when they're the ones always reaching out. It can lead to a real 'introvert hangover,' where you're not just tired, but also anxious about letting people down.   



It feels like a vicious cycle: you need solitude to recharge, but the withdrawal makes you feel guilty, which makes future interactions even more draining.

She says ""say hello to this person"", ""move to that place"", ""help this person"", ""do this"". I don't know what to do because, if I ignore her, everyone will look at me and think I'm mean. She also looks at me and tells me stuff like ""you have hair in your upper lip"", or ""your eyebrow looks bad, I will give it form when we come home"".

You don't know about streets. Your work was in (she mentioned a wrong street)"" I corrected her andd she insisted. Then, I told her my job was downtonwn. She responded, as if I was saying somthing dumb: ""we're not downtown. You don't know ANYHTING"". I told her I do, since I ride my bike and learned to move in town by my own. But she just said. ""No, you're wrong. I will teach you about streets and how to read Google Maps."" I told her I didn't want to. I already know Google maps (I stuttered and even had a weird tone, that's something I do when I get nervous or annoyed, but I've realised some people thing I'm being to reactive when I do that), and she just told me ""Whatever"" with a tone of surpirse from my reaction, like she was trying to tell me not to be dramatic.

I don't know if she actually do this because she's naive or because she's just mean. Then, after saying and doing those things, she buys me things, takes my hand or plays with my hand, like normal sisters. She only does that when we're around people. The other day, we went for dinner with some family and othe people and she acted very nice with everyone while she was calling me with nicknames (that I asked before not to call me like that), and the other people liked her so much. They were talking to her, and even remembered her name. I felt so weird I wanted to cry. I even caught a girl looking only at me, with a grimace. But I realised about other thing: the other day, she was behaving with everybody in my family and telling me what to do, but once we were for lunch with my father, she became silent and didn't tell me what to do. My father seemed okay with what I did and what I didn't do, not like the others. On the other hand, whene I'm with my mother and my sister, they tell me not to be dramatic and that they're just joking. I don't know if I'm being paranoic.

I also don't know why she acts like that. Chatgpt told me she's just insecure, but I don't know what she would be so insecure about. She grew up with me knowing all the tings I was so insecure about. Everybody loves her no matter where we go, and she's always been prettier. Why would she want to feel more socially secure when people already love her?",1754078190.0,1,1,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mem4mc,Social anxiety is more complex than it seems,"Have you noticed that psychiatrists reduce social anxiety to merely performance anxiety, while it's actually much more complex than that?
I feel that this oversimplification and treating the disorder as if it's something easy that can be cured just by exposure is the reason why patients often never truly recover.
In my opinion, exposure therapy without addressing the root causes of the problem such as the identity crisis and the shame experienced by the person with social anxiety  only worsens the disorder.

1mdtpq8,my anxiety makes me stupid.,"I don’t know how to explain really. I have had brain fog consistently for most of my life now. It’s even more aggravated in social settings. 

Mentally, I’m always feeling sluggish, like my mind is struggling to catch up with what’s happening in front of me. I can’t understand what people are saying to me immediately, and sometimes whats being said never clicks to me until it is way too late after the interaction. And sometimes it never comes to me at all. I think this is also made worse by the fact that I have had gradual hearing loss over the years. 

When I’m put on the spot, I can only freeze up and stare into space. I just blank out. My word recall is genuinely horrible, I have no idea how to respond or what to say. I think most people assume I’m stupid or mentally impaired with the way I act. 

 I always make mistakes when I’m tasked with something, it’s not that I’m intentionally trying to be careless but it’s difficult to snap out of the mental fog and focus on the moment — if anyone understands what I’m saying?

Is this considered a mental impairment even? Does anyone else relate to this? I’m not sure how to improve or what to even do about it, or if I’m stuck dealing with this for as long as I live. I’ve been trying to get out of my comfort zone lately, but I always feel like I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown.  I don’t know how to behave or act in most situations.

1meoeg2,Avoidant personality + noise sensitivity + roommates: how do you deal with this?,"I’m about to move to a new country for grad school, and while I’m excited, I’ve also been drowning in anxiety.

I think I have some avoidant personality traits — I tend to freeze up or shut down in uncomfortable situations, especially when it comes to conflict or setting boundaries.



One of my biggest fears right now is shared housing. I can’t afford a studio, so I’ll be living with strangers. Even thinking about everyday situations — like a clogged shower drain or someone leaving the toilet messy — gives me this deep sense of dread. I know these things sound small, but they stress me out to the point where I question if I can even function like a normal adult.



I’m also super sensitive to noise, especially certain types. Where I’m from, it’s common for people to watch short videos with these sped-up, sharp, AI-generated voiceovers — I find those sounds unbearable. Once, when I was traveling with someone close to me, I tried to bring this up, but the conversation didn’t go well. I ended up staying quiet, even though it really affected me. I felt like I wasn’t being heard, and that experience stuck with me for a long time.



Now I’m afraid that I’ll go through something similar with future roommates — that I won’t be able to express my discomfort, and I’ll just bottle it up and spiral internally like I always do.



If anyone here has experience with this kind of sensitivity — or being conflict-avoidant and still wanting to maintain your emotional boundaries — I’d love to hear how you cope. I feel like I’m still learning how to live with people without losing myself.",1754027122.0,3,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

I fucking hate going to school but not because i dont like school, but because i always see people hanging out, and i treat myself like i am unable to be included. I am always alone, and i see everyone walking with someone else and talking to someone else, there are very little people that walk alone, and this frustrates me. I have an history of being hated and excluded, and so, even if i want to have the same connections that i see people having, being included in basically anything makes me uncomfortable, very uncomfortable for some reason, and i always go in tilt when people do. Dk if its something all schools do, but in my school during school break you can wander the school freely and go in the schoolyard, but you can theoretically stay in the classroom if you want. Everytime during school break i remain in class watching people socialize through the window. Teachers have tried in every way to make me go out of the classroom because everyone in my class does all the times, but they technically cant force me. The extroverts are extroverts and the introverts always have some friend in the school (i just have one friend that visits me once a month and one i only talk with on the phone), but everytime i go out seeing everyone just socialize makes me so irritated and sad, it almost psychologically hurts i dont know how to describe it. My class is not bad tho, and they actually try to include me, but everytime i get uncomfortable and i get so scared i will be treated like im annoying or weird, so i go in tilt and i start talking weirdly, eating my own words, asking stuff i already know just to buy time to think about what i should tell them, but i do that over idiotic stuff, stuff like ""are you coming with us at Mcdonalds today after school?"". The thing that weirds me out is that when i was a child i used to be the most sociable thing in the world. I used to befriend rocks, i had incredible social skills, but then during the middle school i became hated because i was dirty and annoying, but i didn't know that, i thought people liked me, so when i found out they didn't my world fell completely apart, and i started being like this. This makes me angry because i know that now im different and im not annoying and stuff, but im still so hell-bent on this exclusion shit that i am scared of doing anything fearing i will be treated like weird or dirty or annoying again and be excluded again.

1me100l,Overcoming social anxiety seems impossible for me,"I had social anxiety I believe my entire life, but ever since high school, it's been hell for me. Especially in college. I struggled making friends because of my social anxiety and perhaps how my brain works. 

My focus is completely fucked. I have hard time focusing on anything. Whether I'm in class, talking to someone, watching a tv show, reading (I have dyslexia), etc... I have memory issues. For example when someone tells me an important information, I always forget one thing from it, or I go outside to the store and at the cash register I reliaze I forgot my wallet. My brain is also interpeting things wrong. Sometimes when someone asks me a simple question, I'd either mishear what they've said, respond without thinking or interpret it wrong. I am almost always 24/7 distracted ans anxious. I'm am also a perfectionist. I was like that since I was born. 

How can I believe in myself despite having all these issues inside my head? How can I be confident if I'll always fuck up badly and be perceived as someone who is stupid? I know everyone makes mistakes and it's stupid to punish myself for that, but I can't let go of it. It's like my mistakes are far worse than others. I feel like everyone is above me and I'm a dumbass. Even with hobbies and soon having a degree literally doesn't change me.

1mecol4,My friends think I have social anxiety. I’m not so sure.,"For almost as long as I can remember I’ve been a little afraid and unsure of myself. These days I constantly fear not necessarily that I’m hated, but that there’s nothing really special about my presence and I’m being replaced. Well, occasionally, I do fear that everyone hates me, but my brain always rationalizes that into “nobody hates you, people would have to care to hate you.” 

Most people who spend enough time dealing with me end up saying I have social anxiety and I don’t totally believe them? I’m always afraid, it’s not just social situations. Maybe im misinterpreting but I’m not even an introvert, in fact I’m so desperate for attention that often I exaggerate issues in the hopes of being seen and centered. I desperately cannot handle being lonely. Being lonely destroys everything good about me. 

I wonder sometimes if I’m delusional. Is there such a thing? A delusion that makes you feel victimized and simultaneously like you’ve done something to deserve this false victimization? I can really easily sense the hatred in people’s words, and it really hurts, but the world keeps moving as if my emotions mean nothing. My face doesn’t really show anything… I can be on the verge of screaming or crying and nobody even notices. If they do ask if I’m okay I almost automatically say I am. I don’t know what to do.

I just, I don’t fear hatred so much, I fear that somehow I’m completely missing something that makes me worth interacting with. My friends all make plans with each other and I wish I had some shared interest or passion with them, but I know I’ll be quiet and weird if I get invited anyway.

1mebu7x,I was living with social anxiety… then something shifted,"For as long as I can remember, talking to people has always felt like a huge effort.
Not because I didn’t like them, but because I never really knew what to say or how to act.
Even something as simple as a greeting or a small question would make me overthink a hundred times before responding. I was always afraid of sounding dumb, boring, or just… off.

I used to avoid parties, gatherings, even family events. I preferred staying in my room, listening to music or watching videos—just to forget myself a bit.
But silence didn’t mean peace, it meant loneliness.
I laughed with people in memes, but in real life, I had no one to laugh with.

At some point, the days all started to look the same. I wasn’t even sure who I was anymore—just a person constantly trying to avoid everything that involved people.

But recently, small changes started happening.
Not the dramatic movie-type changes, just simple stuff—like being able to stay in a public place without panicking, or answering a phone call without rehearsing my words, or even waking up in the morning and not feeling as heavy as before.

I wouldn’t say I’m healed, or that my life is perfect now, but there’s a difference.
Something definitely shifted, and honestly… I kinda like it.

Maybe the thing that made the difference wasn’t even that big.
Just something I decided to do every day, without expecting magic results from the first week…
And maybe that simple routine is what slowly brought me back to myself.

I once loved and cared deeply for all these people, and I have this huge anxiety that I'll run into them in public. It's been festering my mind ever since dropping those old friends, and my ex breaking up with me. I catch myself multiple times a day thinking of how any of my digital actions (Social media, spotify playlists, letterboxd reviews lmao, etc.) would be seen through the eyes of those people.

I catch myself driving past her job and glancing into the window, or parking lot to see if her car is there (Her workplace is on the way to my job and I can't help but glance, not deliberately going anywhere).

Would she watch and enjoy this movie? Would she like this music? What would she think? Would she approve?"". I feel like I can't control this side of me, and it's driving me fucking nuts. I try doing things I once loved, and the spark isn't there somehow. On top of this, when meeting new people, or talking to coworkers, I just feel an inch of anxiety no matter what. Nothing over the top, but I noticeably overthink what to say or what to do with my body when speaking to others. I also tend to compare partners I've had since to her, and I feel guilty for that. I want to stop worrying and obsessing over how my ex, old friends, and new people might view me, I just want to be myself. I feel like until I can stop doing this, I won't be able to be the best version of myself.

After my breakup, I developed this constant fear of running into my ex or old friends I cut off during the relationship — something I now regret. I find myself obsessing over how they might perceive everything I do, from social media to how I dress or what I listen to. I still unconsciously live through her gaze, wondering if she’d approve. I’ve lost a sense of who I am, stopped expressing myself like I used to, and even feel anxious around new people. I keep comparing others to her, and it’s driving me crazy. I just want to stop overthinking and finally feel like *myself* again.",1753990721.0,1,0,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mdup1c,"I’m way better at texting than real-life conversation, and I don’t know why.","I’ve noticed that I’m really good at holding conversations over text. I can easily explain things, go into detail, use good vocabulary, and even come up with random topics to keep things going. But when I talk in person, even with people I’m comfortable with, I struggle to describe things as well as others do and can’t come up with good topics the way I do naturally over text. It feels like I can’t think of interesting and niche topics the same way I can over text or contribute to a conversation as much. My vocabulary drops, and I have a hard time going in depth, even though I clearly understand what’s being said and know I could respond better if it were over text. I don’t think before texting at all, I just blurt out what comes first, usually within seconds, so it’s weird I’m unable to do the same in real life when it feels like a very similar headspace and reaction. I don’t really feel anxious, and I can greet people and do small talk fine, but it feels like I can’t contribute to conversations as much in person. Even though I’m in the same headspace during both and don’t overthink or try hard to come up with things, the ideas just naturally flow smoother when I’m texting.

I was homeschooled after 7th grade and haven’t had many in-person social situations since then. I mostly stay in touch with people online and over the phone. I used to deal with pretty bad anxiety until it went away. Now, this is the only thing that still makes me feel a little off. 

I want to be able to talk the same way I text, naturally, clearly, and in detail. I’m not sure if this is a social skill issue or something else.

What are some specific steps I can take to get better at expressing myself clearly while speaking and carrying deeper conversations in real life?",1753945192.0,8,3,socialanxiety,anxiety

I am an 18 year old student, who has been planning on moving abroad to study Law. I've been gearing towards this for months, and have accomodation secured (deposits paid), with all arrangements set to move come the end of August.

But in the past few weeks, I've had severe anxiety with throwing up after I eat food, countless nights without proper sleep, and have not being able to enjoy the summer as the thought of moving has consumed me. I've always been an anxious person the entire of my life, but I feel I'm at unprecedented levels.

I do really want to study Law in that particular university but I think I also am seeing a lot about high dropout rate, hard to pass, etc.

It's a big personal and financial commitment, and I'm really afraid of wasting time, money, and letting myself and people around me down.

1mdcixu,Had an embarrassing experience at therapy and now idk how to go back,"I have been going to therapy for maybe three months for issues related to social anxiety. My worries about what others think of me have caused me to be very socially isolated and be extremely embarrassed over everything.  

I had never done any sort of mental health treatment before this so therapy is all very new and in many ways stressful and embarrassing for me.  My therapist is really nice and has been helpful so far.  A few days ago I had a session.  I don’t really do much in general and that week I only did school.  I was kinda thinking about things but I was too embarrassed to bring them up.  I had hoped I  would think of something but I didn’t.  

I got there and said I couldn’t think of anything.  I got embarrassed from not knowing what to say and asked if I could cancel sessions if I had nothing to say.  He said yes and said I could cancel this one.  I was thinking about it because it was hard for me to decide bc I’ve never been in this sort of situation and he said I had to decide soon.  I’m not blaming him I completely understand.  I panicked and said to end it and stepped out to leave.  I ended up rushing through the receptionist and my therapist and cutting them off and leaving.  I just panicked.  

I feel so embarrassed and I don’t know why I did that.  I know I flee when I feel embarrassed but idk why I got so panicky.  I dont know why I do things like this.  I feel so embarrassed and just keep replaying it in my head.  I am now feeling the urge to quit my entire therapy and cancel any other sessions.  I can’t imagine being able to see him again.  I’m very upset about it and spent the rest of the day doing things to forget that I did that.  

I’m pretty functional.  I have had consistent jobs and go to school I’m just not happy bc I have no social life and my social anxiety is preventing me from doing things that might make me happier.  So I don’t really need this.  I just thought it would help with the other issues and it has kinda but I might be able to work those out by myself, if not slowly.  

I could get a new therapist but he was the best option where I live for my more specific issues.  I don’t know what to do.  I feel so much shame and self hatred for walking out.  Any advice?

1mdttex,HELP! Sinking and Blackhole sensation that lasts for 5-10mins.," Please help! Has anyone else experienced this same sensation in their chest?

I’ve been suffering from health anxiety since 2019 and was diagnosed with GAD in 2023. And undiagnosed Social anxiety! I first experienced this weird sinking sensation in the center of my chest in 2023. It feels like a black hole is draining all my energy, or like someone is pulling my chest inward — followed by extreme fatigue and weakness. It feels like I just ran a marathon and I'm completely exhausted.

What’s strange is that it always happens when I’m at rest.

In the same year, I started taking Jovia for one year, and all my symptoms disappeared. I stopped the medication in November 2024.

But now, in my new job, I’ve started experiencing panic and anxiety again. It's not as bad as it was two years ago — back then I ended up in the ER countless times. Now I know it's anxiety, and I remind myself that it will pass.

But this sensation always brings that second voice in my head: ""What if this isn’t anxiety this time? What if this time, something really happens and I actually die?""

Again, this sensation always occurs at rest. I jog daily for 20 to 30 minutes and feel totally fine while exercising — no chest pain, no dizziness, nothing that suggests a heart issue.

But when that sinking feeling comes, it makes me think something’s wrong with my heart. It doesn't come with palpitations like during panic attacks, and my heart rate usually stays around 90 to 100 bpm when it happens.",1753941906.0,1,1,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mdd1as,"3 years in the making, and being uncomfortable, repeated exposure worked for me.","Long story short, (don't ask why but it wasn't to overcome my SA) I became a group fitness instructor. I went through college not wanting to speak up in classes. Through countless of group fitness classes always in the second row and back. Many years of being timid and wanting to disappear into the wall. Only saving grace I had was I’m extroverted. So I do indeed yearn to connect with people but my SA wouldn’t allow me often to. 

I've been consistently instructing in a class for 3 years straight (varies between 2-5x a week). Being front and center. Microphone on and those people behind me have to listen to my voice, my corney jokes, my cues, my whoo hoos and then decide to come back or not. Yes, it's 100% of being vulnerable and judged. And constantly being exposed to rejection when they don’t return and my mind always telling me it was definitely because they didn’t like me. 

But it's a place of familiarity now. And no the floor didn't break open and swallow me whole each and every time I had to put myself through this.

I realized I broke through the other day when I was a participant in another instructor's class. Damn straight I just spoke out loud, making comments here and there. I'm comfortable now. I was surprised I got here, how comfortable it was for me to speak up in a group. And it wasn’t even my class. My mind just switched to… you’ve done this before. Nothing is going to happen to you. 

Grateful I stuck it out and been okay with feeling hella uncomfortable because now that fear is gone (well it's significantly subsided and comes in small twinges sometimes). But there’s a lot of comfort in familiarity, and it’s allowed me to conquer a lot of my SA fears.

1mclv1g,"I'd much prefer NOT having panic attacks every day all day, thank you very much","My mother is a whore and couldn't keep her legs closed, so I spent my entire childhood moving in with each of her partners after the next. We NEVER stayed in 1 place for more than 3 years; by or before the 3-year mark, she met someone new, and we'd all move in with them, then it would turn out they were abusive, so now we are homeless, so we move into a cheap apartment, and while she went out on dates with them, she forced me to stay home and babysit her children. She said since I'm the eldest child, I'm their “slave” and have to do EVERYTHING she says without question, and I'm the “secondary parent” to her children. ***THOSE WERE HER WORDS DIRECTLY***; I ***WISH*** I was making this up. I wasn't allowed to leave the house unless it was for school or I was with her. She NEVER let me have friends either because she ""had a bad feeling about them"", or she just didn't want me texting or calling them because that would distract me from doing her laundry and cleaning and babysitting her children. 

This time the apartment was getting way too expensive despite being a low-income apartment complex. So we had to move in with her parents. She promised them it would ONLY be 6 months or a year that we would be living with them, and she'd be looking for a new apartment the whole time and saving her money. Well, she lied, and she spent money like she's a millionaire, and she forced her parents into turning their basement into an apartment, and I guess she lives here permanently now. 

Because my mother forced her father to turn the basement into an apartment, her parents went into debt, and now they are arguing about paying it off and are now forcing me to pay some of it off too for some reason. 

They said there's a deal I made (which I very much didn't, or at least have no memory of making) where I had to get a job by 2 Aprils ago, and I did; I got a winter job last winter, and because of the severe social anxiety I developed because my mother shut me in 24/7, I was having severe panic attacks my entire 10-hour shift, and that caused my DPDR to get worse to the point I was dissipating for 5 hours per day for 6 weeks, and now it's developed into me having a dissociation episode 1+ times a day to the point even my empathy-less mother asks if I'm okay because I look like I'm ""not all there"". My last job was so bad; I worked 10 hours and got 1 10-minute break. I also had no training and was making shit up on the spot, and my manager was a drill sergeant that LOVED to prank people and make them do silly chores that don't exist for our job just to make us look stupid in front of everyone so he could laugh at us and get everyone else to laugh at us. The ONLY thing keeping me from offing myself was the hope that my job was going to end by the end of winter. 

Now my grandparents are getting pissed that I don't have a job as of current, and my mom's mother said that I have to pay a portion of my mother's debt since I live here too. I keep telling my mom's parents about my mental illnesses (severe and crippling social anxiety and DPDR), and they say that I'm making it up and using it as an excuse to be lazy and NOT get a job (they don’t believe mental illness is a real thing, like, genuinely they don’t think it’s real). 

They are also mad that I don't have a driver's license, and they won't listen to me when I tell them I don't want to drive because I have a severe phobia of driving because when I was super excited about driving and just learning how to drive, my mother yelled at me because I almost slowly backed into someone's house, and instead of telling me what to do to stop the car, she yelled at me like I already knew what to do even though that was my FIRST time driving so I had NO IDEA what I was doing, and that gave me a severe phobia of driving because now my body associates driving (whether I'm driving or someone else) with fear, panic, and potential death. 

I'm the LEAST problematic person in that house! I sit in my room and don't bother anyone, and ONLY talk to them when they talk to me, and do what they tell me to when they tell me! How am I being problematic to the point they want to kick me out? I GENUINELY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M DOING WRONG!!! I DON'T CAUSE PROBLEMS! 

I guess I'm sort of waiting for my $10,000 in the bank to dry up because my mother keeps using my money because she has none so I have a reason to off myself. No money in the bank would make the list longer of things I fucked up in: I'm obese, I'm hideous, my dreams of being an author have failed, I'm 19 and still live with my mommy, AND am broke! That's a lot of good reasons to NOT be alive! 

I don't even know how much the debt is; all my mother’s mother said was that I'm going to pay off a bit of it because I live with my mommy, who lives with her mommy (grandparents house, basement is mother’s house). 

I don't know what to do because I want to spend my time creative writing and making an actual living doing something I LOVE and NOT having severe panic attacks all day every day and having DPDR episodes every day all day just to barely ANY money that's NOT enough to live off of. 

I have no other option. I'm 19; my childhood is fucking DEAD at this point. I need to give up on this STUPID DREAM that I can be an author and just kill myself. I have no other reason to live, and I refuse to get a job because I don't want to trigger my severe social anxiety for NO fucking money. 

There really is NOTHING for me. I can't drive because of my driving PTSD, so the job needs to be very close to where I live, and the ONLY close jobs to where I live are fast food and retail. That's a VERY SOCIAL and high-stress job, and I also can't do math or count coins, and the USA has tax, so coins are needed, but I barely know how to count using coins, and I doubt they'll let me have a calculator or notepad nearby so I can do long addition to count up all the money. 

So I'm fucked because of social anxiety, my driving PTSD, and because I'm a fucking idiot that can't do math. 

There really is NOTHING I can do. I'm just fucked, and there's no way out of this. ",1753819300.0,18,9,socialanxiety,anxiety

1mcsm5p,Going through a breakup with social anxiety,"I (21f) have been in a relationship for two and a half years. My partner has been very supportive of my social anxiety journey. He has adhd so he has empathy for how i struggle with my anxiety. He was so helpful and was there for me when i started going to a psychiatrist, getting medicated, getting therapy, and was just great. He never judged me for how i would freak out over almost every interaction i had outside of him.

Well, he wants to move on without me and it’s not easy for me. He did cheat on me (kinda) so i’m also feeling pretty betrayed. I now realized that maybe he has enabled my behavior of isolation? Without fully intending it obviously. I kinda feel like i messed up by relying on him for all support outside of my therapist… 

I’m really nervous to go back out on the dating scene. It’s so stressful to start anew especially when someone was super supportive. I’m also losing so many family and friends that he showed me and i feel like i need to really get more support. I’m not looking forward to dating and maybe having to give education to those who dont understand social anxiety. I also worry that future partners will be dismissive. I was wondering if anyone had advice on dating with social anxiety and getting over a breakup?",1753836174.0,4,1,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mcm5nl,Zoloft Story,"My Zoloft/Sertraline Success Story

I want to start by saying that I know how many of you are feeling when starting Zoloft (sertraline). I am a 24-year-old female, and when I started, I was so scared. My doctor didn’t give me much information before I dove in, and I felt like I was walking into the unknown.

The first three days felt fine and then it hit me. For about six days, I was nauseous, sad, and didn’t want to eat or leave my room. I felt discouraged, let down, and I wanted to give up. Like many people, I turned to Reddit, and reading horror stories only made me feel worse.

One thing changed everything. I talked to my godmother, who struggles with anxiety and depression like I do. She told me, “Don’t give up.” As hard as it was, I listened to her. By the time I hit the two-week mark, I felt 100 times better. I still had my moments, but overall, things were improving.

Six months in, my life looked completely different. I could socialize without panicking, I wasn’t exhausted all the time, and I finally felt like myself again. My biggest fears like planes, social events, long car rides, work, and school started to feel manageable.

Now, at one year on Zoloft (100mg), I can honestly say I’m a different person. I fly to visit my brother in another state at least once a month. I adopted a cat. I moved out with my boyfriend. I go to concerts, grocery stores, and even travel solo. I started a new job.

Zoloft also changed my relationship with my boyfriend. We have been together for seven years, and even though he is incredibly understanding, my anxiety put a strain on us. Now, I can enjoy life with him without constant panic attacks ruining our plans.

I just want everyone to know that it absolutely gets better. Everyone’s experience is different, but my biggest advice is to start slow. If possible, begin with half the prescribed dose and increase it every five days. It makes the transition so much easier on your body and mind.

A year ago, I never would have had the confidence to write something like this, but here I am. I lost so many years of my life to anxiety and fear, but I am finally living again, and I am so grateful I stuck with it

1mcsamp,I am lonely,"Today, I tried my best not to cry. I've been overwhelmed for a couple of days. I have a lot of work and I can't even get up.
Today, I had to go outside for study purposes.
I hate going there. I have only one friend there. I can't make conversation. I always have to think of questions before I speak and it is one of the reason I haven't been able to talk to a friend for a while.
I'm bad at making friends. I try my best to find something similar to them and then hang on that thread until it eventually breaks.
Sorry for talking about that shit.
I hate a girl there. When I was younger ( I have been going to that establishment since I was thirteen ) I had friends after a few years cause we were related, but then my class changed as I was older in the class and it was not meant for me and I was stuck with people I didn't know. Another girl was with me and she made friends quickly while I didn't. I didn't make friends with any of them. I would quietly sit in the corner and study while everyone else talked. This went on for 3-4 years. I hated going but I didn't realize because it just.. felt normal.
Then another girl came into the class. ( The one I hate ) after another couple years. She made a friend in the first few days and then slowly, she made friends with everyone.
 Every class has a prominent friend group that I would describe as popular. She is in it now. I'm sure those girls wouldn't even look at me.
I'm not jealous of them because they are genuinely not good people but I wish I had friends who I could talk to similiar to how they talk with each other so comfortably.
The year she came, I had started to get along with the people because they would be talking and I'd be included because of the teacher. ( She made everyone talk together ) But then it was a new year and I was all alone again after said teacher left.
This girl I hate—she's very rude. Even to her friends. One time, we were having a party and I tried to talk about it and she whispered to another girl that I was doing too much and trying to squeeze In.
The next year, I didn't even speak when the party was happening and neither did I attend.
My one friend is my cousin. We are close but we don't have much in common. It's hard to make conversation. I have learned that I don't have boundaries when I'm with her. She has pushed me around ( physically ) and told others whatever stupid shit I say whenever I get so stressed I start being incoherent and deralious and I just let her. I know it's bad but at least I don't have to sit quietly the whole time studying.
To be honest, we don't talk a lot in class because she has also made friends with everyone even though she enetered the class after the girl I hate.
I was so upset. While I was sitting quietly, my work done, a memory came to mind. On my birthday, no one had wished me but my cousim amd it was just a happy birthday text at night 8-9 pm. The girl I consider my best friend didn't even wish me. I sent her a very long paragraph on her birthday at 12 AM. I have never been alone at school though. Not alone in the sense of I don't have friends, but I'm definitely lonely. If it wasn't for younger me who managed to make friends, I wouldn't have any right now. 
I don't have anyone to talk to cause I grew up with my mother teaching me to not speak about some things ( personal issues ). I wish I had friends. I wish I was the kind of person that would always smile but I frantically try to hold back tears. They've never been welcomed. I'm so tired. I'm so stressed, and cause I don't have anyone to talk to I'm venting here.
I am in desperate need of people I can talk to. Even at home, I can't talk to my parents or my sibling about what I'm experiencing. I've never been as close to my friends like they have been with each other. I can't do this. At school, I find it hard to talk to someone, anyone, for any reason. I can't make friends. I can't make small talk, and I'm an incredibly awkward person that can't even have conversations with others.

Is there a way to fix it? My life just feels like it's in shambles. I don't have my shit together and I feel so far behind people. I used to be better. I don't know what's wrong with me..

1mbtkeh,Anxiety made me mess up so many relationships and jobs. So I started using this technique that kinda changed my life,"**TLDR: just a super awkward, anxious girl trying to do something to help myself and others.** I stopped letting my extreme lack of social awareness hold me back and instead tried to push myself to improve it. Not a master and still super awk but sharing what worked for me in hopes it will help one of you. Consistently using this self-improvement technique literally landed me my dream job. I went from being fired because of social anxiety to just accepting the new offer yesterday!! :)

I have struggled with anxiety for years. It's ruined my relationships, made me suck at my jobs and I feel like it's just keep me so emotionally stunted. I remember feeling soooo judged in high school and college just because I could never talk as easily as other people. I'd blank out, look like I'm having a literal seizure and then just break out into a sweat. At work, it made me quiet and a poor-performer. 

Bottom line I lost my job because I couldn't communicate well. I was a ""poor performer"" on the outside but on the inside I just couldn't speak up. So instead I did this:

  
**1. Force yourself to talk out loud and record yourself** \- I read this on another reddit post and wow. It sounds cringey and stupid but hearing myself helped me realize where I need to improve and it was such a good suggestion someone made. I just use my voice recorder on my phone.

**2. Practice practice practice!** \- I explore many different apps and tools and forums until I found a few that worked really well for me. My favorite is one that let you practice conversations anonymously and gives you live feedback based on your tone, expressions, word choice etc - the stuff that actually matters when you're trying to connect with people. 

\#1 and #2 alone improved my confidence SO MUCH. Honestly even before dates.

**3. Be nice to yourself** \- all of this felt incredibly triggering and uncomfortable to me. But I was really consistent with #1 and #2 for 2 months and noticed a HUGE change in myself. Wanted to cry like 99.9% of the time but reminded myself i gotta do this. 

I hope this may help you guys because honestly i used to be so self-critical until I landed this job and realized wow... if you put in the work to kinda challenge yourself even though it's so scary, it's really possible. I feel like we can all do it!!! ",1753739527.0,238,19,socialanxiety,anxiety

I really just do cardio and didn’t think that was a problem because my weight isn’t affecting my health at all and I like getting moving.

It just made me feel so disheartened that my first time trying to actually get out of my comfort zone was met with negativity that it made me just want to give up on interaction altogether.

I'm now in my late 30s, have a wife and kids and successful career in Psychiatry. I want to give people hope, and help them in some way here. If I can. 

The Mantra that was taught to me by my father so many years ago, in middle school or high school, when I was suffering from social anxiety greatly was: **show up fully, be present and on time, do your best and don't be attached to the outcome - it was never yours to fully control.**

It's not a silver bullet exactly. But at the same time it's greatly worked to calm my nerves, ground me, and remind me that there are things I can control and things I can't. And to accept that for what it is and do my best.

So, i (21-M) have big troubles with social interactions. I can handle kinda well a conversation depending on the topic (but still facing many problems like visual contact and the way i talk), but i'm defenitively unable or at least extremadely hesitan to take the iniciative to start any kind of interaction from casual ones to basic things like agending a dentist or sending a mensage to someone, now imagine anything more complex than that. 

This happens both irl and online. I may be not so afraid about writing a post like this one, but when it comes to sending private mensages of aswering replies to me it may become worse than irl.

I belive that the clupirt here is the heavy use of internet since my preteens. I was never socially marginalized and i allways had friends at school, but for some reason i was never willing to meet em outside school. So it was easier for me just to consume content all the day instead of touching grass, the result is that i've never developed social skills.

The one work i've had so far was as cash operator, during a year until a few months. I coould manage it well because it was very simple and didn't required long intercations.

I wanted to ask for some advice or shared experiences about Effexor (venlafaxine), especially for anxiety and social anxiety.

I tried 75mg once (extended release) a while back and had an intense reaction — I didn’t sleep a single minute that night and felt super wired like I was on a recreational stimulant, had jaw clenching/grinding, and ended up having my first proper panic attack the next day. It really scared me, so I stopped right away.

Now I’m reconsidering trying a lower dose (37.5mg), but I’m nervous. I’m a highly sensitive person, have some past trauma from drug experiences (weed/MDMA/psychadelics) that left me hypervigilant, and I suspect I may be autistic. I’m worried about persistent insomnia or overstimulation happening again, especially because sleep is already fragile for me.

I’m wondering:

Has anyone had a bad first experience on 75mg and done better on 37.5mg?

Did it help with your anxiety/social anxiety in the long run?

I’ve tried joining different clubs and community organizations and have had pleasant interactions there, but it feels really hard to convert an acquaintance into a friend. The couple times I’ve asked someone to be friends directly they seemed receptive, but they either turned out to be an unkind person or just ghosted me later on.

I have a lot of “3rd spaces” near me like cafes and bars, where I see all sorts of cool people being extremely social with one another. When I enter these spaces tho, it never feels like I’m able to participate or even have an opening to introduce myself. In my mind if I had a close friend with me, I’d feel more comfortable staying in those spaces longer, and would seem more approachable and safe by virtue of not being the creepy guy sitting by himself.

While I can feel it has affected me negatively, the world feels even more overwhelming and *unfriendly* outside the security of my own bedroom. I have been outside for years and found nothing but attitudes I can't understand from other people; things that seem to be wrong but are widely accepted by everyone else. It's as if I see the world upside down, but the normalcy of the others about it prove that the inadequate one is me.

Bah. I can understand people -- It's just that the more I understand their behavior, worries, feelings, the less they make any sense and this point of view has isolated me, since apparently no one shares it. And of course, *if* they did, they would have been socially excluded, like myself. 

What's the deal with everyone else's ""common sense"", with the concept of what's ""obvious""? The obvious seems wrong. Maybe they know what's real and what's not because they have been told. I am frustrated by those conceptions, conceptions that opress, that backlash, that deceive people from other points of view, from empathy and the truth of some things. Everyone has their own opinions on each matter, I don't mind. But this wicked ""set of rules"" to follow to be integrated in society has made all of them... at least, very unkind, and unempathetic, and naïve. 

I don't want to play by them, I don't want to be like that. No one understands this impression when I bring it up and I don't know how to fully make them realize how grave this is to me and how deeply it has shaped me. Terribly pretentious observation, yes, I know. But this pattern of behavior has made me afraid to be with others because I am this different and alone in it. I can't imagine how their minds work. Of course, this is my neurodiversity talking, but in general other neurodivergent people are way more functional than me. I want to see if anyone else here feels this way about the world in general.",1753717694.0,27,3,socialanxiety,anxiety
1mbytpm,How do I continue to be proud of my accomplishments when people who have achieved more put me down and mock me for being happy with where I am?,"For example I recently started at an MMA/kickboxing gym.  I have been competing in taekwondo for years and have won national championships.  Taekwondo is point sparring but it’s also full contact- you can win by KO or by point gap. There is more safety equipment than kickboxing, we wear chest guards and head gear. 

I never brought up my taekwondo in kickboxing but the guys saw my post on Facebook.  They keep reminding me that I play a game and they are actual fighters.  I don’t disagree with them but it’s more the delivery that bothers me. If I don’t even bring it up then why do they just to cut me down? They are pro fighters and I just started kickboxing so of course they are better than me. 

I do have some habits from taekwondo that I am trying to break that are showing up in kickboxing, but that’s because I’ve done taekwondo for over a decade and kickboxing only a few months. It’s not like I’m trying to assert taekwondo into kickboxing it’s just hard to change habits. 

What do they get out of this?

Following 3 years of increasing social anxiety and low self-esteem at my first job, I finally had to quit last December.  I've been doing online therapy since February.

Lately, I've (22M) been feeling more isolated, depressed, and unmotivated, despite still living with my family.  I've never actually had an official relationship, and my few, very remote ""friends"" haven't contacted me in months, at the least.

It doesn't help that I'm always misinterpreted as rude, frustrated, or upset.  Sometimes I simply wish I never existed, and I serve ZERO purpose.  I honestly just hate my f-cking life, man.

My question here is this: What am I supposed to do? Where do I begin? How can I become more motivated and socially secure? How do I stop living the same hopeless life at home everyday? How can I focus on my decreasingly appealing career path when the unwanted longing for a relationship is on my mind?

1mc5qou,Part of a book,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share a portion of Vincent Trybou's book ""Understanding and Treating Social Anxiety,"" which I find very interesting and helpful. Here is the text:

""I'll try to explain how your illness works. Some studies show that very shy people initially have a brain that is highly reactive to emotions. This means that in you, emotions are felt very strongly, as if the brain had no filter, or as if a magnifying glass magnified them. This is thought to be due to an area of the brain, the amygdala, which is very sensitive and reacts instantly when it is triggered. This is thought to be genetic in origin and most often present from early childhood, with developments over the years. Whether it's the fear of appearing ridiculous, or inadequate, or of being rejected, of displeasing, of being seen as an idiot, of not being assertive enough, of not knowing what to say, in all cases, pathological shyness causes the same thing: talking with others makes you anxious. Doing things while others are watching you makes you anxious. Asking, arguing, or standing up to someone makes you anxious. And yet, if it were up to you, you would love to be able to hang out with all these people.

Because emotions are unpleasant in the body, you have become accustomed to avoiding contact with others or controlling your behavior, words, and emotions during discussions. You observe your body, you think about what you are going to say, you watch for any movement, phrase, or attitude that could lead to you being judged badly. And this requires constant control. You are constantly self-observing, as if you were a spectator of yourself, on the lookout for anything that could lead to your downfall and make you feel bad.

If we look closely, your greatest fear is, above all, feeling ashamed and having this sensation of shame completely overwhelm you. It's because you're afraid that your body, your words, your attitude will provoke judgment from others and therefore a feeling of shame within you that you're anxious and on the lookout for tricks. 

So we could say that social anxiety is the fear of feeling shame, as an unpleasant physical sensation. And because it's unpleasant, we're afraid it will occur, and we then engage in avoidance and control behaviors to avoid coming face to face with it. But this, in turn, keeps your amygdala sensitive.

With a sensitive tonsil, you remain fundamentally allergic. 

To treat an allergy, you need to undergo ""desensitization,"" that is, a vaccination. The tonsil needs to be vaccinated to no longer be sensitive. 

How is this different from other non-shy people? Are they never ashamed? Yes, they are sometimes ashamed, but because they accept the risk of it happening, they were able to vaccinate themselves relatively early in life. They agreed at some point in their childhood or adolescence to feel it throughout their entire body rather than have obstacles to their development and freedom of movement. They preferred to be ashamed rather than be disabled or imprisoned, and the vaccination took place.

And this is where we come to the most important point for you: could your desire to lessen your disability and live a life you enjoy be worth finally giving your amygdala the chance to get its shot? 

It's never been vaccinated against sensations, so it suffers from everything it sees. It screams in your ears as soon as a situation activates it. It suffers, and it makes you suffer. The goal of therapy is to give the amygdala what it desperately needs: a shot. And more specifically, as you've probably guessed, an anti-shame shot.

When you're injected with a vaccine, you're actually injecting a disease so that your immune system can absorb it and become more robust against it if it encounters it again. 

So you need to inject shame so that your amygdala becomes more robust against it if it encounters it again. It will then consider shame an acceptable, minimal emotion, and will be almost completely unresponsive to it, like non-shy people. You'll actually be doing what others did years and years ago, with visible success when you look at their lives.

Once the amygdala no longer has a problem with shame, there's no longer any anxiety either: it doesn't need to send you fear since it's become accustomed to shame. It's almost completely unresponsive to it. This means almost no more anxiety for you, almost no more feeling of self-observation, and almost no more brain that completely loses track of what you wanted to say because of anxiety. Almost no more feeling like you don't know what to do with your body. Almost no more anticipation in the days leading up to a meeting, nor the horrible ruminations when it goes wrong. The amygdala is vaccinated!

How are we going to implement this vaccine? There are actually two possibilities.

The first possibility is the gentle method: we meet here for about fifteen one-hour sessions and we do lots of shame exercises, progressively. There are also therapy groups with other patients, and this lasts 12 or 14 weeks, with 2.5 hours every week. It's gentle because it's progressive, but the problem is that since the vaccine is injected in small doses each time, the amygdala, unfortunately, becomes vaccinated very slowly and will remain active enough to continue to light up in the face of any risk of shame over the course of 12, 14, or 15 weeks. So the difficulty of the shame exercises is progressive, but the anxiety persists from week to week because the amygdala continues to light up. It's like antibiotics: if you take 5 days of treatment instead of 6, you miss a dose, and it doesn't work. If we use the method of applying adhesive tape to the hair, we pull it slowly.

The second possibility is the one-shot vaccine. It's always scary when we talk about it, but it always goes very well. For the first and last time in your life, you do two hours of exercises in the street where you deliberately try to be massively ashamed to vaccinate the tonsil in one go. That is, you give it the entire contents of the syringe rather than suffer for x weeks with a microdose treatment. In fact, you go from store to store in which you say horrible sentences to be sure that it will be shameful, since that's what you're looking for. The more horrible the sentence, the more the tonsil is vaccinated in a certain and decisive way. These are questions like asking for condoms at the bakery, flirting with a salesperson, talking about your hemorrhoids, premature ejaculation, or vaginismus, saying you have diarrhea, obviously using the word ""chias"" rather than diarrhea. And as we chain the exercises together, we give him the whole syringe as the minutes and stores go by. Most often, patients describe a dwelling in shame after an hour. They see that it almost completely goes down after 1h30, and that the anxiety doesn't even manage to rise again. After 1h40, patients find it funny and start to get a little bored because it's repetitive. After 1 hour and 50 minutes, we're done, and your tonsil is vaccinated. If we use the metaphor of a band-aid on the hair, we pull it sharply. Patients are amazed at what they've done and very proud, and they laugh at the stupidity of it all, telling themselves that after exercises like this, nothing can stop them in their lives. In some rarer cases, it takes a little longer, i.e., 2 hours and 10 minutes, to achieve the same result because the amygdala takes its time. Once these two hours are over, patients come back a few weeks later. The vast majority no longer have any problems, and we've completed the therapy. You're free! For some, there are more or less significant residual issues to work on. But we can't know that today because, due to the anxiety that creates a smokescreen, we don't really know how you'll function once you've had your vaccination.

And what could these more or less significant residues be? Social anxiety being a vicious disease, it sometimes tries to scam you after your two hours in the street when the amygdala has probably well and truly been vaccinated. This means that it will try to prevent the generalization process of what you have experienced. During the two hours in the street, the exercises will lead to the worst shame. They are relatively similar, that is to say, once you have reached the highest level of shame during the two hours, there is not much left above, it is played out in a handkerchief, between 9, 9.5 and 9.8 difficulty out of 10. But it will not go to 11, 14 or 18 out of 10, it is not biologically possible. The brain may work like that in anxiety, but not in shame. The worst is in a very small window and cannot go beyond the brain's capacity, that is to say 10. When you have succeeded in this, the disease will say that certain situations, obviously those to come, are worse than the exercises we will have done in the street, expressly to annoy you and to be able to restart your avoidance. It will say that such a situation is at 12, another at 14, and another at 21. This is what we call segmentation: it prevents you from having a global relationship with shame. She makes people believe that there is no ceiling in the brain.

Let's take the most classic example: doing the two hours of exercises in the stores seems impossible to you today. It's a 10 out of 10 difficulty. Once you've succeeded and seen that even 10 out of 10 is manageable, social anxiety will try to trap you, saying: ""Yes, but they were strangers you'll never see again! So it was more like a 5 out of 10 actually. Or maybe it was a 10, but in front of work colleagues, it will be a 14 out of 10! You'll panic and never recover, you'll be crimson every time you see them."" This argument is interesting, because right now, at the thought of doing the exercises at the next session, the fact that they are strangers doesn't seem to calm you down at all. So the argument works well after the exercises to break your efforts, but not before the exercises.

So, once you've done the two hours on the street, it will tell you that it was easy because they are strangers, and that it will be horrible with people you know, for example your colleagues. It will be 14 out of 10. And once you've succeeded with your colleagues and you've noticed that it was somewhere between 9 and 10, exactly like on the street, the disease will tell you ""Yes, but they are nice colleagues, it's not as if it's X or Y who are tougher and more authoritarian. There it will be 16 out of 10."" You will do it and you will see that it is also between 9 and 10. And so on. The disease does not want generalizations. It will always try to find a way to say that this is different, that what you did is 5 out of 10, and that what follows is above 10. The amygdala does not work like that. And since she will have been vaccinated, she will be less reactive than expected and will die much faster than expected. We will talk about it together again calmly if you agree to spend the two hours in the street. We must remember, whatever she says, that shame peaks at a certain point and cannot go further than what we have done in the street or in the stores.""",1753776814.0,0,1,socialanxiety,anxiety

I have moderate agoraphobia and social anxiety, with significant phone anxiety. A friend of mine has been on hospice for the summer, and I visited (12 hours away) in May to say goodbye. They remained in okay health for longer than doctors expected, and I was hoping to visit them again next week when I had time off approved. I live under the poverty line and am physically disabled so the travel is very difficult for me, but its easier emotional stress wise than phone calls. 

I tried to reach her and got no response. Checked facebook (I don't have a fb presence and have my acct un-deactivated solely to occassionally check on her) and she had posted last week that she thought her window was closing - and I missed it and my opportunity to call her again in my phone avoidance. I ended up getting in contact with her mom just now who let me know my friend is no longer lucid and had to be moved to 24/7 care because at-home hospice was no longer enough.

I know my friend understood and already had a revolving door of people reaching out. But I feel so awful for letting anxiety steal even more of my life. I wanted to hear her voice one more time and tell her I love her. Why didn't I call? I told myself if I kept pushing it off this would happen. I just want to rewind.

1mc45og,Anxiety and confliction with husbands family and friends.,"I have struggled in social situations my whole life, I'm talking about before kindergarte, all throughout school and in all jobs. I struggle to understand the things I am saying or what other are saying, then sometimes I can get too excited in jokes or joy. But I have always been known by my family as the ""bizzare child"" who will say outlandish things. Essentially I have been shamed enough for my lack of understanding in social awareness that my new mechanism is to heavily mask and be quiet. As I became an adult I would tell new people I would meet(co workers or friends) that sometimes I don't understand what I may be saying or cant catch myself, that I sometimes don't understand social ques or know how to properly respond/act, and to please let me know if I ever do or say anything so that I can be self aware. Essentially warning them ahead of time about me. 
My anxiety over meeting people has been much worse recently to the point that I avoid social situations if I can. But I am married, and I know my husband wants me to be with him to see friends and family, but I struggle. When I first met his family it was overwhelming trying to think and do what a ""normal"" person would interact like, the second I had a moment alone I burst into tears sobbing. Since then it's been consistent. Almost every social gathering I have been to with my husband I have cried thinking about something I may have said or done that was pointed out to me. I dread going to social gatherings but I force myself to go for my husband because I know he wants me to be with him. I started to learn to be quiet and only talk when addressed, and truthfully it's not any better than me talking and interacting with others that I may say something off. 
My thought process is to now to by not go with my husband to any more social gatherings or be with him on his family vacations, I'm just not a normal functioning person socially. The guilt eats me alive that this can affect my relationship, and that I need to keep forcing myself to go out. I feel guilty and deprrssed that I'm not a girl who can be normal and have fun and interact with his friends and family in a normal manner. It's become so overheleming that the thought of it makes me cry. Tomorrow my husband and their family is going tubing in the river and next week will be the family vacation wifh everyone traveling down. I always overthink it and I always have to rehearse in my head how I need to act and what to say when addressed so I don't freeze and be awkward, or even stay silent the entire time(which also does not help a person's view on me) I don't know a healthy middle. I'm am speaking to someone about these issues.  

I'm conflicted, should I go and see them to be with my husband, or do I spare him the embarrassment of being with me. These things really do ruin relationship, I'm luckily tackling it and trying to work with it. How were you guys able to overcome some of those things..? ",1753770650.0,1,0,socialanxiety,anxiety

Anxious thought -> great now i look anxious -> this persons going to think I’m weird -> why am i like this/ self hatred 

I was given some advice by a therapist to try to accept that anxiety isn’t dangerous, and we can allow ourselves to have anxiety and still be okay. I know it sounds simple but it actually REALLY helped me feel like my anxiety isn’t going to ruin my life, therefore makes me less worried about it, making me less anxious overall.

Now when I have that first anxious thought, instead of jumping to the self criticism I remind myself that I’m only doing my best, and that I’m allowed to be anxious.

In total I could invite about 10 people, and I have friends in another city and they told me they could come, but what if they cancel? What if only 2 people come? What if they think everything is too weird and embarrassing? Will they think I'm boring?

For people who have already done parties, how do you do it? How do you keep the party going for several hours?

For context, I feel ashamed of everything, I'm ashamed of everything I do, that's why I have all this anxiety to do something like this, help me with some advice :(

1masy7l,I don't have any hope for my future,"**I'm 23 years old, and I honestly don’t have any hope for my future. I have extreme social anxiety caused by past trauma. When my anxiety gets too intense, I lose the ability to speak. I don’t fully understand why — it just happens — and it turns even simple things like going to the grocery store or leaving the house into a nightmare.**

**I’m trying to figure out how I’m ever going to have a future. I can’t mentally handle having a job — it’s just too much and way too overwhelming. I’m in therapy and on medication, but even with that support, life still feels unmanageable. I really don’t know what to do.**

**On top of that, I have something called print blindness — which I’ve been told is like a severe form of dyslexia. I can’t read, write, or spell very well, and those are obviously important skills for both work and everyday life.**

1mbfjs0,Nervous wreck about an upcoming job interview – terrified I’ll ruin it,"I’ve got a job interview in 7 days and I’m already a nervous wreck. It’s with the actual company — not just a recruiter — and the closer it gets, the more I feel like I’m going to completely mess it up.

I already have a job, but I’m not really happy there. Then this vacancy popped up — offering a better salary, a much better location, better working conditions, and it’s literally the exact same work I’m already doing now. It just felt like I’d be stupid not to apply. I only sent in one application, and two days later they reached out to schedule an interview. It all happened so quickly that I feel completely overwhelmed.

I do want something new, but starting over in a completely unfamiliar environment feels really difficult. I struggle with anxiety and self-doubt, and interviews are especially hard for me. I keep thinking: what if I freeze? What if I forget everything or come across as awkward or incompetent? What if they can see how nervous I am?

Even though I want to give it a shot, part of me already believes I have a 0% chance of getting the job, and that mindset is making it really hard to prepare. I don’t know how to get my thoughts to slow down.

1mbf0gr,How to cope?,"High school was a very terrible time for me. I had to move 3 hours from my hometown to this little rural town where everybody knows each other and because of that I have NEVER fit in. People really did not like me because I was not “like them” and “I thought I was better” because I was terrified of speaking to others. Well high school was 2 years ago now and I have grown substantially in those years. Yesterday a coworker that I used to go to school with said I was very bullyable and I used to get bullied a lot in school. I was really bothered cause I had no idea what he was talking about cause I don’t remember being bullied it was just weird. So I asked what he meant and he did not elaborate much . I ended up responding that people definitely didn’t like me that much but I wasn’t bullied and responds “yeah exactly people didn’t like you that much and it was kinda your fault.” So I just stared at him for a minute waiting on him to explain which he eventually explained that everybody else talked to each other but I was just weird and quiet and “acted like I was from somewhere else”??? Maybe because I was from somewhere else but anyways..that whole conversation brought back really traumatizing memories. I went to a mental health facility literally months before starting high school my junior year. I have always dealt with major social anxiety and depression . For him to be so comfortable to tell me those things and not feel any sort of regret or worry that I would feel a way was kind of hurtful not gonna lie. I definitely expected more but he is just like all the other people from high school. The thing is once I really start to look around, everything is a reminder of how horrible life was in the past. My ‘family members’ that are from this area that I had gone to school with treat me like a complete stranger, no one addresses me as a person whenever they see me they walk straight past me in public. My entire graduating class acts like I never existed. I was never in the yearbook. And when I look back and think about it..I was bullied a lot. I am an adult now and I want to feel like that but the reminders of the past have been really difficult to deal with. I am still dealing with social anxiety right now but on a different level yet being reminded of how far back I used to be and how people treated me and assumed that I just didn’t like them and must’ve thought I was better is hard to deal with. I barely got any sleep last night and ended up waking up because this feeling is clawing at me. That I really don’t belong in this town and never did. The reason we moved was because my dad wanted to come back to his hometown which is here but just based of the way he turned out I knew it would be terrible. He was my first bully. Now everyone around me seems to act the same way he does. I really hate it here and I don’t know what to do. I don’t even want to go back to work because I felt like I’ve done more to defend myself in that moment. I never thought I would encounter so many people that felt like I was obligated to act a certain way toward them. Being in this town has been one of my biggest hardships but I grew in spite of what people told me I was, I don’t think I deserve to be reminded of how awful I was treated and how it’s “my fault”. The only reason I M still here is so I can finish college which is only in a few months but it is becoming very difficult to see these people from high school and be treated with the same animosity.

I can never really tell the vibe. I'll be overly honest, randomly start talking about something personal, accidentally ask too many questions or too little. 

The point is.. the person themselves might forget these little social mistakes. I, however, will be stuck for HOURS beating myself up about all the wrong things I said. It's genuinely exhausting.

It's worse when I'm in groups. Everyone seems to know so much better what is okay to say. Maybe part of this is autism, but I also feel like I'm judging myself more than I judge others.

1mapna7,Be a delivery driver,"Being a driver for FedEx has done wonders for my social life and social anxiety.

Before being a driver, I got extremely...extremely nervous around people, quiet and shy, and overall had a very negative self-image, especially in public. I've gone to therapy, taken meds, gotten a few jobs where I could mostly be by myself, but nothing has been as effective as being a driver for FedEx has been. 

Now I couldn't even go into stores on my own, and at one point, the anxiety got so bad that I couldn't check my mail if there was someone outside, much less go out and talk to anyone. My mind would just torture itself because another human was in proximity. I couldn't talk to anyone very well at all, and I started to get miserable.

With this job, you're forced to talk to people, to get signatures, to go into so many different businesses, and experience so many different situations throughout town. When you first start, you have to ride along with someone who's been there for a long time, so you're stuck with someone for 8+ hours a day for a couple of weeks. That got me to practice, to open up, and view myself in a more equal and positive light, because my co-workers were genuine, nice, uplifting people who saw that in me as well. I thought they would hate me, think I'm too weird, and I'd eventually get fired because they didn't like me. Exactly the opposite happened. They want to build me up, they want me to succeed, and they want me as a friend...even after putting one of their trucks into the ditch.

When you finally graduate from riding along with someone, you're out on your own, no supervisor, no one breathing down your neck, no co-workers, just yourself and the customers you talk to. It's a perfect balance if you're looking to practice being more social and doing that sort of thing, especially if you can't get out there on your own like I couldn't. I need to be forced to get out there, otherwise I'll just stay in my comfort zone. You also have a pretty outlined way of interacting since you're just the FedEx guy dropping off a package.

You also get to meet some amazing people who give you energy to keep it going throughout the day. I've met amazing country folk who take the time and energy to sincerely ask how I'm doing and meet me exactly where I am, the kindest, loving Christians, and some women who are beautiful through and through.  I've also been shouted at like I was an ignorant idiot that didn't know what I was doing by some guy in a factory, but you use those moments to adjust yourself to the harshness that exists within people and the world. At this job, you stick your head into places you would never at any other job. I've gone from a pig farm where they make pork products, and have dead pigs lying out in the sun and horror movie situations around every corner, to a greens smoothie bar right after. You just constantly have new chances to make impressions, learn from mistakes, adapt, learn, improve, etc. Even if you do something awkward in a store, you have the expectation of leaving very soon anyway. You can come back the next day more relaxed. Maybe someone else is working. Maybe it is the same person, and you just get to deal with that specific situation now. It's the perfect exposure therapy.

After a month of working, my relationships have improved, my confidence is improving, I've been far more authentic and real, my life doesn't seem so miserable anymore, I'm learning more about who I am, and remembering who I used to be. I've been having conversations with neighbors, attractive women, and coworkers, but I still struggle to go into stores on my own. When I'm with someone, though, it is far easier than it ever has been. I used to shy away from everyone, rush dialog options due to anxiety, and crave escaping into my room. Now, I'm more relaxed in my own self. I respect myself. I use the time on the road to reflect on who I am and what I'm doing instead of numbing all of that out with YouTube videos, junk food, etc. If I'm super people pleasy, or something feels super weak inside of me when I'm acting a certain way in public, or just what I see in the world seems very sad, self hating, or I think people are making fun of me, I sit and question why this is the way I see the world, not take it to be true. This has proven to be ultimately beneficial and what I was missing in my life. The perspective changes are wild. I sometimes forgot I was a human being in the world, and often defaulted to being in my head, controling my body and trying to control my life, but now i realize I am actually a human and it is such an amazing awesome beautiful thing to hold this much grace, responsibility, potential, intelligence on such a planet in a universe. Being me is such a psychedelic experience. Sometimes I forget I'm driving a truck and default to anxiety and control, and the world begins to look flat again, and the people seem very hostile, and then I remember I'm in a truck, holding such responsibility, and the reality of my situation comes to life again and there's a peace, a self respect, and self control that ensues. Instead of feeling thin and flimsy, I feel thick and self-assured. Maybe that makes no sense, but I always used to live from the eyes of other people, and now I'm living from my own. 

So all of that is to say, if you need a job, and want to get over social anxiety, join a FedEx or UPS or something and do your best to engage and be the best you can be. ",1753631339.0,30,3,socialanxiety,anxiety

I grew up as the only native american kid in a pretty much all white small town. Anyways these last few years, between establishing myself, taking care of my brother, and my already horrible social anxiety, I've managed to make a few friends, but none that I would say are close by any means. More like acquaintances that are really nice almost

They are nice good people i would wish to be closer with i could really use advice for that but my main reason for the post is that ive been really struggling with my loneliness lately and feeling of never being loved. And its been coming out in self harm and panic attacks, thoughts of ending things. I really wish I had someone to talk to and tell about how I've been feeling. Right now it feels like i have no one

So how close do you have to be to someone to tell them about those things? I feel like normally I would only share that with my closest friends but I really don't have any of those anymore. They are really nice people but I also don't want to trauma dump or make them uncomfortable with me.

So recently I started talking to a coworker more (22F), one day we talked about boys and my sexuality (I’m bi she asked). It came up that sometimes I struggle to find friends after being homeschooled in my teens. Anyway eventually the club came up and she mentioned I could join her and her friends (also coworkers) next time she had a Halloween club event. I got her instagram and we talked there too. The conversation ended when she asked how I act when I’m drunk and I told her  sometimes I start speaking Japanese and she asked why, I explained due to my language learning anxiety that disappears when I’m drunk. That was it. I didn’t think too much of it. Next time I saw her at work I waved and she just gave me like a nonchalant grimace or something.  Mind you when we started talking more I remember her not hearing me say hi to her at first as she passed and when she heard me she apologized and gave me a hug. Fast forward for about 2 weeks straight while I’m suddenly invisible I noticed she doesn’t interact with my instagram even when my b day came up, but she always views my story. Every single last one. Meanwhile ever since I got her insta suddenly she started calling me by a different name and when asked to cover for a coworker she said who’s that is that you? These names are nowhere near alike. We’ve been working together for 8 months and I wear a name tag. The coworker she confused me with twice  literally started like a month ago. I swear she was saying my name correct she may have asked if she was saying it right but she’s known my name for awhile.

This isn’t the first time this has happened to me. I’ve had this issue since I started working at 16 but what is up with this reaction? It stresses me out because I don’t know how I should react. People will be really friendly for months, days, weeks then all of a sudden it’s like I’m invisible for a few weeks then I’m not and it repeats. We aren’t close so I’m like she doesn’t owe me anything but at the same time I don’t know if I should just shift to match her mood(s)? If I make eye contact do I just look away or do I wave?

1mb8guz,"Tall Poppy Syndrome as an INFJ/""Strong Silent Type""","\*\*\* I DO NOT EXPECT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND \*\*\*

If you read this and interpret my issues as petty, insignificant, or narcissistic you will only be further perpetuating them. If you can't put yourself in my shoes and at least understand where I'm coming from and empathize a little bit, please, do not comment. It's not often I speak candidly like this so getting lots of backlash would probably kill me.

First a little context:

I am a 23 year old male, recently graduated from college with a degree in mechanical engineering. I landed a job right out of school with the company I had interned with for 2 years prior. School was close to home, along with my friends and family of course, and now work is too. I was active in many clubs and sports that kept me fulfilled and happy throughout. I grew up in many of the social circles that still surround me to this day, (elementary, middle, and high school friends).

I tend to be naturally good at a lot of things, both in athletics and academics. I naturally succeed where many others fail. I attribute this mainly to my extremely intuitive nature. I think I am just able to mimic things which I have seen in the past with stupidly high accuracy.

when I combine all this with my fairly stoic/quiet personality and a naturally confident demeanor, I think I often come off as intimidating to others. The ""strong silent type"", if you will. If you're into typology, the standard INFJ personality type suits me very well.

This all sounds good on paper I'm sure, but there's this under the hood emotional erosion happening. Not enough to crash the car, but enough that I feel it every damn time I hit a bump.

The problem:

Every time I outshine someone, friends, family, or strangers, I get comments hinting to me that people think I am arrogant, narcissistic, or straight up better than others. This couldn't be further from the truth. I want nothing more than for those around me to succeed and even surpass me, so I try to help people where ever I can. I like to think that I am kind and courteous to everyone. I say ""please"" and ""thank you"", encourage and help people when they look like they need it, and I have always tended to avoid conflicts as much as possible. I typically take criticism really hard so avoiding it has always seemed like the best option even though I know it can be unhealthy.

I get it, having someone seemingly effortlessly surpass you is frustrating, and people that do easily surpass the majority often come as a package deal with one of those bad traits I mentioned in the previous paragraph. But I genuinely don't think I fit into that category. It like I hit this intersection where high capability meets high emotional sensitivity, so I know not to be a jerk about my natural talents.

Although this post hasn't reflected it much, I am a very humble person. I'm never rubbing anything in their face. I'm just being myself, and that’s still enough to trigger others. It is very hard for me when my close friends constantly root against me, both seriously or jokingly. I never know how to respond. I would hate to point out that they are just insecure in moments like these, because like I said earlier I am extremely conflict avoidant. I end up just saying nothing or smiling and pretending like they’re just joking around, even though I know deep down they aren’t.

It's like I'm living in a loop where my empathy shields them from discomfort, but no one’s doing the same for me, and honestly, it's fucking lonely...

More and more I want to distance myself from them, fearing that my mere existence will shatter their ego, yet I can't. These groups are long term friends that have always been good to me in every other context. I doubt they even know that they are killing me inside every time they celebrate my failure.

If anyone knows how I can fix my ""Tall poppy syndrome"" without having to sand myself down, please offer any advice you may have.

1mava1t,Socially anxious and made a huge mistake,"I tend to be very socially anxious and do everything I can not to offend or be an issue to anyone.

I went to the gym this weekend as I usually do. After I had finished using a machine, I went to get some paper towels to wipe it down, but I came back to the wrong machine instead, the one next to the one I was using. This happens pretty often because both machines look identical and are right next to each other. Usually I catch myself before I wipe the wrong one but I didn’t this time.

I wiped it down and reached to grab what I thought was my phone and keys as they were sat on top exactly as I always do my own.

But they weren’t mine, I didn’t realize this until I was starting to reach for them and at that moment, a man yelled “HEY!” and grabbed them from in front of me, giving me a look that made me want to melt.

I was immediately upset, and started apologizing profusely that I genuinely mistook it from my machine, but he just stomped off and refused to even acknowledge me. I was just a piece of trash and we was mister perfect.

Of course I looked like a criminal, and I was afraid I was going to be thrown out, and everyone was staring at me.

This is why I hate going out in public, everyone seems to get offended and hates me and acts like I’m up to no good, even though I’ve been told by people that know me that I’m the most polite person they’ve ever met and they know I’d never steal a thing.

I really hate being treated as some criminal, but it was an honest mistake, and yet there’s nothing you can do to redeem the situation, in his mind I’m Some creep, so I am to him and everyone that was there.

1mb07bj,Express Lane Altercation,"My husband and I went to the grocery store together - something we haven't done in about a year because we usually shop online and we don't usually have a day off together. Today we did so we went. We got our normal amount of items, maybe 35 items. We had some items that had a discount stickers on them so instead of doing self checkout, we went to a cashier. There were only two lanes open so without really thinking or looking around we just picked the one that was empty. We unloaded our cart and everything seemed normal. Well halfway through the cashier ringing us up, an elderly lady got behind us in line. I'm still not thinking anything about it until she says in a clearly irritated tone ""can't you read?"" I look at her and say ""what?"" And she goes ""don't you know how to read? This is the express lane"" so I look up and sure enough I'm in the express lane. I say ""oh, sorry, I didn't know"" and she says ""yeah, you people are so selfish"". I didn't even look at her. I just pretended I didn't hear her but my cheeks got so hot and I started sweating. Mind you the cashier never said anything to us beforehand either. And if she had, my husband and I would have been understanding and would've went to a different line. We both genuinely were just kind of having a good time together and didn't look up to read a sign. Plus this was aisle 3 not aisle 1 which is typically the express line. 

I was clearly in the wrong for being in the express lane with way more than 15 items but it was an honest mistake and her words were very hurtful. Now I'm gonna be thinking about this for the rest of my life and I feel like such a terrible person. Like maybe I am really selfish. Maybe I need to do better.

1mawsps,Need advice for talking to customers,"I’ve had severe social anxiety my entire life. It’s been really rough, but after 13 years of therapy (and counting) I’ve gotten a lot better. I still feel anxious in social situations quite a bit, but now I can actually speak when I’m anxious while interacting (I used to have selective mutism) and not feel like everyone is staring at me all the time. 

I recently got a job at a local cafe, and I’m pretty nervous. I’ve gotten better at small talk with strangers/acquaintances, but I still feel really uncomfortable and I think i compensate by overdoing my attempt to appear like a friendly customer service worker (although I have no idea if other people actually notice). I lean really hard into the friendly voice and big smile, and I don’t know if it seems disingenuous or weird. It doesn’t help that I’ve never worked at a cafe before, so I’m learning a bunch of new and overwhelming things while I’m adjusting to this role. 

Has anyone here worked customer service roles and has any advice? This could be stuff like how to cope, reframing things, good examples of small talk/how to relate to customers, or anything else you can think of.

1mb1uko,Work Bestie?,"This is a long one but I want to include as much as I can for context. Nothing to come across in a certain way, just factual. 

I have been at my career for about 7 years. I have not found many people my age that I’ve connected with or been able to hang out with outside of work. I live in a city I’m not originally from and never really found “my group.” This past year we got a new coworker around my age. We had similar personalities, interests, viewpoints. We ended up bonding over mutual dislikes of other coworkers (of course). With her being newer in the field, I offered to help her at many times as a mentor when others didn’t. She was always appreciative and I thought we had a solid friendship formed. I thought someone was genuinely liking me for me as a friendship. *disclaimer* she does have a partner that is another female and I have a partner that is a male. I have only come across as a friendship because I am happily married and have no desire to go in that direction. Her partner has made us baked goods specifically for my family. We were invited to their elopement celebration. 
We never hung out outside of the workspace. There was once we had an issue with a person at work and I texted her that evening about it and the next day she made the comment “wow we text a lot.” But I did not think it was any different than I’ve texted other coworkers. As the time went on, she shared she was moving to a new location and even suggested I come too. I decided I genuinely needed a change and made it clear I was applying to other locations but we ended up in the same place. She seemed so genuinely excited that we would be working together and were “work besties.” She said we would be hanging out before the transition to our next work location started. When that time happened, she’s been extremely aloof in texting me. Almost two word responses. I’ve only texted about the new location/work stuff. Not even back to back— I’m talking a few days a part. When I even suggested grabbing lunch, I got no answer. We will be in group chats with other previous coworkers and she’d respond right away. I am now feeling like any time I reach out I’m being “too much.” I feel extremely uneasy going into this new workspace where we only know each other and I previously was looking forward to it. I genuinely don’t know how to “move” with this scenario: am I over thinking it and I should act like nothings wrong or continue on with giving her space and act like we barely know each other?

1maciw0,I can’t get a job,"I just turned 24 and I’ve never had a job. I’ve gone to many interviews and applied to probably 200+ listings, but I either never hear anything back or I get rejected. 

In high school and after, my mental health was extremely poor. I never wanted to leave the house or achieve anything in my life because I hated myself. I’ve always been very introverted and I tense up in social situations.

A problem I face is I visually come across as anxious. My face gets red and I sweat pretty badly (doesn’t help that I have rosacea). My body language isn’t the best either. I bite and lick my lips and sometimes dart my eyes even when I don’t intend to. I know all of this and I tell myself what I need to change, but when I get to the actual interview I crumble. 

I’m simply looking for an entry-level position. I’m trying to put myself out there for the first time in years and make some money to start some future endeavors, possibly even find a career path. It’s been impossible so far.

I’ve been trying since March. Maybe that isn’t too long and I should just be patient, but I don’t want to keep wasting my life. 

It probably also doesn’t help that I’m overweight. I’m on a calorie deficit and go to the gym and I’ve lost some weight. I’m far from where I want to be, though. Not saying I know for sure that I got rejected based off of my weight, but I can’t exclude the possibility.

1mai5rv,Does social anxiety ever truly go away?,"((read post before commenting please))
Kinda venting and this is more for those that have SAD 

I got diagnosed with SAD when I was 17 and suffered from it since I was 12. Social anxiety made me extremely depressed and I was also quite sui___al.I even dropped out of high school during senior year bc i went from having anxiety attacks everyday before school to then having them at school too. It sucked.

I am now 24 and don’t get anxious at things that used to make me feel anxious anymore like going to parties,going to the store,ordering my own food, or wearing mix matching socks…( I had a fear of someone making fun of me for it or just pointing them out…anxiety makes us think weird things ik and i feel like a lot of you here can relate and won’t judge me for it 😭) I no longer feel like everyone around me is judging me for some made up reason in my mind 

I now go to festivals and concerts alone and it’s one of my favorite things to do. I also love going out now which is crazy to me because I didn’t want to leave my house at all not even 4 years ago 

Anyways I don’t know if I still have it or can say I have it?? Like does it ever even truly go away? (Seriously asking) i still get anxious at times but it always stays at a 1-3 when it was 10+ before. And yes these things that make me anxious are still social anxiety related (?).like the most common one for me is just getting anxious over something I said in a conversation an hour ago or even a few hours ago that I think I said wrong or said awkwardly etc. I learned how to calm myself down so my anxiety usually doesn’t last long but it still happens once a week or so  

I just feel weird saying I don’t have social anxiety anymore like it just doesn’t feel right because it was a big part of my life for so long but I also feel like such a big phony if I say I do because its no longer as bad as it used to be and I also do a lot of things those with SAD get anxious to do without anxiety. I feel like one of those people that is scared to ask for ketchup in a restaurant and says they have social anxiety due to that reason alone if you get what I mean. Its so confusing and this is something I never thought I would ask myself tbh  (edit: I meant I never thought I will ask myself if I still have social anxiety bc trust me I’ve asked myself “does social anxiety ever go away?”THOUSANDS of times lol)

1maoxha,My advice on talking with ANYONE (even as an introvert),"I've been very uncomfortable and awkward with other people. I could never grasp what it means to hold normal conversations. But here are my 4 tested tips on how to get out of your own head, and own conversations with absolutely anyone, even as an introvert.

Everyone knows this situation. A party. Work. A new group at university. You sit next to someone, smile, and say “Hey.”

...Now what?

I used to sit there, over analyzing every thought like a detective at a crime scene. Is this funny enough? Will I sound like a total weirdo?

And guess what?

The more I filtered myself, the quicker I spiraled into cringe-mode. But then I had a realization:

I couldn’t remember the last time I had judged someone for trying to start a conversation with me.

I mean—life’s too short to obsess over what strangers might think. Still… that didn’t magically stop me from freezing up when I wanted to talk to someone. So I knew I had to find a system that actually worked. And eventually, I found 4 small things that made talking to anyone so much easier.

**1. The 3-second rule**

Even when I felt like I had nothing to say, my brain was noticing things:

Cool hairstyle. Funny shirt print. Weird keychain. Maybe the person was dressed in a unique way. Or we were in a specific type of setting.

So... why not just comment on that?

That’s when I started using the 3-second rule:

If I notice something interesting, I give myself just 3 seconds to say the first question or comment that comes to mind.

If I wait longer, the moment vanishes, and the panic kicks in. This stops overthinking dead in its tracks and forces me to act. And honestly?

What you say doesn’t matter nearly as much as the fact that you say something. People want to respond if they feel you’re genuinely curious. Now… does that mean I just blurt out anything that pops into my head?

Yes.

No. 😅

Obviously there are limits. But with just a little bit of social intuition, you’ll be fine. It’s not that you don’t know what to say. It’s that your anxiety blocks you from saying it.

**2. Ask questions that don’t suck**

Let’s say you do manage to start the conversation. Now what?

The biggest shift I made was changing how I ask questions.

Instead of: ➡️ “Where do you work?” Ask: ➡️ “How do you spend most of your time?”

Instead of: ➡️ “Did you like your vacation?” Ask: ➡️ “What did you enjoy the most?” or “How did you decide to go there?”

Trust me—answers to those kinds of questions are so much deeper and more interesting. Open-ended questions are like fishing nets. They don’t just catch one-word answers—they pull in stories.

**3. Actually listen**

Most people don’t really listen. They’re just waiting for their turn to talk.

When someone says: “I went kayaking this weekend.”

You think: “Cool.” But stop. There’s so much more there!

Where did they go? Who with? Was it hard? How was the weather? Do they love that kind of thing?

There’s a goldmine of follow-up material in every sentence.

Here’s my trick:

Be genuinely present.

Don’t just listen to respond—listen to understand. If you’re truly curious, your brain will give you more questions. You just need to let it. And once you actually start listening...

**4. Remember small things — it’s magic**

People love when you remember stuff about their lives. If someone tells you they’re moving—ask them next time how it went. Remember it. Write it down if you need to.

At one point, I literally kept a small notebook with little things people told me—just so I could follow up later. There’s nothing more powerful than being that person who remembers. It transforms a basic convo into a real, deep, and lasting connection.

So go ahead—be that person. But please… don’t tell anyone I gave you this trick 😅

**Final tip: Sometimes it just won’t work. And that’s okay.**

No matter how good you get at talking, sometimes people just won’t vibe. They might be tired. Distracted. Not in the mood. Or just… not great conversationalists.

And that’s perfectly fine. Not everyone has to like you. You don’t even like everyone.

When you feel that the other person just isn’t interested—let it go. Treat every conversation like practice.

When you walk away, ask yourself: “What could I do better next time?”

Instead of stressing over how dumb you sounded—which you probably didn’t.

Don’t force a dead conversation. Sometimes, it’s just not meant to flow.

These little mindset shifts helped me go from the shy guy who overanalyzed everything, to someone who genuinely loves talking to strangers.

Hope they help you too.

1majtbv,Is this a normal symptom?,"This is my first ever public(ish) post on any sort of social media account so sorry if its incomprehensible or whatever.

I'm 15F and I'm not really diagnosed with social anxiety disorder but I highly suspect that I do have it considering a lot of other symptoms that align with symptoms I've seen on multiple sources as well as this subreddit such as: constant nausea/paranoia/butterflies in my stomach when being out in public, hot flashes when thinking about having to socialize, crying when having to socialize, avoidance of eye contact, isolation from friends and family, phone anxiety, flashbacks(?) to old embarrassing moments that I've had...

And more that I don't feel like explaining because this is almost a decade of having a whole lot of symptoms. As well as my doctor saying that she believes I have social anxiety too after finding out about my AI addiction :/

But, the point of my post is to ask if having a fear of cameras in your home is normal with social anxiety or if this is some sort of schizophrenia or other explainable anxiety/paranoia disorder.

It's not something that I've experienced for a long time but I've been noticing it more often that I've been overly aware of mirrors, windows, and my phone camera at times.

I catch myself avoiding mirrors and realigning any sort of camera near me a lot of the time because I'm afraid someone is watching me somehow and things like that. I try to limit my time in the shower too because I feel as though there's cameras in the shower head (Like... that sounds so weird... what?)

I'm not sure if it's a result of my mom adding a ring camera into our living room and now I've just subconsciously started watching out for surveillance around my house at all times.

All I know is that I want to be medicated or something to make this stop. I hate all of this but I'm also afraid of therapy because that requires socialization and it's just too much to handle at once. As well as me going into my sophomore year, I feel like there's just too much change happening in my life at once and that's probably making it worse.

I just really hope I don't sound crazy because it's a genuine fear of mine and I don't know if I'm losing my mind. Yeah... I hope that makes sense, please give me advice. Thank you.",1753615162.0,2,5,socialanxiety,anxiety

1ma6nfz,I'm 20 and I'm failing at life.,"I turned 20(F) four months ago and social anxiety has prevented me from accomplishing anything even close to what my peers have at this age. I am so behind in life that I believe I have failed.

I am currently enrolled in my 3rd year at college and have basically done nothing except for coast along in school. I had a part time job for around 2 months but the anxiety was so bad that I couldn't take it anymore; I felt like i became incompetent when faced with customers, especially when they were rude or antsy. I would often freeze up and forget everything I learned in training when the pressure got past a certain threshold. I have tried applying to jobs since then but NO luck. I also have not been able to get an internship because I do not know people and I have not networked whatsoever because I am so fearful that I am not good enough. Overall, I feel pretty incompetent, especially socially. When speaking to people I never know what to say, and this only contributes to the idea that I might just be completely stupid. Even when interacting with people I'm close to, I overthink every single word and gesture- which results in me seeming incredibly bland. 

I've had social anxiety for almost my whole life. As a child I was diagnosed with selective mutism (which was hell in itself), and then as I got older the diagnosis became social anxiety. I have gone through years of therapy and medication and it definitely helped a little, but I would say I have given up on therapy because after countless years I am tired of hearing about all the ""tools"" I already know about. I want to dedicate my future to helping people like myself, with medication, but at this rate, I don't think this will be a possibility for me because of how behind I am. I am just so scared of being myself and being perceived by other people and I have had no relief from this ever. My appearance doesn't help, I wouldn't say that I am ugly but there are a lot of things about me physically that I hate and fixate on. I am worried that at this rate I wont be able to get any part time job or internship to advance my skills and I won't be accepted into a graduate program (which is what I really want to do- I want to be a doctor, but I think this dream may be completely out of reach). All of my peers are getting ahead and preparing for their careers and I am just... here. 

Truthfully, I feel like a child, and a complete disappointment. I'm not sure I was made for this life thing at all and I often consider ending it but I can't because it would ruin my little brothers life, whom I love too much.",1753570114.0,19,2,socialanxiety,anxiety

I've considered trying some basic dance classes because I feel like maybe that would help me loosen up, but I feel so awkward and embarrassed trying to dance even when I'm just home by myself.
Can anyone relate? Is there a term for this, or another disorder that I can look into, because I feel like it goes beyond typical social anxiety disorder",1753571481.0,11,3,socialanxiety,anxiety

I got really good grades and I was about to get a scholarship for the next year but then my mom got really sick when I was in college and I had to drop out to take care of her. She passed away 4 years ago, and I became a shut-in after a pretty bad mental health crisis. My family has been supportive of me but I really need a job because our financial situation is bad now. I'm feeling lost and I do not know what to do. I have nothing to show for those 4 years and every job listing I see requires at least one year of experience or a degree. The few friends I still have all have completed their degrees and have their own place and careers started while I'm lagging behind.

1m9waoz,Pushing myself to put myself out there makes me worse,"I went to a concert by myself like few days ago in a big city. I'm not only scared of big crowds but also public transportation especially by train. I managed to hop on one but got a panic attack and got off which caused me to be late. But the second try was successful. When I got to the event I stood outside for a bit. My legs were like jelly and I really considered  leaving but some people came right after me so I just decided to follow them. The place was absolutely packed and I was very disoriented. I went to buy some beer and I was shaking when the guy asked me for ID. Once I settled I just enjoyed the concert but I got really sad seeing all the other people who were much cooler than me and those who were with friends. I felt like an alien. Like an object that's not supposed to be there. It was an underground alt concert so all of them were different but I still couldn't fit in. I got jealous of all the women there they were mad attractive like I'm talking ethereal. And I realized that I'm not special and I understood why I'm never chosen. Why the hell would I ever be? When there's so many better  options out there. Prettier, cooler, more creative, more social. I left feeling absolutely small and dejected. On the way back some group sat next to me. I had no choice but to listen to conversations and they were so relatable. In my mind I was just screaming yes oh my god me too. But I didn't manage to say anything only played small and pretended like I don't exist. After they've gone away I just cried until I got home. I guess going somewhere even if you're afraid is a win but I don't think I'm going to be doing that again any time soon. I don't see the point if my insecurity is just going to ruin it for me.

1m9rsld,24 M no friends and no plans on weekends.,"I find the weekends extremely dull and depressing because im always sat at home alone playing video games or watching movies. I never have any plans or anyone to see and it can get really lonely. I do go to the gym and workout since it can be less crowded compared to weekdays but I feel like I literally have no life. I work full time 9-5 Monday to Friday so it can be nice to relax and recharge away from people for a couple of days, but its not good long term as im not meeting any new people or making any new connections etc.  It's also really depressing when people at work ask what my plans for the weekend are and I always have to say ""nothing"" whereas others are out living their lives with friends and family etc. I feel like im the only boring guy around who never leaves his house apart from for work and shopping. I have tried to reconnect with old friends from school/college but they don't reply to my messages so i give up.

Of course Social Anxiety (SA) plays a huge role in this. I have used the meetup app to try to find some groups such as cinema visits and walks etc. It really does frighten me to go to these events alone, although I have managed to go to a few. The people i meet are really nice but nothing happens afterwards, no socials/contact details are exchanged due to the awkwardness of the encounters. I would assume the others attending the groups also have SA themselves  Also, i don't drink alcohol and although there are events where drinking isnt involved, (cinema and walks etc,) often the host organises drinks at a bar afterwards where i have to leave the event early etc. I then feel rude about having to leave everyone abruptly. Some events such as book clubs which im interested in take place in a pub where im too uncomfortable too attend due to the venue.

I don't have any confidence when it comes to dating because of my physical appearance and its hard to connect with someone who doesn't have any friends. A girl would probably wonder that there is something wrong with me.
I feel like im just living to work and not working to live. Has anyone been in this situation before and have any advice? Thanks.",1753531928.0,15,8,socialanxiety,anxiety

I've had debilitating social anxiety for years, so I used this a lot to cope. I decided I should quit after realizing how many bars I was taking a day and that it would just keep getting worse. I opened up to my mom to ask for help to try and go about dealing with my issues in a healthier way. She's very supportive and cares a lot.

It's been a year that I've been seeing my psych now, and have made very little progress. Constantly trying new SSRI's, antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, gabapentinoids. It's extremely discouraging and just making me feel hopeless. The Pregabalin she prescribed was helping a bit at least, but my script ran out and I haven't been able to refill it until I see her.

I couldn't handle it n gave in, deciding to get pick up some Xanax again to manage my anxiety. I know I'm not good at controlling my urges to use it, so I told myself I'll only take a bar when I need it. I was never comfortable going to gym, even on Pregabalin, so decided to take a bar n see how I felt about it. Of course, it worked and I got extremely motivated like never before just feeling all those worrying thoughts wash away. It was that rush of feeling ""normal"".

Problem is, it's only been a week and I'm already through 30 bars :( I'm such a dumbass, making excuses for why I need it to help calm me down then feel bad about it after. It really does help though and that's why it bothers me so much that I'm such a degenerate about it. I just wanna feel comfortable existing :(

I’m a 20-year-old guy, quite introverted, and I struggle to meet new people. The only real friendships I’ve built “on my own” were back in high school, with three classmates I spent a lot of time with every morning at school. After high school, I stayed friends with only one of them. The rest of my friends are from a beach group I see pretty much only in summer.

Now I’m starting my third year of university, and I still haven’t met anyone new. It doesn’t really make me feel bad, since I’m not the type who likes going out often — I prefer quiet and occasional moments with others — but I have this constant feeling that my life is pretty flat, with no big ups or downs, just passive. Sometimes I wonder if I’m missing out on something, but I don’t know how to change the situation.

I’d really like to break out of this, but I don’t know where to start. Does anyone have advice or similar experiences to share?

I’ve been doing side jobs in the meantime. I did work at the Walmart DC for 3 months but I quit bc I hated it and the people there. 

I just feel like such a failure. I want to go back to Amazon again. I am afraid to look for other jobs because they are always customer focused. My social anxiety is still higher than ever. I’m 27 man. 

I am eligible to be rehired but they are not hiring at the moment. It would my third time going back. The first time I quit bc they wouldn’t accept my personal leave. 

I wouldn’t blame my parents for being disappointed in me. I have an associates degree and didn’t do anything with it. I was going to go back in 2019 for my bachelors, but then Covid happened. I just gave up ever since then. With AI, I definitely give up on the graphic design route now. I don’t even know what I want to do with my life. 

I just want to love myself. I just want to ignore the voices in my head. But I am never doing anything productive. I am always too scared. I have made some progress but, I’m always just so worried about my parents. Especially my mom, I seem to always want her approval. I know she is mad at me for being jobless and I don’t blame her. Right now, I sell on eBay to make some money. I learned how to sell online and it was a nice journey in itself for me, so at least there’s that.

1m9on0b,What Sounds Can Be Absolutely Heard through medium-ish walls?,"Hello! I have had pretty bad social anxiety since I was 8. The situation I find myself in happens more often than I'd like so I'm posting this here in hopes of getting some possible methods of navigating it.

I'm currently on a trip visiting a family member, who as of now is sleeping in the room next to mine. Now, I'm one of those artist types that whenever I'm creating, the majority of the process is pacing or some sort of movement. And of course, my lovely brain has to start obsessing (and I mean obsessing) on a new project I'd started recently. I'm getting constant new ideas and solutions and inspiration.

If I try to lay down, I get RLS. So my options are pacing around on the tile flooring while trying my best to tip toe, or rustling around crawling on the bed from notebook to notebook. 

What do you think will make the least amount of noise? 

My anxiety is just having a field day by not allowing my body to stay still and simultaneously obsessing over every sound I make. Send help.

When I fidget, it’s nothing crazy, usually just picking at the skin around my nails to cope with my anxiety. 

The issue is, I usually go to places like target or CVS, but if I take more than a minute to look at something I always end up having an employee go into my aisle. I’ll usually notice that same employee “following” me to another aisle or two, maybe by coincidence, but more likely I feel they’re trying to make sure I don’t shoplift. None of them ever try to say hi to me, or even ask if I need any help looking, which would put me at ease, but sometimes I do feel them glancing at me in my peripheral.

1m97bie,A thought on Social Anxiety,"I have had social anxiety since before it had a name and I was just musing on it and what it was like when it first reared its head. What I remember is that around 12-13 years, I began to feel a state of what I would call heightened arousal when in a setting like a classroom, a school hallway, sitting next to peers. When I read the definition of SA it describes it as, broadly speaking, a fear of being judged and I wonder if in some sense this is really just the brain trying to make sense out of what is happening and then in a circular way reinforcing the phenomena. What I mean is that while I don't remember feeling particularly judged or even initially self-conscious, what I do remember is an overwhelming *sensation,* with no visible explanation. The sensation alone was not terror exactly, though unpleasant and overwhelming, but is probably similar to what would be appropriate if being chased by a lion. What I wonder is if the acute feelings of self consciousness, the acutely negative feelings of being judged, the hyper-vigilence, are a result of my brain having to make sense, appoint a causation to the sensation.  My pop-neurology understanding of cognition is that a lot of the time your brain/body is making snap decisions that make big physiological changes before you even know what is going on and the feelings you get, (of terror, dread, rage etc.,) are a response to those changes, (like a flood of adrenilin etc.)

Unfortunately the repetition and association have cemented the understanding that the arousal is synonymous with the fear so one engenders the other without regard to what is ""real,"" as a phobia does in a person who is say phobic of spiders might not believe that they are actually mortally dangerous but responds physiologically as though they are.

1m91nob,Feeling the need for wanting good friends (ADHD/autistic),"

Hi. I've been diagnosed with autism (and ADHD) for pretty much my whole life and I had been dealing with it in ways that always made me feel like I was indifferent from other people. 

For years I've always felt weak, I do have a way of talking about it it's just that I don't know how to get my exact expression out there or word in a way that makes the most sense, it's just one of the things I've struggled with.

I tried talking about it with family and friends but they all don't really seem to take it the right way, they always misconstrue most of the things I say and always just tell me to stop worrying about it or brush it off, it always has been stressful getting regulated on it, but now I feel like I have somewhat a slightly better handle, even if it's not perfect, I'm still managing it.

I've never fully gotten like a friend or someone to give me good advice on how I should be able to do it the correct way, I went to like a couple of places seek out people who have the same disabilities as I do but not many of them really seen that interesting to talk with or seem to be on a similar level as me.

So I don't really know where else to turn to other than just being here for the time being I guess, I really just want people to interact with that house ADHD / autism and could be able to speak in a way that makes them seem like they're genuinely interested in talking.

Note: I'm not the best at typing things in a clear concise paragraph, (part of that is me doing it too quickly which causes my sentences to look scewed at times), but I'm trying to do it where it can be worded in a way that makes the most sense at least).

1m8tjco,NO is a full sentence,"I just remembered this story so I wanted to share it with y’all. And that is, it is ok to say no to an event or get-together. Let me tell you my story:

I’ve talked about my overall story on here before. You can look at my profile and search  up my social anxiety story if you’re interested.

Either way, I’m about to start my sophomore year of college (19M) so this wasn’t long ago. I don’t do well at other people’s houses or events, usually only family. So in HS, you can imagine the grad party nightmare. Yeah I’m not doing any of that.

I didn’t RSVP to anything. Do you want to know what my grad party was? A merger party with my cousin my age who socialized with all her friends (I didn’t have any of mine over) while I was on the couch on my phone occasionally talking to a close relative. And I don’t regret it 

Either way, it was ceremony day. Now I was WIPED. After walking the stage, lunch with my family, and running errands, I was drained socially and physically. (Now this was a year ago so take how this went with a pinch of salt, but this is somewhat how it went) I think I got a call or text from a friend saying that I should come to a her party like 20 minutes away. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I think I forgot she had one. Not only do I not feel like driving rn, I also want to protect my peace. She was like, “you need to at least stop by, so and so friend who used to come to our school is here” 

Yeah that so-and-so friend, yeah I saw him earlier that day at the ceremony. No im not coming.

Then I proceed to get a text from my best friend telling me to get over here. Told him the same thing his response was: “No resting, get your heinie over here, so and so friend is here” now I’ve known him for years so ik he’s joking, but I was also kinda pissed. 

And then I got a voicemail. This voicemail was everyone basically like, “get over here” but in a very joking way/tone. I was over it at that point so I just turned off my phone and went to bed. Tbf, I haven’t opened to much about my anxiety to them, but still.

I understand that they were mostly joking, but no should’ve been enough.

I tell you this story cause I think it’s important to remember that it is ok to say no. You don’t OWE anyone anything. Don’t try and make up a random excuse as to why you can’t go to something. It’s ok to decline. “But it hurts their feelings 🥺” yeah… idc. You are a human not an obligation to grow someone’s ego.

Please remember this if you’re ever in this situation. You deserve the best, and you are allowed to have boundaries.

1m8wc4o,What can I do to better support my partner with social anxiety?,"I have a lovely partner who has let me know that he has social anxiety. It developed at around his early teens, and as a result, it made him miss out on a lot of things he wanted to do, like parties and clubbing and dancing. 

I figured as a way to encourage him (and after asking if it was ok for me to ask him), we’ve reached the stage of our relationship where I would like to have him as my +1 to events. Though having anxiety of my own (not social, but GAD) I’ve come to realize he can only decide on going to something within about an hour before the event starts. This combined with my anxiety on an answer is honestly very stressful. I understand he needs a lot of time to decide on going or not, which involves a lot of questions - For example, if it were a birthday party, the questions would usually be, “Who’s party? How many people would be there? What time? When? Where? What is the vibe like? Will it be [this genre of music]? What are the people like?” As valid as these questions are, I usually don’t have all the answers, as I tend to just say yes to things and figure it out later. This makes the approach to social situations very different for the both of us, and for him to decide on the hour before when I would ask him weeks on advance makes it hard, but he explains that he can only know when to go on the day/within the hour because it is easier to gauge how he is feeling at this point.

I’m trying very hard to understand this as this is my first partner with social anxiety, so please be gentle in responding if you’ve read this far. I want to be a good partner to him while also acknowledging my needs in situations like these too.",1753441897.0,4,5,socialanxiety,anxiety
1m8r8tu,Dating a guy who talks about his date’s rich family,"So I’m dating a guy, he’s constantly mentioning almost all the women he dated before, kinda sounds like he is bragging about his sexual life. He often describes the women he dated were all bitches with ill intentions and bad behaviors, while he usually mentions one of the women he dated has a really powerful father who works as a top leader in some top government department, the looks on his face everytime he talked about this “father” is so proud, as if that is his father, almost like he is flying over the Himalayas, and he often mentioned this woman solving life troubles by asking her father, and that this father can solve his troubles by one single phone call, you should see the look on his face when he said that. I can tolerate a man talks about his dating history a little bit, but I don’t fancy it when he talks about his date’s powerful and rich family, sounds like he is a pu**y that wants to marry into a rich family to change his social class. And you know what? I found out most women he dated are from rich families, by rich I mean the women at least do not need to work and can live on their parents in their own country. He laughs at women who are contractors at his company, makes fun of men from crappy schools, and talks much more passionately with people studied abroad and even added their social media. And he often told me there are many female gold diggers tried to treat him like an ATM machine, such as letting him paid for dinner worthy of around $30USD. But he lets me pay for his food many times and even asked me to help him pay for his phone bills, I don’t want to argue about this kind of money with him so I pretend nothing happened, but deep down I really feel like he is more and more like a pu*sy and tight ass, I’m losing my respect to him.

1m92vwx,I feel like the words don't want to come out when I speak.,"Hello. I wanted to share with you something that has been happening to me for a long time and that has been affecting me more lately. When it comes to speaking, I feel like the words just don't want to come out. For example, I recently went to the market to buy half a kilo of eggs. When I got to the store I said, ""Hello, I have..."" and for some reason I couldn't say ""half a kilo"", I felt like the word wasn't going to come out. So I ended up saying, ""I can get a kilo of egg.""

Then I wanted to ask the lady how much a kilo was, but when I tried to say ""a kilo"", I again blanked. I got frustrated because I knew exactly what I wanted to say, but the words got stuck. Luckily the lady beat me to it and told me the price, so I took the opportunity to correct myself and order half a kilo.

This doesn't just happen to me with strangers. It happens to me too with my family. Sometimes I feel like I'm talking normally and out of nowhere the speech stops like I'm being shut down. It frustrates me a lot. A while ago I went to a psychologist, she helped me a lot. She gave me breathing and relaxation exercises and asked me to speak in front of her telling her a story. It bogged me down a bit, but I did it. He explained to me that I tend to speak very quickly and that I should speak more calmly. He gave me tongue depressor sticks to practice speaking with them in my mouth and that helped me have more control.

However, a few weeks ago I tried practicing those same exercises in front of my family and got stuck again. I felt frustrated, helpless and even hated myself for not being able to speak normally.

Come to think of it, I have always used the filler “and…” to be able to speak. It's like you need to say ""and"" for the next word to come out. Sometimes, even to start a sentence I need to say “and…” or “eeh…” because if not, I can't continue. I try to breathe and start again, but it's still difficult.

I'm trying to understand what's wrong with me and how to fix it. If any of you know what I have, what it is due to or how to solve it, please give me advice.",1753458845.0,1,1,socialanxiety,anxiety

1m88tgn,Matcha fixed my Social Anxiety (and inner critic),"Tldr:  The L-theanine/caffeine combo in Matcha turns off my social anxiety and inner critic. Now I can, for the first time in my life, actually enjoy talking with people. And people are responding positively to me.

\--------

I've struggled my whole life with social anxiety due to familial abuse and bullying from my general community.  The PTSD I have sometimes even boarders on paranoia (for understandable reason).

While I've worked on myself for decades now, self-help books and therapy, as well as developing my social and conversational skills. I still always have a hard time with just normal conversations. It is so much work.  I feel like other people can just chat circles around me, while I'm constantly expending so much energy trying to fight back the anxiousness and harsh internalized critic. Y'all know the feeling already, but it's like trying to have a conversation while someone stands over you shoulder telling you all the ways that this person is judging you and everything little thing you are saying and doing wrong, including (ironically) not listening to the person because you can't ""hear"" them over the anxiety/critic racket in your head.

It makes it impossible to enjoy conversations and impossible to truly CONNECT with others, because despite my best efforts to be ""normal"" outwardly, people can tell that I'm not fully present with them.....because, you know, the monkey on my back. It's devastatingly ironic, that my social anxiety is afraid people won't like me, but then it gets in the way of me being likeable.

And it breaks my heart, because deep down I do want to connect with people, but my traumatized brain anatomy won't let it happen.  This has been my curse for my whole life...again, decades at this point.

Enter Matcha.

For a year now I've been working at a tea shop, which is really more like a bar that serves tea (no alcohol). And a big part of our job is to talk with customers and make them feel at home while they enjoy their tea sitting at the bar. For the most part, I have managed to do an OK job of this. But I see my co-workers effortlessly connecting to our customers, and customers loving them, and it makes me feel so ""locked out"" of a whole world that I just don't get to access.  Outside looking in.

But one of the teas we serve is matcha, and so in trying to familiarize myself with our products, I've been trying different teas, including matcha, during my shifts.

Boy. I cannot. emphasize. enough. How much this tea has shifted my brain into a place I NEVER thought I'd be able to experience.  I'm not talking psycheledic or psycho-active or whatever. I'm talking purely mood alteration.   It's like the matcha takes my over-worked, over-active amygdala (anxiety), wraps it in a warm blanket and puts it down for a long over due nap.  And then it takes my inner critic/asshole and shuts it the hell up and puts it on time out.

This has freed up SO MUCH energy and mental space for me.  I now find myself freely chatting with people in a relaxed and engaged way. And I'm genuinely ENJOYNG it.  And it's EFFORTLESS.  This has basically been one of the best brain hacks I've found in my life.

On matcha, I often find myself in a flow state of chatting with people, and a small part of my brain is observing myself like I'm a new person, but really it's just the me that could never be free to just be.  I'll respond to people organically and with ease, making them laugh and lean-in to me with interest. I don't have to force myself to smile....I'm just feeling warm and fuzzy about people in general, and that makes me smile naturally........it's bizarre!  It's got me wondering....is THIS what other people without social PTSD experience normally?

As far as the physio-chemistry of it..... I looked into it, and apparently the L-theanine in the matcha is specifically good at reducing anxiety. And the caffeine in the matcha, while obviously stimulating, is actually tempered by the L-theanine.  For most people, this gives them a steady, sustained energy throughout the day (no spike or crash). And I experience this as well.  But for folks like me, with chronic social anxiety, this combination has been an absolute game changer.

I honestly wanna cry when I think about how much this has set me free. I'm free to be me now, the monkey is off my back. I get to feel like a normal person, like an acceptable part of the community now, instead of some contemptible freak.

I've also experimented with taking L-theanine capsules along with coffee and I'm able to get the same effect, so def seems to be specifically the L-theanine/caffeine combo that ""fixes"" my social trauma brain.

Hope this helps some of you out there!",1753373966.0,25,8,socialanxiety,anxiety

I just hate feeling this way, being socially inferior. It just finds a way to show and slip out.

After my psychosis, I became less automatic, and more aware, caring about the opinion of others.

It’s like I have a dual personality, the confident outgoing front that I had pre psychosis and the new shy,emotional inner core. Im getting back to my old vigor, but sometimes i get outmaneuvered socially and I cant help but feel so bad about it, so small, like an insect.

I became more focused on personality, and how my lack in that area, is painful to me. The path to rebuilding is very hard, Im trying to transcribe my pain of social humiliation into words and I don’t think I’m doing a good job of that either.

The most painful thing about this, is that you don’t know how to fight it. It’s like your subconscious takes over. Theres no 1+1 = 2.there is no clear fix

Probably the fix is, learning how to fill an empty cup when you don’t have water. Harnessing strength when all you have is weakness. We live to fight another day.

1m8ibrm,What having social anxiety feels like to me,"Having social anxiety feels like there are voices in my head every time I have a simple interaction with someone. Every time I enter a room full of people I don’t know very well, it starts. If I start talking, people are like, “Oh, she’s talking” But what’s really happening in my head is a war:

Did I talk too much? Was I being too friendly? Or too distant? Am I wasting this person’s time? Am I acting weird? Am I too loud? Why are they looking at me like that? Is there something wrong with the way I look?

Simple conversations and interactions become so exhausting they feel like hell, like I’m punching myself with thoughts I can’t escape. I’ve gone down paths where I started isolating myself because I simply couldn’t handle it. The only time I feel like myself is when I’m alone.

1m8di6y,I gave a small gift to coworkers and now I can't stop worrying I came across as creepy — does anyone else spiral like this after normal interactions?,"I deal with social anxiety and overthink a lot of my interactions, even when I know my intentions were good.

Today, I went to a skincare store to grab a hand cream for myself. The staff mentioned a 3-for-15 deal and suggested I give the extras as little gifts. I told her I work as a concierge and was heading to work right after — the only people I'd be seeing were two women I'd be taking over the shift from. She encouraged me to give the extras to them as a kind gesture.

I *like* doing small kind things like this, but I immediately started spiraling and told the staff, “I don’t want to come off as a creep — I’m not close with them.” She reassured me that it didn’t sound weird and encouraged me to go ahead with it.

For context, I usually arrive about 20 minutes early for my shift and chat with whoever’s finishing up — I do this with everyone if I can. These coworkers and I have a nice, professional relationship — not super close, but friendly.

When I saw them, I casually mentioned the hand cream deal and offered them each one, letting them pick which they liked. One said she uses the same brand. The other tried one and liked the scent. In the end, they both declined but thanked me.

Now I can’t stop overthinking it — what if I came across as creepy? What if they felt uncomfortable? My brain is stuck on this loop, even though nothing bad happened.

1m8merj,"Social anxiety from overthinking my looks & how I come across — it’s exhausting. I’ve added a quick TL;DR, would love your thoughts 🙏 (men & women welcome)","Tl,dr: 20M from India dealing with social anxiety that’s rooted in constant overthinking — about my appearance, how I’m perceived, and fear of being judged, especially in social or dating situations. It’s mentally exhausting and holding me back from the kind of life I know I could live.
I’d really appreciate insight from anyone — men or women — on how you’ve dealt with this or see it. Your perspective could genuinely help.

Post begins : 
Hey everyone,
I’m a 20-year-old student from South Asia (India), and I’ve been struggling a lot with social anxiety — especially tied to how I look and how I’m perceived by others.

I don’t have any major appearance issues, but I tend to fixate on small things — like feeling my cheeks look a bit fuller — and that snowballs into overthinking everything. Some days I feel okay, and other days even seeing myself in the mirror or photos makes me uncomfortable. It’s not just about looks, though — it’s about how I believe people are viewing me.

The deeper issue is the constant fear of judgment.
I hesitate to talk to people — especially girls — because I worry I’ll be made fun of or come across the wrong way. It’s like my brain is always running simulations of how people might react, even before anything happens. That anxiety makes me pull away from chances to connect socially.

I end up overanalyzing everything — my posture, tone, expressions, body language — and it keeps me trapped in my own head. I want to be relaxed and natural, but my mind doesn’t let me.

💬 To anyone reading this — men or women — I’d really appreciate your thoughts.
Have you felt this way before? How did you deal with it?
How do you stop caring so much about what others might think and start being more present and confident in social moments?

I know this mindset is holding me back from fully experiencing life, and I genuinely want to grow out of it.

1m7sef1,Accidentally turned down job opportunity,"Today I received a call from a grocery store (large corporation) asking me if I am interested in a deli position.

I applied online for other positions at that store (not the deli) about a month ago so receiving a call now was completely unexpected. I'm also terrified of phone calls so this made the call even worse.

I panicked and asked if they were also hiring for the grocery clerk role I originally applied online for. They said that they were only conducting interviews for the Deli position. So I said I wasn't interested because again I didn't expect to get a call after so long, and since I didn't apply for the deli online, I didnt really know what the job involved. I also wanted to get off the phone as quick as possible.

In hindsight I should have asked more about the deli clerk role before making my decision. Maybe I would have said yes, and I would have an opportunity because I've been looking for a job for months now.

I'm thinking of calling them again next morning just to explain that I am actually interested in working at the deli at their store. Should I?

1m8m83b,Been in therapy for years & im feeling worse lately,"Ive been with my current therapist since December (after several years of inconsistent therapists/switching ect).
Idk if we are doing cbt or just talk therapy but it hasnt helped & ive been feeling worse/more depressed/anxious. Ive stuck with her bc i feel connected w her & i was tired of switching trying to find the right fit.

I dont know what i need. I dont know if medication is the answer to my social discomfort. Idk if EMDR is the answer, maybe I have autism or adhd, theres so many different things but I feel more & more hopeless.

I developed ocd in adolescence then social anxiety followed soon after. I havent been the same since.

I feel social anxiety with my mom my only friend, its as if i dont feel comfortable. I never feel like hanging out with anyone it all feels like a chore, like work. I only feel comfortable with my boyfriend but recently I’ve been blanking out with him too.

Ive been stuttering more, blanking out, having depersonalization, being awkward. 
I continue to push myself & go out, order at restaurants, talk to cashiers, i still keep doing it it all feels like exposure but its been feeling harder. 
Of course the loneliness is making me depressed.

First, I have to look up the place on google maps and look at the entrance and possibly the interior so I know what to expect and how to follow through ig? 

With Chiptole you have to talk to the workers and it’s fast paced so you need to know what you want, but I’m not familiar with the menu at all. Which is why I can ONLY order online and pickup, but even that makes me nervous which is why I haven’t had Chiptole in literal 5 years. 

Subway however I’ve gotten used to because I always went with a friend and my anxiety always goes away when I’m with someone, hence my ability to understand the menu and go by myself (tho I mostly order online). Before I was a regular I had to look up on YouTube and TikTok how to order from subway because the first time I walked in I was so confused and ended up embarrassing myself AND getting smth I didn’t even want 😭.

I suckkkkk at reading social cues and actually anything regarding .. ew social skills lol. Why is it sooo fucking harrdd to figure out what to say when and in a way that stands the least chance of being misunderstood. And there is this thing where you actually have to understand what the other person is trying to sayyy in order to give them a proper answer, because surpriseee that's how normal healthy human being's convos work, because ohhhh! They can't read minds (thank gawd). And in your answer you sometimes even have to cleverly include your own statement/wants/thoughts that are important because out of some reason, being direct is considered rude, and on top of that, pretty fucking hard actually sometimes. 

Like usgshshshhs and you can't just askkkk!🥲  (with me that'd be every other sentence of the convo). because you dont want to be an annoying crazy person with whom the other one suddenly doesnt wanna talk with anymoreee after a lot of questions and slow processing.. but you actually needed to have that talk bc its about smth important, and if you wait to hit them up later it just gets even more awkward.


And its a wholeeee different mind apocalypse if the person doesnt voice what they want/mean in a clear direct wayyyy.. Then its just this weird.. trying to solve a puzzle and you dont know what it is, and everybody knows how, except you or smth. (Sorry shitty metaphor) 

I'm literally guessingggg half of the time what they want cause I study people's personalities and try to sort how they would react to what in what setting, context, circumstances etc. And its this weird guessing game, while having to act nonchalant and as if you know what you are doing. I fucking don't, I feel like Im floating helplessly and its soooo exhausting because.. ha haaaa!

1m806tz,Maybe it's only my parents?,"Heya everyone, over the past couple of months I've been trying to break through my social anxiety, I started taking Sertraline which I think has yet to start working, but I've been trying to meet up with more people and find jobs and volunteer at places, overall just trying to get exposure and get over it, I am so done with being alone and feeling disappointed in myself.

However, I started to think about the causes of my social anxiety, maybe it is genes, very possible in fact because I've always been called the shy kid at school from ever since I remember. But I'm starting to think that my parents may have contributed to my illness.

First of all, my parents argued, A LOT, it got to the point that I never really enjoyed weekends away from school because I had to listen to their frequent fights, sometimes having to step in and try to stop them, I have a younger sister so as a brother I felt the need to, just to get yelled back at and sworn at. Yeah, probably not good for my development. I'm 20 now, and sometimes I think back to all of it. My parents have since separated due to affairs on my father's side.

Second of all, maybe more important than the previous, my parents ALWAYS judge people around them, their friends, random people on street, whatever. And y'know as a kid you see that and figure that others will look at you the same? You know what I mean.

Third, I feel like I never got emotional support from my parents, I grew up fat into my late teens, we're talking borderline obese and everyone told me I just had thick bones or whatever excuse they could come up with. I also never left my house and played on my console on free days from school. No pushing from my parents to meet new friends, nothing.

It was only a couple of years ago I took my life into my own hands and lost nearly 30kg of weight. I still contribute this ALL to myself, I received no support. And when I did lose the weight, I barely got any comments, I literally felt the same even though the scale went down.

Let me know if these points apply to you.

TL:DR Emotional neglect as a kid sucks, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were one of the main causes of social anxiety, please raise your kids to be good people and help them be sociable, guys.",1753350821.0,4,2,socialanxiety,anxiety

1m7qmpq,Who paid me to think,"I over analyze. I think. …

A buddy of mine (25M) is outgoing. Always social. Always the life of the party. 

Me (25F)? I’m a mix. I get along with everyone, but only for the first few hang outs. Then I have nothing to say. I feel like either I’m boring or anxious thoughts get in the way of me continuing the conversation. 

I’m friendly. And can be seen as quiet, or standoffish. 

Anyways, this buddy is supporting me, and said he wants me to be myself, to be me. But I can’t. I feel like he’s going to leave me. 

And now another guy friend (25F) who is on the surface super bubbly with tons of friends told me he’s tired, and just wants to sleep. But I don’t want to admit I’m like this too because then he may leave me.

I began this as thinking I have over thinking issues. Now I know it’s a fear that people will leave me. I think.

I also have really bad anxiety and being alone I just never went out. My entire childhood was spend inside. I can't go to stores alone or anywhere really.

I turned 18 last week, I also started talking to my cousin again and we made plans to go rock climbing. I would like to add the reason we started talking was because I went to a family gathering for the first time in at least 7 years, I hadn't gone before then since I was too anxious even around my own family. Just to give you a picture of the depths of my anxiety.

I feel very nervous, we're going Friday and I feel awkward A. because I don't know what to talk about and I genuinely haven't talked to anyone in months (it's the summer and I'm unemployed and ofc friendless so no where I feel I can go) and B.

I have a wonderful wife and two children that bring me so much happiness, but I feel like I will never be content within myself.

I cannot make any new friendships and shut down in group situations due to the uncontrollable physical response of my anxiety, which includes excessive blushing, accelerated heart rate and extreme sweating. This prevents me from conversing properly as I am constantly aware of these symptoms and worrying about how I’m being perceived.

I have tried exposure therapy many times socially and at work but made zero improvement. My career prospects are non existent because of it and I feel like a complete failure to my family.

I have also tried several supplements/nootropics/herbal meds, including
ashwaghanda, magnesium, kava, kanna, kratom, l-theanine and passionflower with no success in easing symptoms.

1m7in85,"What should I do here, and is anyone else in a similar position?","



I’ve made real progress socially  (have high functioning autism) — I’m more present, more aware, and more comfortable being myself. But even when I’m not overthinking, I still don’t get the outcomes I want. I don’t come off as confident or respectable, and it’s frustrating because I’m genuinely trying. I still struggle w dating, get patronized/infantilized, seen as innocent, seem passive, and the butt of jokes.

When I push to improve further, it backfires. I spiral, overanalyze everything for days, and start second-guessing myself so much that it feels fake. I lose the flow I do have. People say I look disingenuous when I try too hard to change these things. I get severe social anxiety also.

Socializing brings me dread now and I spiral after every event or occasion now. After every group activity or date I spend hours questioning my existence lowkey. 

If I didn’t have sexual desire, I’d honestly rather just do things I enjoy alone and not socialize. 

What makes it harder is that my voice, cadence, and processing speed aren’t things I can just change. They’re part of how I’m wired. A lot of social advice assumes you can just “talk faster” or “be more charming,” but I don’t work like that.

Therapy also is mostly Bs. Therapy emphasizes things I’ve heard since childhood and coping w or ignoring a situation rather than changing it. Therapy as it is today is more designed usually for lower functioning cases and young children (it reinforces people pleasing as well).

It feels like I’ve hit a ceiling. I’m not trying to be the most charismatic person — I’d be happy just being seen as socially competent. But I’m stuck in this space where effort starts making things worse, not better. Anyone else feel this?",1753298828.0,1,2,socialanxiety,anxiety
1m71uxz,Social anxiety's exhausting mix of emotions.,"Social anxiety is such a weird, exhausting mix of emotions. 😩 one part of you wants to be around people... to connect, laugh, and feel part of something. but the other part? it’s screaming, “what if you say something awkward? what if they’re judging you? what if you don’t belong?” and suddenly, being around people feels like running a mental marathon. 

it’s this constant push-and-pull. you crave connection, but the second you’re in a social situation, the overthinking kicks in. “was that joke too much? should i have said that? are they just being polite?” it’s like you’re in the room, but your brain is three steps ahead, analyzing everything. 

and let’s not forget how physically draining it is. your heart races, your palms get sweaty, and you feel like you’re hyper-aware of every move you make. 😳 meanwhile, everyone else seems so calm and effortless. it’s hard not to wonder, “why can’t i just be like that?”

if you struggle with this, let me remind you: you’re not alone, and you’re not broken. social anxiety doesn’t mean you’re bad at connecting, in fact, it often means you care so deeply about people and making them feel comfortable. that’s a beautiful thing. 

when it gets overwhelming, try to remind yourself: people aren’t watching you as closely as your anxiety makes you think. most of the time, they’re too focused on their own lives to pick apart your every word or action. and even if you do have a slightly awkward moment? that’s human. it’s okay. 

you don’t have to be “perfect” to be worthy of connection. the people who matter will love you for your quirks, your kindness, and the way you show up, even when it’s hard. and on the days when socializing feels too much, it’s okay to take a step back and recharge.

1m6ys91,What helped me with severe social anxiety,"I see so many posts here every day asking what helps. I find myself writing the same things. I thought I'd post about what helped me. Therapy is the obvious thing, but I didn't have access to therapy, so I read a lot of self-help books. It took a long time. But when I think about why it took so long, the main reason is I didn't really believe that anything would actually work. I thought it might work for other people, but that I was different, and not fixable. That was wrong, and the sooner you believe that you CAN improve the faster you will.

Other things I did:

* worked on my self-esteem by writing out a HUGE list (pages) of everything I hated about myself or thought anyone else would not like me for - everything from appearance, personality, habits, etc.  Then for each one, right next to it I wrote a neutral statement. Not a positive statement because in the beginning your brain won't believe you - just neutral.  Example: ""frizzy hair"" -> hair that doesn't always stay where I put it. 
* learned about common mind traps in social anxiety and how to get out of them. For example, people with SA minimize their successes and fixate on their failures, or perceived failures. So one interaction that was negative, or perceived negative, could ruin a whole day and cause days or weeks of worrying about it, when all the other interactions of the day that DID go well went unnoticed. There are a ton of those mind traps and learning about those helped.
* setting goals and breaking them down into much smaller steps.  Also called gradual exposure and creating a fear hierarchy.
* listening and responding to a person rather than listening to anxiety and responding in the quickest way possible to get everything over with and take up the least amount of their time.
* gradually, learning to accept myself and take a broader perspective about anxiety. Anxiety is not the enemy, fighting it is exhausting.  This is called ""letting go of the rope"". Stopping the endless tug of war between me and anxiety. 

Books that helped me do all of this, just a sample because there were many: In the beginning CBT-based books: Self-Esteem by McKay and Fanning and Overcoming Shyness by Jonathan Creek. There are now many others.

Later on - Quiet by Susan Cain - this is more about Introversion than SAD but it helped me see the difference and helped me shift my thinking toward self acceptance. 

Then, getting more into true acceptance and a broader perspective than just ""not feeling anxious"": The Happiness Trap - not about SAD but gave me the basis for acceptance. More recently 2 books that are about SAD and take a broader view are More than Shyness (Norm Wilson) and Redface (Russell Norris).

I hope that helps someone.

1m6yrvr,How do I stand up for myself?,"So basically, today at work, it was very busy and I dropped some plastic cups that was supposed to be for the bar and my supervisor said that “I was being r-word and should be like the other busboys” and that “if I don’t stop being clumsy, I’m going to tell the manager that your too special to work here so we could let you go”. That really hurt and I struggle to work the rest of the day without bursting out crying in front of everyone. It was a really stressful day and that made my social anxiety even worse.

1m6o3i5,Avoiding meetings because of anxiety… I need advice.,"
Honestly, I’ve never felt comfortable in meetings — especially in new jobs or with people I don’t know well. One time, I was in a team meeting and everyone was talking so confidently, while my heart was beating like a drum at a wedding. I tried to smile to look normal, but inside I just wanted to disappear.

Then it was my turn to speak, and without realizing, I said something that made absolutely no sense — like a broken robot. A colleague looked at me and said, “Could you repeat that?” and I just burst out laughing nervously. Everyone started laughing with me… and somehow the moment passed. But deep down, I felt so small, like a tiny dot on a screen.

Since that day, I started avoiding meetings with too many people. I’d come up with excuses not to join. But honestly, I’m tired. I’ve started looking for real solutions — books, podcasts, breathing techniques… anything that can help with social anxiety, especially in professional settings.

If anyone here has gone through something similar and found a way to deal with it, I’d honestly appreciate any advice or tips. 🙏

And if I ever find something that really helps me, I promise I’ll come back and share it with you too.

1m6kd3x,My mood depends on how I am perceived by others. And this has ruined my mental health over the last year.,"Over the past year, I’ve found that my mood often depends on how I’m perceived by others, especially my friends. I feel like I constantly have to “perform” in social situations—be the funny, interesting guy that people enjoy being around. If I come across as awkward or off, it sticks with me for days. I’ll replay it in my head and feel ashamed until the next time I see someone and feel like I’ve “redeemed” myself by being good company again.

Meeting new people is always difficult for me. I struggle to come out of my shell, but once I feel comfortable, I can be myself. The same thing happens with old friends I haven’t seen in a while—I start overthinking what to say, how to act, or whether they’ve changed and won’t enjoy my company like they used to. This has been especially hard over the last year since I started university. My close group of school friends, who I used to see every day, are now scattered, and we only meet up during holidays.

This shift has made me feel really low at times. I often think about how easy and natural everything used to feel with them, and I don’t understand why I can’t just act the same now. It’s made me start to isolate myself, even though I miss them. For example, going to the pub with them used to be the highlight of my week—now I dread it. I’m scared I’ll come across as awkward or different, and that they won’t want to spend time with me like they used to. I get so stuck on trying to be “good company” that I can’t just enjoy the moment.

I worry a lot about losing touch with them, and honestly, I feel like that’s already starting to happen—and that it’ll be my fault. I also find it really hard to keep in touch over the phone. I’m not sure why, but I think it’s linked to social anxiety. I avoid it even though I know it would help.

This past year has been the most depressed I’ve ever felt. It’s like my social anxiety has completely taken over my thoughts. I constantly worry about how I come across. Before, I never thought twice about it, but now it’s all I think about. It got so bad that even if someone looked at me in a pub, club or anywhere busy for that matter, I’d start panicking, convinced they were talking badly about me—even though I’ve never done anything to deserve that. It got so bad I became paranoid and would sometimes even try to listen in to friends or even strangers conversations to check if they’re talking about me instead of being present in the moment. This constantly being on my mind caused me to believe these fake thoughts and I still believe them sometimes to this day and feel I need 100% confirmation that it’s not true to get over it.

All of this has turned what’s supposed to be one of the best, most social times of my life into something filled with fear, isolation, and negative self-talk. I know something needs to change, because I can’t keep living like this. I just want to go back to how I was before, when I could enjoy being around people without all this overthinking.

I don’t understand exactly why this started, but think it could be due to several factors. I’d really like to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar and how they got through it. Opening up is really hard for me, even with close friends—I struggle to fully trust people. I haven’t told my parents how I’ve been feeling either, because they already worry about me and I don’t want to make that worse.

The truth is, I’ve had some really low moments this past year. I just want to feel like myself again and go back to how things were—when I could enjoy time with people without overthinking everything.

If you’ve felt like this before, I’d really appreciate hearing how you got through it. I know something needs to change, but I’m not sure where to start.",1753205313.0,23,2,socialanxiety,anxiety

I never do but I did I wanted him to watch me like idk if I’m thinking I’m in a wattpad story but I wanted him to like me or even just stare at me (not creepily but like he liked me) or some shit but he only glanced a few times. (I knew this isn’t related to the girl but I had to mention that for the story) And the year 7 girl I think is a loner like me (I don’t rlly know if I have friends bc I don’t message people or hang out after school or rlly at school. I only say hi to some people a few times at school) I wanted to maybe talk to her and start small talk so I’m not as lonely and she isn’t but when she starting talking,I didn’t really care what she was saying.

One of my “only saying hi at school” friend said nice moves or something to me and that made me really happy and I think the guy looked at me when she said that.

Anyway about the year 7 girl I small talked with, I think I wanna be friends but idk. Because it’s weird she’s 3 years behind me and I sometimes sit near her in the library.

so over the past year i have tried several antidepressants and maxed them out without responding to them. have tried mirtazapine, lexapro which helped but only for depression, and venlafaxine (effexor) which again helped but only for depression side. i have taken every ad for at least 4 months and maxed them out but just nothing seems to work for my social anxiety. i also think that i‘m a very bad metabolizer because i would have to take a very high dose of everything just to have the slidest effect. 
also i‘m trying pregabalin, currently 2x200mg but it also has no effect at all for me like no effect no sideeffect just nothing. 
i‘m considering to taper effexor and pregabalin and try moclobemid for my social anxiety? has anyone had success? as much as i know it is considered weak but seemes to work for some people who didn‘t respond to ssri/snri‘s 
i‘m also doing cbt but i just need something to help me.

1m6vger,It sucks to feel nervous and not know what to do in a conversation — I want to change that,"I recently realized that I really need to improve my communication skills. I get very nervous when I have to talk to people — I get flustered, say things without thinking, or lose my train of thought and end up confused in the middle of a conversation.

For a long time, I thought my communication was “okay,” but now I see I’ve always been in my comfort zone: my childhood friends. I have one friend group in real life and two online, but I made all three groups when I was a kid — I don’t even remember how I managed to become friends with them. It just happened naturally, I guess.

I’ve tried a few times to make new friends online, but I failed because I just can’t keep up with talking daily. Keeping thoughts like “I want to be friends with this person” in my mind just makes it feel forced and awkward — it actually makes it harder. In real life, I’ve always stuck with my same small group. Some people left and new ones joined, but I never went out of my way to find new people to talk to.

About two years ago, something happened that made me lose my confidence in speaking to people. I became more withdrawn and scared of talking. I think I’ve recovered a lot since then, but I still feel the fear. For example, I was never able to present school projects because I was too shy. But recently, for the first time ever, I actually did it twice! It wasn’t perfect, but it felt good to face that fear after so many years of running away.

Still, I notice that I can only talk to strangers on the street if I’m with a friend. Alone, I freeze. I’ve tried to push myself, but it’s really hard. For example, I tried going on Omegle to talk to random people — but the first person that appeared made me so nervous that my heart raced and my body felt hot, so I left immediately and never went back.I also tried VRChat because I thought it might be easier, but that didn’t work either. One time, I was in a map and saw three people standing a bit apart — I walked over to them to try to start a conversation, but for some reason I got so nervous that I couldn’t say anything. I left without saying a word, even though I really wanted to talk. Other times I tried speaking to groups, but it felt like no one could hear me. They seemed like nice people, but I had no idea how to get closer to them — even though I wanted to talk, I could only stand there listening.

I really don’t like this. I wish I could make more friends and not get so nervous in these situations. Even simple things become awkward: today I went to the doctor and he reached out his hand to take a paper from me, but I thought he was greeting me — so I shook his hand and then handed over the paper. It was funny, but it shows how my insecurity makes me act without thinking.

Sometimes I see people on the street who look attractive or interesting, and I wish I could just say something, but I freeze. I keep thinking, “What should I say?” “What if they ignore me?” “What if I don’t know what to say next?” Recently, I saw someone really beautiful who looked like an old crush I hadn’t seen in years — but I couldn’t say anything. I felt pathetic about that.

With my friends, I talk a lot — even when I don’t know what to say, I still feel free to be myself. But with strangers, it’s like I forget how to talk at all.

Is the only way to get better at this really just to practice? To push myself to talk to more people? It’s so hard and honestly so scary for me. I want to be able to strike up conversations, make new friends, or just say something silly to strangers when I feel like it.

1m6sh2j,Dealing with a costume party where I am uncomfortable with what I’m supposed to wear,"To preface: there’s no intentional malice on any party. Everything is intended to be fun and a lighthearted game. I don’t want anyone to assume my friends are doing anything wrong. I’d just like advice on what *I* should do. 

I’ve been invited to a costume party where we’re all given a character and said character has a clothing/costume list. 

I am a cis woman but I’ve always dressed rather masculinely. I have for as long as I can remember. It’s just who I am and what I am comfortable wearing. I often dress modesty and casually. Lots of just jeans and shirts and hoodies. 

Now the character I was assigned is closer to I’d say Dolly Parton in appearance. Nothing wrong with Dolly Parton she’s great. But her style of dress/style of dress of my character is soooo far away from how I normally appear it’s giving me a deep anxiety I cannot figure out. (Think big hair, blouse revealing busty top, fake nails, extreme makeup, leopard print leggings)

The socially acceptable thing to do would be to buck up, grab a costume, accept it’s all going to be very silly and just roll with it. But I’ve been utterly dragging my feet on the whole thing. (Not to mention I’d rather not spend money on items like fake nails, wigs, and clothing I will never wear again so a bit of financial anxiety too). I’m afraid someone will take a photo of me. I’m afraid I’ll be paid attention to in that way of “omg [me] is wearing x y or z clothes!”. Again I don’t anticipate anyone will be mean it will all be in good fun but being paid attention to in that way makes me idk uncomfortable? For example when I wore makeup in high school for the very first time and everyone was making comments on it I just stopped wearing makeup after that. 

Sort of like if you’re being a recluse in your room and you come out of your room and your parents are like “oh wow look who’s out of their room”.( I’m not quite sure how to explain the feeling)

I don’t know if I should talk to the host about it. Or just say something came up and not attend. The latter being a bit of a bummer because I like my friends and want to be around them. ",1753223964.0,3,2,socialanxiety,anxiety

1m6srv8,Is this social anxiety?,"We tried to drop my 15 year old daughter at a 10 day college enrichment program located about 300 miles from home. She had an utter meltdown - vomiting, crying, just complete panic about being in a program with kids she didn’t know and away from her family. This is the second time this has happened; the last time was at a soccer camp in Florida two years ago. What has us - and her - stymied is that she is not particularly anxious in everyday social situations. While admittedly more of an introvert, she has plenty of friends, is able to interact with strangers, is fine when she meets new kids, has no issues speaking in class or doing presentations. Her therapist seems a bit stymied - what are we actually dealing with? Is it PTSD from the first meltdown last year? True social anxiety? A phobia?

1m6o62b,Do I have social anxiety?,"Like the title says, I’m not really sure if I have social anxiety or not. Can’t get a diagnosis or go to a therapist cus I’m a minor whose parents believe in the good old “it’s all in your head! No one’s looking at you! Just don’t think about it.” Thus I’m too scared to tell them about a possibility of me having it cus they might laugh or react negatively in other ways and I feel horrible about myself already so I don’t really need that. 

It only really shows when I’m in school, alone or away from my parents. When that happens, I usually sweat, my mind goes blank, I feel like everyone’s staring at me and I kind of wanna scratch off my skin, cry or bury myself under the ground (that last one only happens when it’s REALLYYYY severe) I also sometimes start crying when someone laughs and that makes it worse cus I feel like a useless crybaby + they laugh even more when I start crying than before. 

I don’t know if it really is all in my head. I feel like I do have social anxiety but not sure it counts because those stuff I stated only happen when it’s REALLY REALLY bad. Usually, daily when in school or when someone visits my family and me, I just sweat a lot and can’t utter a word for the life of me, feel horrible about myself for being so useless but that’s about it.

I've been suffering from social anxiety really bad a whole year. I've demolished my whole circle of so-called support (they all appeared to be narcissists), barely talk to my parents. But I visit a therapist every week. I have barely spoken to anyone in months - just decompressing and hoping that it's going to get better one day. Recently I went to a new mobile provider to make a switch from my old one. Was anxious, but managed to smile and even have a nice chat (naive, as I thought) with an assistant. Was very proud of myself until he texted my current number, which he took from the record without asking for my consent. He named himself and asked politely if he informed me that my number transfer was scheduled to the X date. I thanked him. Next day, he continued texting me, like we haven't ended the professional conversation (can I even call it that way?), asking what do I do for work. Guys, I know I'm maybe too sensitive, but I'm terrified, and I can't seem to stop my anxiety. It goes like this: if he has my number, it means he can have my address, too, from the same record. If I report him to the company, it can cause anger and revenge. If I don't report him, I am not safe either. The remaining acquaintance of mine (yes, I had to speak briefly to someone about this) thinks it's cute what he did, and that I'm just spiralling, and that there's no danger at all.

1m6s0vc,Does anyone else get anxious about shaking hands because of sweat?,"I’ve had palmar hyperhidrosis for years, and one of the hacks I used to rely on was wearing those super thin plastic gloves or a cotton glove — just to write on paper or for gaming without soaking everything.

The problem is, it gets gross fast. The sweat would pool at the fingertips, the glove would fog up, and my hand would stick to the plastic. It never felt good — just a “less bad” option.

I also remember dreading networking events or trade shows where I’d have to shake hands. I always wished I had something discreet that would let me feel more normal in those moments.

So here’s my question: Have you ever worn gloves to deal with sweat in daily situations — like writing, gaming, driving, using tools, etc.? Would you wear something if it actually helped?

I’m messing around with some prototypes right now to see what’s possible (lightweight, breathable, absorbent — not bulky or obvious), and I’d really appreciate any feedback or even skepticism.

It’s painful to see where others my age end up in life, not even from an envious or bitter perspective. Simply, I see what I could have had. If only my brain had not been wired to see any social interaction as a threat, fearing rude comments or insensitive remarks. If only I had a core self esteem inside me. 

Honestly, I shouldn’t be too shocked. My brother, he used to struggle a lot with me. He grew up to became quite a narcissist, we both took a lot of damage in our formative years. Maybe the elementary days were what scarred me. Or rather, solidified my issues. 

I can see it now, I’ll be old and with grey hairs; still just as anxious as my teenage days. No matter how much insight, wisdom, or grit I develop. I’ll always cower from socialization. And that’s assuming I make it to old age.

There is a part of me that just wants to have that connection with someone or a group of people, but the thing is most of the time the reason why I want to be in a group is because I’m scared of people judging me for being alone.

1m671mz,It’s almost impossible to imagine being able to actually talk about myself.,"I literally have no memory of ever excitedly telling someone about something I was interested in. I barely have any childhood memories actually but that’s a whole other thing. Even hearing other people ask someone what music they listen to or what shows they watch makes me start to sweat from anxiety even if I’m not in the conversation. 

It’s just so isolating to never be able to share anything with anyone. I can’t vent to anyone about my feelings but I wish I could at least mention something I liked or wanted to do but my brain just doesn’t let me. Not being able to talk about your interests completely isolates you from making new friends too. What are you supposed to talk about? People say I’m a great listener but that’s only because I can’t fathom being able to say anything to someone that isn’t a tailored, acceptable response. 

It doesn’t help that everyone in my life either doesn’t care about what I have to say or would think the things I like are weird. I don’t know if anyone can relate but I am constantly talked over and it genuinely makes me painfully angry for a split second whenever it happens. It also reinforces the idea that nobody actually cares what you have to say.

Idk I was trying to think of something to cap this off but it’s just a rant about hiding every aspect of my personality and interests since age 5

1m5op7r,"25M struggling with SA, no motivation, isolated for a year, life finished after uni","Hi y'all

This will probably be pretty chaotic, just wanted to share some of my experiences. I'll try to give a couple of short points first (I know that it could hide some deeper issues but I don't want to create a whole book here).

First of all I've been going to the therapist every 2 weeks for past 4 months, I have severe social anxiety, I'm pretty much isolated at home for the past year (since I graduated and got my Master's in CS). I had helicopter parenting (only dad but still) and I've never tried to experience stuff outside on my own. I am externally motivated (based on one dr. k video) and I've realized recently that I haven't done pretty much anything out of my own ""internal wants"".

So, the first point is about motivation and work. From watching videos and talking to my therapist I get the sense that ""of course I'm not doing XYZ"" because I don't have the drive or don't feel like it (be it hobby or work). The problem is that my current approach is forcing myself into doing some routine hobby stuff (like flashcards for Spanish for example) because otherwise I would not have done ANYTHING. What's confusing is that some say of course you don't progress or feel joy in ""hobbies"" because you don't feel real motivation to do it and instead you rely on willpower. On the other hand in many videos there's this concept that instead of thinking you have to start DOING anything at all, so I thought that doing these forces things is kinda good? Anyway I don't have any internal hobby drives in a nutshell.

What's more is that my therapist said that my vision for work is kinda sad, meaning that I can do kinda anything because nothing is interesting and I just want to ""survive"" the shift then go to home to maybe focus on my hobbies and the stuff that I really want. We've went through many jobs and I literally found a problem with everyone of them which makes it feel like pure suffering - in short meaning that I feel hopeless about employment and working.

I can say that up until last year I was actually kinda fine because since early days (like last years of elementary school let's say) I knew my path. I wanted to go to uni and get degree in probably CS and that diploma would be my trophy for doing it. Many people online on various mental health subreddits share their struggles through school, dropping out etc. I actually loved it! I was so used to the system, only interacting with peers, having clear grades for homework/tests that I felt comfortable in this environment because it felt like it was clear what I had to do + it was the only thing I've known. The vision of really unknown interactions like work, shopping, random small-talks kinda invokes the social anxiety spike.

One more random thing is that I feel I'm hypersensitive and I feel everything stronger (even the positives!). Watching the final of a stressful sport match of my team/player AND going to a hairdresser invokes similar responses - sweating so much I have to change clothes, increased pulse, fidgeting etc.

Last thing I want to say is that I wonder if there are cases of truly incurable people. People always try hard to prevent you from committing suicide if it gets that bad, but it seems like for some there are no solutions. Like all the talks with therapist and videos of Dr. K point to kinda similar direction of ""you have to face the bad to feel good later"". For me I feel unable to face anything and I don't think I'm strong enough to force myself out there and I think that if I'll have to die because of hunger or not affording rent - so be it. On the one hand noone can do it for me but on the other I can't do it for myself because well, months pass and I'm still at the same spot.

Hope you have a wonderful day and lives <3",1753117814.0,10,3,socialanxiety,anxiety

1m5m53o,Social anxiety at peak (introvert pro max ultra+),"Like I can’t even talk to classmates properly because of the fear of being judged. Today I was just at a petrol pump and I was literally getting stressed over small things like —
what am I doing? should I move my scooter? should I pay first? should I stand like this? should I talk like that?
Everything just felt wrong and I was overthinking every second.

When I go shopping, I’m like — am I allowed to touch this? should I even be looking here? how should I stand? how should my voice sound? what mood should I show?

And don’t even get me started on salons... haircut is like my worst nightmare 💈💀
When I was small people used to laugh at me while I got a haircut — just for fun, for their entertainment. That trauma is still stuck. I just sit there now and want it to be over.

And it’s not like I’m dumb. I know I’m smart. But I can’t communicate properly. I can’t speak what I’m thinking. 😤
So to reduce anxiety, I tried buying things — expensive-looking watch, good phone — thought maybe it’ll make me feel confident. But no. Now I know: money ≠ confidence.

Also I’m not short or anything — I’m 6'4"" at 16 years old. And yeah, I’m a bit fat (~120kg). But people say “you don’t look that heavy,” and when they hear my weight, they’re shocked. That just makes me feel worse.

And I hate my freaking voice. I sound terrible to myself. I stammer a bit, or mess up words, totla types, and then I just feel like shutting up.
And maybe one reason I can’t communicate well is because I’m too smart for people to understand me — and I also can’t explain properly — so it just looks like I’m dumb pro max ultra edition.

And I think all of this started from when I was small. Like class 2 to 5. I was always that polite good boy, teachers’ pet. I was taught good manners, to not hurt anyone, not hit anyone, not say bad things.
And because of that, everyone targeted me.
I got bullied daily — in the van, in school — even got beaten up. I used to complain to their parents, but I never stood up for myself. I didn’t know how.

Then after COVID, I came back and started standing up to people — but it was too late. I was alone. They had their groups, their gangs. They started making mazaak of me. Again.

And maybe all this is the reason I started falling in studies too.

1m62w1z,Tried something new for my social anxiety.,"I was on social media when I saw something called L-Theanine pop up on my feed. I looked into it and figured I might as well give it a try. After taking it for a few weeks, I’ve noticed a positive difference, I’m not as shaky, I was able to talk on the phone without getting nervous, and I’ve felt more comfortable being in public. If you’ve never heard of it, I definitely recommend it 100%. It’s not a drug it’s a natural amino acid found in green tea leaves as well as some mushrooms. Here is a brief summary of what it is below 👇

L-theanine is a naturally occurring amino acid primarily found in green tea and some mushrooms. It’s known for its calming effects and is often used as a supplement to reduce stress and improve focus without causing drowsiness.

Key Benefits:

	•	Promotes relaxation: Increases alpha brain waves, which are linked to a relaxed yet alert mental state.

	•	Reduces anxiety and stress: Often used by people with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, or during high-stress situations.

	•	Improves focus and attention: Especially when taken with caffeine, it can enhance concentration and mental clarity.

	•	Supports better sleep: May help with falling asleep more easily and improving sleep quality—without being a sedative.",1753152878.0,1,1,socialanxiety,anxiety
1m5n75n,25 female with social anxiety asking for help,"Hi, I used to be a friendly and confident girl until I was 16 years old. At that time, I started high school, and every student in my class was very good and came from better families than mine. From that point on, I became more introverted.

However, I am afraid of meeting people, especially when they are around while I am working.

1m5pfxd,Social Anxiety at Internship,"Hi! This is a long one, bear with me. I've been doing this internship at an on-campus lab for the past few weeks, and I didn't talk to anyone other than my (two) teammates, who are super-friendly and nice to me, even though I'm a complete beginner (and honestly, I don't even know how I got selected). But apart from that, I haven't really talked to anyone. So, coming to what actually happened- There's this project that's really popular(not mine), and a lot of people are members of that project, whom I haven't talked to. And, that was fine, until today- I met this girl, who was also a fellow first year (incoming junior), and we were among the only 2 first-years chosen for this thing, the rest are all seniors. Within one day of being here, she talked to EVERYONE (something I'd been struggling to do for WEEKS) and managed to join their project. And then, since I was the first person she talked to, ig she felt obligated to or smth, but she invited me for lunch with the intimidating seniors, and I went. But I'd not talked to any of them prior to this, and even though once we were at the cafeteria I introduced myself to a few of them, we didn't talk much beyond that, and it was so awkward. It was especially hard because I couldn't even go on my phone as it was not on me, and I just pretended to zone out, but I was hyper aware of everything that was going on around me. I even tried to smile at them and laugh at their jokes, and it didn't work. I was slouching and trying to look away and every pore in my body was itching to get away, and I almost cried right there. It was like I wasn't even there.   
And that just got me thinking of how everything has always been like this, and will ALWAYS be like this. First it was school, then it was any extracurricular I ever took up before I eventually dropped it, and now it's uni, and this is probably what it'll be like at a job, and all the events I'll have to attend.

“Everyone you meet will have a different perception of you” That’s because everyone is different and perceives things differently so why even cater to them or worry. With social anxiety nothing you do will ever be “right” in your head so just let it go. Yolo",1753055089.0,97,6,socialanxiety,anxiety

Welcome to r/HealthAnxiety. Check out our community user flairs, and attach one to your username!

Use this megathread for vents, rants, worries, fixations, DAEs, finding support/advice, finding reassurance, symptom focused content, or the like. If you are mainly focused on your physical symptoms, this would be the thread to use. You may also be redirected here if you choose not to follow rule #3 regarding post titles, if it is categorized as one of the post types above, or if the content is too detailed. Remember this is not a place to give or ask for medical/pharmaceutical/veterinary advice, or promote/sell alternative medicines/therapies/products/subscriptions. Please focus on ""**Health Anxiety""** which is defined [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/health-anxiety)**.** Please avoid displacing others who are looking for support regarding their health anxiety by using other appropriate subreddits for things that are non-HA related  ( r/Anxiety, r/depression, r/AskDocs, r/socialanxiety, r/mentalhealth ). Take the time to comment on each other's entries to show some support while we traverse through HA together. 

Only post a standalone thread if it mainly includes the mental aspect of Health Anxiety. **Everything else goes in this thread.** This megathread is used to prevent any unnecessary distress on somebody who is not mentally prepared to engage with the above content (Imagine scrolling down on your main general feed to relax, but bump into something distressing instead). HA is very unique in which it is very easy for someone to read something/experiences and then come out thinking you may have something after reading it. This is why we take these precautions and use a megathread as navigating through social media is one of the many challenges that our community members face on a daily basis. We are here to accommodate everyone at various stages of their HA. To address visibility concerns the thread is sorted by ""New"", so that it acts as its own reddit feed. An example of a post would be redirected here: 

* **""Does anyone else feel like this?"" +  ""Insert Symptoms""** \-> Use this megathread

**Although not required** we do encourage the use of: 1) **A trigger warning header (TW)** which gives warning to redditors of what the comment will be discussing about, and/or 2) **Spoiler text** which blocks out any details that redditors may accidentally read >!and find distressing.!< You can apply this via two methods:

1mek643,Daily Positivity & HA Journey Progress Updates [MEGATHREAD]. Month of August 2025.,"**The megathread for vents, rants, worries, fixations, DAEs, finding support/advice, finding reassurance, symptom focused content, or the like is located here :** [**http://reddit.com/r/healthanxiety/about/sticky**](http://reddit.com/r/healthanxiety/about/sticky) Thank you for using the above thread for the above content as some users may experience distress if they were to unexpectedly read content that they were not mentally prepared to engage with or are just trying to take a breather from. 
___

The average person has 50,000 thoughts per day according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/turn-around-negative-thinking/). Of those thoughts: 95 percent repeat each day and on average, **80 percent of repeated thoughts are negative.**

This means that on average, only 20% of our thoughts are positive per day and they are competing for our attention with the other 80%. This 80% has megaphones but you know what, **we are not helpless**.

* We can help the 20% of our positive thoughts shine brighter and dominate these negative thoughts. This is where ""marinating in the positive"" and contributing to the daily positivity thread in any way you can comes into play. **Attitude is a choice.**

Let's fill this thread with some positivity from our daily lives and remind ourselves that positive things are happening while we battle the negative thoughts of health anxiety. **Some examples of things you can post include:**

* Examples of positive self talk that you use for yourself (which will give others ideas that they can use for themselves regarding positive self talk).
* Ordinary things you are grateful for (ex: your car started today or there is water to drink).
* Small goals & victories you have accomplished.
* Something you witnessed that made you smile, or something you did to make someone else smile.
* Blessings, gratitude, and other positive observations in your life.
* Accomplishments of self-care.
* Something you created today (crafts, art, a meal...).
* Find accountability buddies and report your self progress for some type of challenge.
* Declaration of choosing a predominantly positive attitude in regards to HA or other aspects of life.
* Examples of mental imagery you use for yourself to prepare for situations and/or recover from errors.
* Declaration of acknowledgement and/or acceptance of certain things in your life (ex: emotions, health anxiety, etc).
* Declaration of using a negative experience as a stepping stone in life to improve and get closer to your goals rather than let it interfere with your progress.
* Declaration of living life in the ""here and now"", without regard to either the past or anticipated future events.
* Declaration of ditching perfectionism and choosing to strive for excellence instead for something in your life (ex: ""being perfect"" vs ""being good enough"").

**REGARDING ""journey updates"" standalone post**: Some of you may have been redirected here if you are providing an update on your progress via a standalone post. If you would like your standalone post to be approved, please resubmit the ""update post"" with advice in the text body (such as detailing how you got there, or what motivated you to get to where you are now, etc). This is so redditors can gain something from your post without feeling bad that they are not where you are currently at on their own journey. The reason we do this is that Reddit is another form of social media where many can fall victim to the social comparison trap. We do not want people to feel inadequate by comparing themselves to someone else's health anxiety management journey. This is why we ask redditors to include advice in their progress updates if they want it to be a standalone thread. This way people can gain information for their health anxiety management roadmaps from your post. Feel free to resubmit your post with advice added on if you want it to be a standalone post. Thank you for your cooperation.

Focus on your day. Nothing bad is happening right now.”* The other voice is anxious: *“But what if…? What if you missed something important? What if you’re not safe? What if you ignored a sign?”* It’s exhausting going back and forth between those voices all day. Even when nothing is actually wrong, the worry still feels so real.I’ve been trying to use grounding techniques (breathing, focusing on surroundings, journaling), but some days it feels like I’m stuck in a constant debate with myself.

Its really dificult to zoom out on those days but i keep an humour story that my grandpa told me:

Once upon a time, there was a man who, every single day, would say, “Oh, I’m going to die, oh, I’m going to die.”
He did this every day for 70 years.
After 70 years, the man died at the age of 85, of natural causes.

1movug4,Balancing HA with watching out for your health responsibly,"As I’m dealing with health anxiety, I’m noticing that something I am really struggling with balancing is regularly watching out for yourself and crossing the line to HA territory where you body check and ruminate about everything. It’s tricky to navigate because you are trying your best not to fuel the fear but when does that become negligence for yourself? 

I’m currently dealing with a situation where I just had a dental check up last week and the past few days noticed something different (which I discovered from body checking unfortunately.) I want to go to the dentist again but I keep telling myself that would not make sense and is just reassurance seeking since I just went as recent as last week. I have to keep reminding myself that they are professionals and would have alerted me of anything concerning when I was there (but there’s  always a sliver of doubt in my mind that maybe they didn’t look close enough). 

How do you all suggest to keep a balance of not running to the doctor at the first signs of trouble but also not being negligent. I am trying my best to hold off on going to the dentist about my question until my wisdom tooth removal in Nov (unless it of course escalates). Hopefully, I can hang on till then!

As a GAD / health anxiety sufferer I’ve been working on a small idea and I’d love your honest feedback.

I’m experiencing a really severe bought of health anxiety atm because of some symptoms that have been going on for about a month now - have convinced myself it’s something life threatening! 

I’ve been to doctor to doctor to doctor and each is telling me it’s anxiety + can’t match the illness I think I have and they all seem really kind and like they are knowledgeable - but my lovely brain won’t take it! I get relief for about an hour after an appointment and then it sneaks in ‘what if they missed it again…?’

So! Does anyone have any stories where they were convinced they had something and it ended up truly just being health anxiety or anxiety related and the doctors were right? because you can see so many stories of the opposite and I want this stress to end if it’s unnecessary!

1mltjad,How saying “I don’t care if I die” cured my anxiety in my teens.,"So I had pretty severe HA in my teens for 3 years straight, was heavily medicated (risperidal, dumirox and alprazolam) and nothing seemed to work.

Then, in an act of complete desperation and because my life was a misery I said: I’m gonna go out and if I die it’s ok

Since that day all the fear of death that was giving power to my HA vanished and consequently my simptoms started to gradually disappear.

10 years later (rn) I’m struggling again with HA and thinking: we have to found a deeper cure to this - some motto that is bigger than life and so removes our fear of death - but as I am not desperate rn I can’t say “fuck it” and cure myself that way

Edit: if we think - one of the way out of this is finding something worth living for (with the odds of something going wrong) , normally religion and philosophical mottos can help I think (I am not religious and I think that could help)

But it was all in my head and my body was nervous at any little zap in the body, I was on edge all the time, triggers by any feeling. So the healing began when a started to teach my cells that I was totally okay, so when triggered I had to talk to myself as if I was a little kid and reassure my inner child he was okay,  had the fully feel the sensations and make friends with them, doing this over and over till the cells didn't fire off or spiral into panic, acknowledge the feeling feel it accept them reassure myself and move on.

No more abandoning myself, it was a a struggle and a fight at times but also started to feel good and a smile would come, chipping away each day, changing routine, being a bit more adventurous out the comfort zone. Some tactics would be laughing at the feelings and telling the thoughts to f off and moving on anyway (the body's like ok let's go it's ok now, the cells are changing less reactive.

1mlajzl,How I Beat Health Anxiety,"One of the biggest things that snapped me out of health anxiety was realizing how irrational my fear focus really was.

Take these numbers (U.S. averages):
	•	Car crash (motor vehicle accident):
Lifetime odds of dying = 1 in 93 (~1.07%)
	•	Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma:
Lifetime odds of dying = 1 in 300 (~0.33%)

That means you’re 3× more likely to die in a car crash than from lymphoma.

And if we’re talking about life-altering injury, your odds of becoming severely paralyzed from a car accident are also higher than the lymphoma you’re stressing about.

Now here’s the kicker:
Most of us never get anxious stepping into a car. We take Ubers with complete strangers, having zero proof they’re sober or even competent drivers. We let them take us 70mph down a highway without a second thought.

But with health anxiety, we selectively focus on the least likely catastrophic scenarios, obsess over them, and give them more mental weight than the everyday risks we completely ignore.

When I reframed it like this - I’m literally choosing to fear the smaller risk and ignore the bigger one - my brain had a harder time taking the health fears seriously.

Bottom line:
If you can handle the risk of getting in a car every day, you can handle the risk of something 3× less likely. You’re already living with far bigger dangers - and you’re fine.

1mkjoeu,PLEASE READ IF CBT/Talk Therapy isn’t working,"Lots of people might feel trapped by health anxiety even with therapy and feel they can only get relief on drugs. 

Something that might help everyone out: I haven’t found much success treating this with regular CBT and talk therapy. More and more therapists are considering HA/IAD/Hypochondria under the OCD umbrella, specifically linked to Sensorimotor/Somatic OCD where we hyperfixate on our body and its functions (breathing, heart rate, vision, globus sensation, etc…) it’s becoming more and more understood as OCD because constant doctors visits, Google searches, reassurance seeking are compulsive behaviors that might make the anxiety subside in the moment but always make it come back stronger as it reinforces the cycle. 

OCD cannot be treated with typical talk therapy or CBT. In fact it can make it worse. OCD CAN however be successfully treated with ERP (exposure therapy) and ACT (acceptance therapy). 

I was being administered CBT and it didn’t work. Nothing seemed to help no matter what and I thought I was an unfixable case. It was only until I went to a psychiatrist and he determined I had OCD with my theme centered around bodily functions and health. Treatment with ERP has had FAR better success for me.

1mj9g5x,HA people with anxiety related to your GI system get in here,"Having HA with GI fears sucks because your anxiety can further fuel the ""symptoms"" (aka normal fluctuations in bodily functions) and make you believe you have evidence that something is seriously wrong with your body, or will be soon. If you have ever experienced this, you know how debilitating and scary it can be. Ultimately a good medication routine is what worked for me after years and years of trying CBT and other methods of anxiety reduction. However, even on medication that has vastly improved my life I would occasionally have some ""symptoms"" that would cause a lot of anxiety. Sure it was better with the medication; I could focus on work, I could focus on hobbies, but it was still affecting my day-to-day life. It was still one of the first things I thought about each morning. 

What finally worked for GI specific fears and somatic symptoms is an app I saw in an ad on FB called ""Nerva"". I was highly skeptical but was pretty desperate at the time. Also, it was actually advertised and marketed at people with IBS, which I did not and do not have. But I tried it and it has worked wonders for me. It talks a lot about your GI system specifically (sounds silly but you'll eventually hear things like ""your intestines will work at a speed that is right and normal for you"" as part of the session) and it really works. At least, it did for me. A lot of people with real GI diseases e.g. IBD also claim it works to help reduce their symptoms, so keep in mind you should still obviously get examined if you have red flag symptoms. For me, I saw immediate changes after the first week of just listening to the daily sessions which are like 15 min. Now, I just check in about once a year when I have a flare up of this GI anxiety and I start having BMs that trigger anxiety. After a couple weeks, I'm back to normal and living my life. Unfortunately it is really expensive IMO at $200/yr or $78/3 months. There may be cheaper alternatives, I'm not sure. For me, it's totally worth it. Just a suggestion for anyone out there suffering.

1mgip13,Health Anxiety Success Story,"Hi. I wanted to introduce myself. I am a 49 year old guy who has been married 20 years, two daughters 18 and 14 and I had debilitating health anxiety for 14 years without a day respite. 

I have now been 15 years without any health anxiety whatsoever. 

I always wanted to come back and help people and now feels like the perfect time.

Here are some details about the severity of health anxiety I had

* I thought I had over 27 terminal illnesses through the 15 years, like convinced
* I spent £15000 on medical testing, doctors and more (I was not rich I just used all my money on it)
* I googled symptoms maybe 8 hours a day.
* I could tell you the deepest stats on any disease I thought I had, im talking VERY deep stats, age of incidence, survival, stage, demographic, ethnicity, location, new treatments, palliative care options 0 you name it.

I read 20+ books on OCD, CBT, Fear of death, health anxiety and more. I watched hundreds of videos. I saw countless doctors. It overtook my life.

Here are my thoughts and I am happy to help anyone that needs it. It was personal to me so each person is different but here is what worked and didn't work

**What did not work**

* Using logic. This is not a logical ""disorder"" or whatever you want to call it. You could have age by incidence of 1 in 500,000 and still ""I could be that one""
* Searching Google (of course). Self confirming bias here makes searching Google a waste of time at best and utterly destructive at worst
* Multiple second opinions. You can have clean tests and many second opinions but this might still stay or will likely move on to something else
* Self checking...... I found things you would not believe when self checking, I spent 6 months obsessing over a part of my head that turns out is normal anatomy :) 

**The Aha Moment**

*  I was trying to treat myself for health anxiety but I had OCD really and thought patterns that were the harmful thing, health just was the thing they latch onto
* I had to find a way to get my mind to move on and to mean it. To change the knee jerk reaction of thoughts that sent me down a spiral of more and more to a knee jerk reaction that I trained myself to get to where I acted if I needed to and moved on if I could not act. It had to happen almost instantly and this took practice.
* I basically had to reverse the thought patterns. So I studied fight and flight responses, anxiety cycles in the brain, chemicals released and all the different methods. 

**I then developed something that worked for me**

*  Exercise. Learn to trust your body by moving it and getting stronger. If you cannot then just move your foot up and down or ANYTHING a little more than yesterday. Progress, the antithesis of deterioration.
* Medication. Personally venalflaxine although a horrid SNRI - worked for me to allow me to do the proper work. Not suggesting you take it, just what worked for me to get me to a state to ""do the work""

Then the method I made. I call it the Flip Method. 

* learn to notice your thoughts as if from a third party
* Assess them quickly and objectively, does this need action? Really? If yes, take the action right away and Flip the thought to ""I have done all I can and move on""
* If no action can be taken Flip the thought to ""I have done all I can and move on""
* Do something else

This method although very simple does the following

* Allows you to be an observer of thoughts rather than in them
* Takes action when needed (not just finger in ears and distraction
* The closing thought part starts to reassure your subconscious each time you are ok (may sound woo woo, I am not like that, try it)
* The speed of it is key. Repetitive thoughts can be flipped super fast under 4 seconds.
* It needs to be practiced, it will take time, it will become a healthy knee jerk reaction to repetitive thoughts.

Now when I say I am not anxious I truly do mean it. I have many flaws, anxiety does not have any hold on me whatsoever though and mentally I am completely free. 

My life was overtaken by this to a level most would find ridiculous, the stories I have are utterly absurd and for YEARS of my life.

This is very treatable.

I am very happy to help and would love to get some people out of this as I know better than most how hard it is and what it looks like both sides.

Low blood volume makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. In order to pump more blood, **the body up regulates sympathetic nervous system. Anxiety is a state of sympathetic over-activation.**

So i don't know which of the 2 is responsible for my HA reduction: more calories or more salt. If i would have to guess, i currently lean more towards the salt. The timing fits better.

**Also, this isn't medical advice. My diet is heavily tailored to ME.**",1753950414.0,27,4,HealthAnxiety,anxiety
1mdih26,"Health Anxiety and the ""Packed Bags"" theory","I came across mention of this ""packed bags"" concept in the writing of a Hindu/Indian guru. Though in the book he doesn't mention or discuss Health Anxiety, I feel that this theory can be linked to Health Anxiety. 

So hear me out. 

Imagine you need to go on a weeklong vacation overseas. You need to leave at 6 pm today to catch your non-refundable flight.Ideally you start packing at least the day before and finish packing by 4 pm. Now you can relax. But if you sit doomscrolling or playing games on your phone till 5.45 pm, your bags still empty, your clothes still in the washer (not even in the dryer!), That is a recipe for severe anxiety and panic attacks. You scramble to throw some stuff in the bag and you are second guessing yourself at the airport. Did you even take your passport? Phone charger? You are going to the beach, did you take swimwear?


Same is true for any situation where you need packed bags ready. When your hotel room checkout is at 10 am, you want to make sure that your bags are packed and ready by 9 am so that you can then relax and enjoy the complimentary breakfast and don't have to worry about leaving stuff behind in the hotel room.


If you stay in an Airbnb for a month, you still need packed bags when it's time to leave. When you want to move out of the apartment you had for three years, you need to start packing at least one to two weeks in advance. You want your suitcases and boxes all packed up when the moving truck arrives. That's the only way to relax. 

If you are moving to another city or even country for a two year college course or job stint, then you not only need to pack all the important stuff in two suitcases, you also need to get rid of the not-so-important stuff.  Donate, sell, put in a storage facility. And take care of phone connection, bank accounts, incoming mail..


The reason we feel health Anxiety which ultimately is fear of death and /or disability is because our bags aren't packed. We haven't done the stuff we needed to do. Our affairs aren't in the order. Our ducks aren't in a straight line.  So we always feel like that person who needs to vacate her house tomorrow and has lots of mess and empty boxes all around her. How am I going to sort and pack everything in one day? 


So do the things you need to do. Ask yourself - what is the unpacked messy stuff in my life? How do I take care of that? Find your life purpose and start working towards it. Ask yourself how you can serve humanity, not just your own little self. Sort out your financial affairs and responsibilities.

Pack your bags. Sit with packed bags neatly lined up next to you- ready to board your flight when the announcement comes. Nobody is going to get out of boarding that flight. But if your bags are packed, you can enjoy the wait time. You are not worrying or second guessing. You are watching a movie or reading a book or enjoying food and drinks at the airport bar or shopping in the duty free section. ",1753909482.0,69,9,HealthAnxiety,anxiety
1mdbz62,i wish i could live my life again,"i cant even remember what it was like to not be constantly fixated on my thoughts all days every day. it's been over a year of this never ending spiral and it feels like i'll never get back out of it. no matter how much i'm told that my fears are irrational and that i need to just push myself, any small set back and it's as if i've gone 1 step forward 4 steps back. i'm constantly ruminating and catastrophising any small thought or sensation in my body to the point i dont even know if it's a real sensation or not. i stopped attending university, i havent seen friends in over a year, i can barely even get around that far by myself anymore. i used to be so active, it's like something switched all of a sudden. it's such a frustrating fear to have to live with. i'm trying and trying to push myself more, take those steps forward, build a routine, but if it's not the mental blockage, it's the physical impact that anxiety has had on me; i feel like such a shell of a person.

1md6u9z,This novel helped me at just the right time: A Spot of Bother by Mark Haddon,"After just having gone through a HA spiral (after my  2nd visit to the derm. ""just to make sure she didn't miss anything"" and my explaining that I sometimes suffer with HA, I feel OK thanks to her kindness...and also possibly due to me upping my sertraline dose and using ativan to fall asleep), I randomly picked up this book at a thrift shop: *A Spot of Bother* by Mark Haddon. Parts of it had me laughing out loud (which I can't remember ever doing while reading a book). I read it in 2 days.

I'm  not giving anything away that's not on the back cover of the book by saying that it's about a slightly dysfunctional family, but the main protagonist (George) is a 57 yo man who suddenly gets bowled over by extreme HA. The way the author describes George's descent into mental illness is extremely accurate and humorous at the same time, and can be appreciated no matter how old you are (I've had bouts of HA since my early teens). The humor comes from the author uncannily describing  EXACTLY how I've felt and the silly and stupid things I've done, and as you read George going through it (e.g., he goes to see ""Lord of the Rings"" to get his mind off of his HA, but his horror at seeing the Orcs for the first time  had me guffawing), I saw how ultimately absurd my thinking was/had been/probably will be again at some time in the future.

I (26 F) have been suffering with health anxiety for around 5 years now and am in a complete spiral lately. I recently have had some real diagnosed health problems, nothing major, but they did require me having to wait for test results. It's been around a month now of multiple tests and waiting periods and at this point I feel like I am going crazy. It's distanced me from friends and family, I feel completely irrational sometimes and other times I'm completely convinced that I'm right, the doctors are missing things, blah blah blah. I just feel so alone. Tonight I've been trying to distract myself by watching true crime YouTubers because it's something I enjoy, but after speaking to my therapist I can recognize that the media I consume might be affecting my mindset lately. I have no idea why I am drawn to these things, medical documentaries, scary true stories, that can not be helping me at all but it feels compulsive at this point.

I wish my brain wasn't my brain. I've had different anxiety fixations since I was a young child, from debilitating fear that my parents would get sick, small spaces, being abducted. I'm a worst case scenario thinker and am now realizing I'm filling my brain and time with worst case scenario media.

So here I am making an effort to watch something else and this has gone on so long that I don't know what to watch instead, maybe something to make me laugh would be nice. Something calming or distracting would work too!

When I was 20, I finally went to the doctor, and I was diagnosed with OCD, GAD, and MDD. I’ve been on so many different mental health meds since.

Anyway, over the last fourteen years, I go back and forth between obsessing over something involving my own health and something involving my loved one’s health.

So I have to pay for private clinics. I have spent insane amount of money and I don't know what to do.

I'm in a loop. I worry about something (lets say my kidneys) I get so panicked that I can't do anything else. I go to the doctor, see that everything is fine. I get relaxed for like 1 hour, than find something else to worry. So I repeat all.

I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t even know what’s a symptom anymore and what’s a side effect. Like am I tired because of the condition or because of the med? Is the brain fog from my body or my treatment? It’s such a mess to untangle.

Do you guys go off gut instinct? Give it a strict timeline or keep trying stuff until something feels right? I feel like I’m just throwing darts and hoping one finally hits the target.

1matfg5,Progress in my first health anxiety relapse after 3 years free from it: nearly there again!,"Hello everyone! Just wanted to share my bit of experience. I have general anxiety since I was a child. I developed HA as a young adult after my first 100% random and unprompted panic attack in 2017, thinking it was a heart issue (apparently this is not an uncommon trigger for people with HA). In 2021, after finishing CBT and my SSRI treatment, I was completely healed from general anxiety & HA (as in, the thoughts were exceptionally rare and fleeting).

Last autumn, a ridiculous but \*huge\* HA trigger made me fall into my first full-blown anxiety (and HA) relapse after almost 3 years of total healing of anxiety. It was humbling and very difficult, but I immediately talked about it to my doctor, saw a therapist a few times and applied all that I had learned into CBT. It sloooowly got better and better. Some days are harder than others but when I look back, the progress is there, month by month, week by week.

My HA is still here, although it's ""low-grade"" at least compared to what it was. I say I'm nearly there because all I need now is to stop worrying ""quicker"" about my physical symptoms and stop googling (I do it way less than before therapy but, you guys know it, it's easy to fall back into the habit!)

What helps me the most at this stage, and what I want to highlight the most for other people who go through HA and read this... is the ""2 weeks rule"" where I book NO doc appointment and if the symptom worrying me is still there after 2 weeks, I do. But so far it could be a three day rule - and I haven't seen the doctor since February! ☺ 

Even though it still is here every day, it is amusing and greatly helps rationalising to see that my symptoms change so often. It's like my anxiety is pushing the buttons. I have various aches... but they keep travelling from from one body part or organ to another. Every week or so it changes. My HA is a creature and it's travelling, I hope it's having fun 😂

Remember, the body is always doing normal, and healthy things such as digestion, hormone fluctuations, etc. It also, you know it, reacts to stress. So, various aches, discomforts are normal and temporary, and they are enhanced by anxiety or HA. They'll pass, you will see. Yes, even what you feel right now, you who are reading me! :)

Anyway, that's where I'm at currently. Any of you have experienced total healing and then relapses? Are you progressing in your journey, noticing you catastrophise a bit less than you did a few months or years ago?

Stay strong everyone, be gentle with yourself, and be patient. Healing is possible!

1m9m56x,"As of today, I’m in remission of Health Anxiety! What worked for me:","Hello, fellow fighters! Today I had my final cognitive behavioural therapy session. I started therapy in September 2023, so it’s been roughly 2 years of therapy for me and I’m finally seeing the results.

A quick background of my story: I had an actual health episode which required me extensive lifestyle changes. During the process, I developed health anxiety, ended up in ER multiple times (to the point that I was kicked out of hospitals for wasting their time) Once, I even got a card by mail from ambulance workers with chocolate, for being their “preferential customer”. 

I looked for therapy because I had a combination of HA and panic attacks, which was very severe. I didn’t leave home, developed anorexia, my life quality was REALLY bad. And now I’m living normally, completely unburdened by HA! 

I want to share with you everything I learned in therapy, in hopes that this will help you as well in your recovery journey. 

—————

WHAT HELPED:

**Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)**. Goes without saying, *every person with HA should do it*. HA is an anxiety but it also has ties with obsessive-compulsive disorders, and both groups respond REALLY well to CBT. It’s the gold standard of treatment.

**Grounding skills.** This was really useful in the beginning. When your HA is too elevated and you have panic attacks, it’s important to learn how to stop a panic attack. There are many grounding skills; my favourite one is the 54321 senses (“Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste”). This is important to take you away from the spiral.

**Identify your triggers**. At first your therapist might ask you to take inventory of your health anxiety. What are your concerns? What are your fears? Did you have a panic attack? On a scale of 0-10 how bad was it? What time did it happen? How did you feel? What did you do? How long did it take for you to feel better again? This is important because you start seeing patterns, and understanding how your own health anxiety works.

**At first, reducing exposure to triggers**. I had to be accountable and NOT Google. Or use AI. The cycle of compulsion and reassurance is what keeps HA alive. Cutting it off is fundamental. Instead, whenever you have a health concern: list it in a paper first. Go to a doctor and get this checked only once. Whatever your doctor says, take notes and refer to it.

**Creating “safety” cards**. Once you go to a doctor, write cards with their assessment. And reminders to yourself: “I’ve checked this. I am safe. There is no reason for worry. I am fine.” These are meant to be used as an emergency but they do help before you spiral down.

**Interoceptive exposure**. This is SO important! Your therapist might notice you have a certain fear related to a certain bodily sensation. So they will expose you to it, in a very controlled environment. Very gradually, you will develop resilience and desensitise yourself. Meaning your brain will stop bothering you whenever you feel something over time.

**Journaling**. This is more of a general mental health tip but with health anxiety it is really great because you can start noticing that you have survived X episodes, you have kept living despite thinking you have something. You also start noticing what are the things you pay attention to in your daily life, and can choose to start paying attention to other things instead.

**Emotional education**. Together with therapy, I did a free course from Therapy in a Nutshell (a YouTube channel) for Anxiety and Processing your Emotions. They are not directly associated with Health Anxiety but did teach many CBT skills to have a better life overall.

**Workbooks**. Your therapist might want you to do health anxiety workbooks. They are guided exercises that greatly help you. My favourite ones were from the government of Australia (should be one of the first ones that appear when you google “Health Anxiety workbook”, and Steven Hayes’s “Get out of your mind and into your life”.

**Be willing to accept risk**. This is, admittedly, the hardest part of treatment, and where you get your “make or break” moment. You have to be really intentional and honest with yourself: do you want to live a fully realised and authentic life, or do you want to be a slave to your fears forever? HA is about demanding reassurance because our brains crave reassurance, but we live in a world full of uncertainty and no one can give you 100% of a correct answer. The best doctor in the world could miss something. No one can predict anything. *Everybody lives despite their fears, not in spite of them.* I still remember how great it felt to leave home for the first time in a year, in the middle of winter (a major trigger for me), and feel the snow flakes falling from the sky. I literally cried of joy.

**Understanding that anxiety is an emotion and you can’t get rid of it**. Anxiety itself is not a problem. It is very important for our lives! The problem is our dysfunctional relationship to it.

**Knowing you can’t be “cured” of HA - but you do go on remission**. During therapy I had excellent progress as well as setback episodes. Setback episodes don’t mean you are doing worse. It means you’re human. And eventually after remission your HA might come back - but the difference now is that you are well equipped to deal with it on your own, and not let it fester.

I wish everyone courage to feel their emotions and sensations, and the vulnerability to live a full and beautiful life. Paraphrasing Emma McAdam on her Processing Emotions course: “The goal is not for you to feel better; the goal is for you to get better at feeling”.

1m7qgyu,HA representations in media,"hi, i did a brief search on here but i was wondering if anyone has new recommendations on media centered around someone with HA?

i watched a film in my college french class called ""Cléo de 5 à 7"" (Cleo from 5 to 7) by Agnès Varda. it really touched me as the main character is convinced the whole time she is going to die (from a psychic reading) and i feel like her obsession and seeing things in the passerby, street, etc. helped comfort me with the sense that it is an irrational fear, but at the same time it captured the complexity of health fears and it wasn't just comedic. 

I've seen recommendations for Turtles All the Way Down. is there anything else you've seen/listened to/read recently relating to HA that could be helpful with its representation?

I’ve been in therapy (CBT) for two years and I’ve had significant progress to the point I’m two sessions away from being discharged - as my therapist thinks I am in remission. Yay!

This week though, something ALMOST set me off. I went to a beach house with friends for a swim. I live in the Nordics and the water is notoriously chilly, even in summer. 

When coming home, I saw a blue spot on my foot. All my health anxiety alarms started to set off. I started thinking about the worst. I got really tense and was nearly falling in an obsessive spiral trying to figure out things. Was it a hematoma? A broken vessel? Was it the cold water? The ginger drink I had? Or worse?

Then I remembered my therapist’s advice: *“just because you think something, it doesn’t mean it’s true. It doesn’t mean you’re right.”*

And as I let that sink in, I tried to let go of obsessive thoughts by relaxing my shoulders, taking a deep breath, looking at my sandals…

… and there it was, a smashed blackcurrant.

I had conflated a blackcurrant stain with a hematoma.

I couldn’t stop laughing my way home. I haven’t had my session yet with my therapist, but I hope she will laugh about it too.

When getting stuck on some silly obsessive thought, remember: your brain is good at finding whys and at being wrong. Not everything is dangerous. Take a step back, focus on something else… and who knows. You may even find out accidentally an answer, and a silly one at that 😀

Please know that time is the biggest help. And with time, just like your current health anxiety fixation came, it will too go. Remember how you felt several months ago when you weren’t worrying about what you’re worrying about right now. In time you WILL feel like that again.

1m4eon1,The important thing I learned from a recent bout with health anxiety,"Thirteen years ago I beat leukemia.  And ever since then I've had health anxiety.  It has gotten easier to control over the years, but it's always there - lurking, lingering in the back of my mind.  And recently it came storming back like a bat out of hell.

Back in March, I got a cyst removed from my eyelid that I'd had for over five years.  It never bothered me, but it had very slowly gotten a little bit bigger.  I thought it was a chalazion.  Pathology came back - it was a fibrous nodule with ""atypical mast cells, benign in nature"".  The recommendation was to get my blood tested, just to be sure. Not exactly what I wanted to hear.

About a week later, I suddenly had some issues involving my groin and left testicle.  It stuck around for a few days, and I started to worry.  Bathroom run at work? Testicular self-exam. Shower at home? Testicular self-exam. Sometimes more than five times per shower. Sleeping on my side, with my legs together, became nearly impossible because of this sensitivity. Then my mind really started to wander.  Are the eyeball cyst and this newfound issue somehow related?  Worrying led to Google.  Google led to Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.  MCAS led to an issue with my blood.  Again.  There it was.  It's back. Its been thirteen years, and it's back, in some crazy new way that's affecting two completely different parts of my body.

Instant gratification - I need to solve this, and solve it now.  I can't produce at my job with this weighing on me.  I can't wait to see a doctor.  I need this groin issue to go away - NOW.  I'm single - who the FUCK do I talk to about this?  So, I talked to a doctor on a video call while on my break at work.  $35 and you're connected to a ""doctor"" instantly.  She prescribed an antibotic - a potent antibiotic, thinking I had some sort of testicular infection.  Took that for 10 days, nothing changed.  I tried to suppress the worry, to work throught the stress.  I became impatient, impulsive, and rude.  I called my old oncologist, whom I hadn't spoken to in years.  I got up at work, walked out of my office, and called him in the parking lot.  I needed reassurance.  I needed answers.  He told me he couldn't diagnose me, but told me not to worry.  It didn't work.  I started to lose weight - a few coworkers commeted on it.  My muscles ached.  I downloaded an app which let me order Valtrex - antiviral for herpes, which I've never had.   I didn't know what else to do.  Had a urology appointment the following week, but couldn't wait for answers.

Fast forward a week, the Valtrex did nothing.  Its been three weeks and the issue hasn't gone away.  Every little bruise or itch I get has me thinking the worst.  I'm staring at myself in the mirror, dissecting what I see.  I notice that the left side of my neck is slightly larger than the right side (I've always had this).  ""It's a lymph node,"" I think.  I start aggressively feeling for a mass in my neck, before I go to bed, as I'm driving to work, while I'm at work, while I'm on the couch.  Imagining this swollen lymph node has me convinced that it's actually there.  Swollen lymph nodes can be a sign of leukemia.  I have to force myself to stop.  *""I have a bump on my eye, I'm losing a little weight, my testicle aches, I'm not eating as much, I have a mass in my neck.  I'm going to die.""*

Urologist does an exam, doesn't suspect an infection.  Can't find anything suspicious on the testicle.  Pee test comes back clear.  Does a basic physical exam, feels a tiny little protrusion.  ""I think you have a hernia,"" he says.  Imaging confirms this - not one, but THREE small hernias, all three in my inguinal canal (the groove at the hip, where the leg meets the groin).  I make an appointment to have them surgically fixed.  Turns out, they can cause referred issues to the entire area, including the private parts, because they move the nerves in that area around.  And he tells me that as my body gets used to the hernias, the symptoms should subside.

Within a few days, the issues with the groin and testicle completely disappear.  But, BUT!!  A new issue arises.  Constipation.  Bad constipation, and an associated loss of appetite.  No matter how hard I try, I can't go to the bathroom.  And when I take a softener, all that comes out is a little bit of liquid.  Not pretty, I know.  But this constipation persists.  I feel full fast.  And this leads to a whole new round of Googling.  These are things I actually Googled:

* inguinal hernia and constipation
* can inguinal hernias paralyze the bowel
* symptoms of bowel \*\*ncer
* prostate \*\*ncer and hernias
* how MCAS affects the bowel

So there I am, with one issue solved, but another one happening.  I can't help but think that all of this is related by some bigger, unknown, deadly cause.  Are the hernias *really* causing these digestion issues?  My dad, noticing the worry on my face, hands me a book called ""Fiber Fueled"".  It has now been since May 8th that I had that video call with the doctor.  I flip to the index and read every page that mentions constipation.  I decide to follow the book's advice.  I start eating sauerkraut by the forkfull.  Daily probiotics, magnesium, and fiber.  Lots of fiber.  No dairy, six different fresh sources of fiber a day.  I've never eaten as many kiwis in my life.  I become a new owner of a squatty potty.  I'm desperate to poop again, starting to worry that I'll never have another normal BM in my life.  That dreaded \*\*ncer word keeps sounding off in my mind.  Not for the testicle this time, but for the bowel.

Last Wednesday, I start to feel really gassy.  Probably a good thing, I think.  It means something's happening down there.  Then, a poop.  A small poop, but a poop nonetheless.  Friday for lunch, my boss orders food.  I wolf down a Five Guy's cheeseburger like there's no tomorrow, and realize that my appetite is back.  Yesterday?  I wake up.  Coffee, feeling like a poo.  And I sit, and OH, THE GLORY!!!! WHAT A POOP!!! Followed by anoher one at lunch.  And another one, four hours later.  I'm releasing massive amounts of it, weeks of blockage.  It is a magical day.

And then this morning, I sit up in bed and realize....that the stress is gone.  That I feel happy.  That I *want* to eat breakfast.  I go to the gym, run five miles on the treadmill.  Eat a big lunch, no bloat.

I'm back.

And that's the story about how several unrelated things, and some bad timing, and some panic, led me down a very dark path for the last 2 1/2 months.  The eye thing?  Completely unrelated to everything else.  I just chose to have it sent to pathology right before my lower half went haywire.  Benign, like the pathology report had originally said.  The testicular/groin issue?  Three small hernias, that I probably got at the gym, and aggravated during a particularly labor intensive day at work (sometimes, I'm out in the field).  The constipation?  A gut imbalance, my intestines completely wrecked by the medications I took for the testicle issue, poor decisions that I made in a state of panic.  Medications that were completely unnecessary and did NOTHING but harm.  Medications that made me sore and suppressed my appetite.  A gut imbalance that was healed by some probiotics, prunes, patience, and kiwis.

And so, what I've learned is that if there's a simple explanation, and a simple path to follow, that is usually the right answer.  For me, thinking that I was dying (thanks, Google!) was really a few hernias and a simple case of disbyosis, healed by following the program in that book my dad handed to me.  The first time he told me ""you need to eat more fruits and vegetables"", I shrugged it off - I almost laughed at him.

""*What's going on here is way more complicated than that!""*

Turns out, it wasn't.  And all that stress, all that panic, all that worry that I've had since early May, was avoidable.  I made it worse by giving in to the anxiety, and by making brash decisions in the heat of the moment.

The mind is a very powerful thing.  Through a combination of anxiety and stress, I had *convinced* myself I was sick, so much so that I created a lump in my neck that was never really there. So much so that the stress in my body said hey, let's stop eating for a little while.  Let's lose a little weight.

So, the next time you're going through it, take a step back, breathe, stay off of Google, and remember that the human body is very, very good at solving its own issues.  Don't let the panic take over.  Drink water, eat healthy, sleep, and do the basics.  Breathe.",1752981364.0,167,26,HealthAnxiety,anxiety

- your body is like a house. it will make noise, creak and slightly ache as it settles. 
- you would not think someone else with your symptoms has anything dangerous, so why would you think that about yourself?
- you are significantly more likely to die from your next car ride than whatever you are panicking about, most likely. but a friend offered you a ride to somewhere, youd likely still take it. 
- being aware of something doesnt make it more likely to happen. 
- you should be at the club, not staring at your shit. 
- if you were dying, you wouldnt be wondering whether you were dying. it would feel REAL. 
- so many people live wildly unhealthy lives for decades, and theyre fine! you will be okay. 
- the chances of you having something rare and terminal, AND the doctors missing something key in your tests is so insanely small. they dont want to lose their medical lisences either. ",1753006687.0,37,10,HealthAnxiety,anxiety

Anyway, what I do is literally just focus on the OPPOSITE body part. Like literally put the fear in reverse and put it somewhere else in the body till it becomes clear that it’s just anxiety. 

Ex: if my left arm feels weird, I force myself to focus on the right arm, and eventually it’ll feel the same due to psychosomatic stuff, I can prove to myself it’s just anxiety. I hope this helps.

1m1r7ps,Avoiding triggers to deal with HA,"I tried my best with this post title, but it's still meh. Sorry about that lol :,)  
I think that a lot of people with HA can relate to me - I was really keen on reading and watching health content online. My whole FYP was flooded with videos about different illnesses, stories of those who had them, etc etc etc. I thought of it as ""educating myself just in case"" and ""being aware to catch it early"", but it's fairly obvious that it's just a compulsatory behavior.

I was consuming more and more of that content and meanwhile my anxiety was consuming more and more of myself - so one day I got fed up and muted a fair share of it. Muted Reddit communities, added banned words to Instagram, unfollowed quite a bit of accounts and persistently ignored triggering stuff that still managed to get through all that.

I got better after doing it, but I understand that I am just running from my fear and not getting desensitized as I should. But avoiding triggers \_for now\_ is obviously the best I could do. At the very least it's better than performing a compulsion on a daily basis.   
(To be honest, I also happen to find medicine generally interesting, but unfortunately my health anxiety prevents me from just observing it and not spiraling. It doesn't seem possible to separate my general curiosity from a HA thing at this point.)

I’m not looking for advice or to give any. I’d really just love to listen to your story. What your journey has been like, how it started, how you’re coping, and how things are going for you now. If you’re comfortable sharing, I’d be grateful to hear about it in DMs and maybe ask a few questions along the way.

No pressure at all , only if you feel safe and okay opening up.
Thanks for reading 😊",1752480747.0,10,15,HealthAnxiety,anxiety
1lzb0jv,How to bring up concerns to doctor? I don't want to seem attention seeking or overly anxious.,"I've been having some symptoms that are consistent with a rare disease. I've been visiting the doctor fairly frequently to get to the bottom of some symptoms and follow up with some other stuff, but each visit, I get too embarrassed to bring up what I'm actually anxious about. I'm afraid of looking like an attention seeker, or like one of those ""doctor google"" people who think they know better than their doctor. I also am afraid my concerns won't be properly addressed/tested and I'll still be left wondering if I have this disease.

I know I need to talk to my doctor about it because I just can't stop wondering about what my future will look like if I have this disease, and I feel like this kind of limbo just isn't sustainable.

There's also a free test that a research lab offers, but I'm debating taking it. On the one hand, I would just *know*, but on the other hand, I don't know how I would handle a positive result if I got one, especially having to bring that to my doctor and explain that I did a mail-in test from the internet lol.

Has anyone dealt with this? What helped you push through the embarrassment or fear?",1752460568.0,11,12,HealthAnxiety,anxiety
1lz7sk8,anxiety or intuition?,"my mom has had some symptoms of a bad illness recently and while we wait for results and for her ct scan to plan for the next steps, i cant help but to convince myself that im going to receive the worst news possible. 

while i try to tell myself that it’s just my anxiety and that im overanalyzing everything and making myself panic, im afraid that im actually right and it’s my gut feeling helping me stay prepared for what’s to come. 

is there a way to tell whether it’s your intuition helping out or if it’s your anxiety?? i don’t wanna be right but i also don’t wanna tell myself that everything will be okay while ignoring my gut. ",1752451160.0,12,17,HealthAnxiety,anxiety
1lzc0mh,Journaling? Or coping support,"Hi all, im 23F with death and health anxiety. Recently found something lumpish that I’m afraid is something bigger but I cannot make a drs appointment because I changed drs and they won’t let me make an appointment until the first of next month. I’m trying not to spiral but I feel so defeated. I’m afraid I have something. My therapist told me to journal my thoughts and feelings to work through it but being hispanic, my mom always told me not to put anything into the universe you don’t want coming true. That’s stuck with me since I was younger but im curious are there other coping mechanisms that work for others. ",1752463687.0,3,9,HealthAnxiety,anxiety
1lz3kj1,A song that helps me cope,"Ever since I had a rare, life-threatening illness (twice!) as a child, I’ve been a huge hypochondriac, hyper aware of every sensation in my body and always catastrophizing about what it could possibly be. Over the years, I’ve thought I’ve had everything, from aneurysms to flesh eating bacteria, all because I felt a slight sting in my head or because my skin looked a bit flaky. It got particularly bad in my mid twenties when I started having severe panic attacks—not only did I think I MIGHT die at any minute from some terrible disease, I KNEW I would die, any second now. I stayed up at night for days, constantly monitoring my pulse for any changes. I avoided going to the bathroom for as long as I could because I didn’t want to be found dead on the toilet. And when you spend such a long time KNOWING you’re going to die at any minute, it brings on quite a terrible existential crisis 😓. But that’s for another time. I’ve been better since, and one thing that’s helped me is being able to laugh at myself when my brain starts getting carried away. I wrote this song, which makes me feel better, so I wanted to share it with this community, in the hopes that if any one else has experienced what I have, it makes you feel better too:

I’m terrified that one day it isn’t anxiety and I miss my opportunity to save myself. How do you guys cope with this fear? How would somebody with health anxiety know if it’s anxiety or it’s a real emergency? ",1752280916.0,94,48,HealthAnxiety,anxiety

Does anybody have any tips on how on I can remain calm and in control? I’m generally pretty good at controlling low-level, day-to-day anxiety, but these kind of intense flare ups I just crumble.

1lxi6is,Going to try this method,"I dont like doc appointments which is why I havent set up check ups in 10 years. Lots of trauma that I am healing from regarding doctors.

1lx22zu,I stopped paying attention to the body part I am afraid of and the feeling stopped immediately.,"I am in particular fixation of a certain brain disease due to a vague ""veering left"" sensation when I walk and subjective slurred speech that nobody heard. This afternoon I am fed up with it and decided to stop paying attention to my legs... and guess what? I can't believe how good I feel because the ""imbalance sensation"" are gone when I am not paying attention to it. Though I still have other sensations and are struggling with other things.

  
Basically, to deny or confirm if you really have something concerning, the first step is paradoxically not to worry about it. Because the anxiety itself can create realistic feelings indistinguishable from genuine concerns, and you will never know if you have a real concern if you can't stop being anxious first.

I just deleted ChatGPT and i promised myself I would not Google any more reports/results, and I’ll just go with the flow and see what her doctors say instead of perhaps freaking out because of the internet.

1lwnvrs,How do I stop spiraling?,"Despite the utter irrationality of it, I am somehow convinced that I came into contact with and accidentally ingested the saliva of a rabid mouse, thinking it was only water and not washing my hands. Yes this is ridiculous. Yes this makes no sense. I have done tons of research finding that the probability of a mouse even becoming rabid is infinitesimally small, much less me coming into contact with one. Hospitals don't even give rabies shots for rodent bites because of how low the risk is.

And yet, here I am, 2 days after. I haven't slept, I can't eat. I keep running this stupid situation in my head, and its exhausting me. This is a common occurrence for me. Despite multiple anxiety medications and therapy visits, I always do this. How do I stop? I am so tired of spending my life afraid. Have any of you managed to break free?

Also I am sure that I have somehow screwed up where/if I was supposed to post this. I am just so tired and have found no solace in any other subreddits/forums. I understand if you want to berate me for that, but if you can even give me the smallest sliver of advice while doing so I would appreciate it.

Edit: I truly appreciate you all sharing advice as well as your own experiences. I am doing a bit better now, I have tried incorporating some of the practices mentioned in this thread and they have helped. The obsession is still at the back of my mind, and I'm sure it will stay there until my next ""medical disaster"" pops up, but my confidence in dealing with it has gone up (even if just a little).

1lvrhvq,Psychologist's advice for me and you.,"So, I've been going through a medical whirlwind, and I cry about it to my psych often. Here's what she said. Rules of thumb, if you will.

Googling is bad, especially in specific side effects and symptoms! Because it compiles EVERY possible aspect, especially meds side effects! (because companies have to list them.) Google also isn't likely to take the rareness of these symptoms and side effects into consideration either. You likely read things that a FRACTION of people experience but of course Google compiles all of it. She said to me... weigh the chances, possibilities and operate with occam's razor in mind. Essentially, it is lacking nuance.

About Reddit. When you research things, anecdotal evidence is usually not as impartial right? When people come to Reddit, they are coming with specific symptoms usually in SPECIFIC subreddits... essentially it is going to become a cycle of confirmation bias, once you start looking up your specific symptoms on reddit. This is what happened to me with the CUTI community, which I had to mute for my own sanity... She said, that mild things most likely won't have dedicated subreddits or posts with high engagement rates.

Most importantly, people who heal, get better and don't experience complications, are NOT LIKELY TO POST ON REDDIT! Of course you feel terrified of the illness you might or might not have because you are only reading negative stories and experiences. Look up success stories. If you really need advice, seek out doctors. If that is expensive, like it was for me so many times, people working at pharmacies are also available for questions and can give supplements/suggestions for medications. I did this when I in fact was diagnosed but was still experiencing weirdness mid treatment. :-)))) 

So, 1: Google isn't nuanced. 2: Reddit is biased. 3: DON'T keep yourself guessing, you are not a professional and you WILL spiral.

My psychiatrist advised to keep reminding myself of my own anxiety. I am constantly on high alert, and I am certain you guys are too. Before distractions, remind yourself of your hyper-vigilance. 

Stay calm, give any symptoms time. The body is INCREDIBLY complicated. Mom always says: It's really hard to die. True! She was attacked by a panther at her old job at a Zoo at age 21. Still alive and kicking! If the symptoms subside, the body is bodying. 3-4 days in, doctor. You will be okay. 

Much love.",1752088398.0,123,23,HealthAnxiety,anxiety
