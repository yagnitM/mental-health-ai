q4zeo1,Please read this before posting about feeling suicidal.,"There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest, most of us have been isolated, scared, lonely, and there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.

Unfortunately, most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals, an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.

That being said, I’m not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling, you are not alone. I may be doing well now, but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.

I have never regretted being stopped.

Since you are thinking of posting for help, you won't regret stopping yourself.

So, right now everything seems dark and you don’t see a way out. That’s ok. However, I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.

So what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.

First off, if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan, I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe, you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places, they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.

If you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head, let's start with some basics. When’s the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables, grains, and protein. If you can’t remember or it’s been more than 4 to 5 hours, eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.

Next, are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.

If you can’t sleep, try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.

If you’re hydrated, fed, and properly rested, ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it’s been a while. Call someone. It doesn’t matter who, just talk to an actual human being.

Go outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.

When is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love, pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.

When’s the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker, but doing things for others, helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.

When is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that’s OK.

You have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better, you just have to get through the dark stuff first.

You will be ok and you can make it through this.

We are all rooting for you.

1mqmncw,Therapist using chatGPT,"In my last therapy session after recently being diagnosed with OCD I asked my therapist if compulsions could be mental. As I was under the impression of media stereotypes of compulsions being entirely physical, handwashing, knocking, etc. My therapist told me they weren't sure and asked if I had ever asked chatGPT these type of questions. I told them no and they then pulled their phone out and said let's ask and go over it.

They then proceeded to read aloud the response chatGPT gave them and informed me that yes indeed you can have purely mental compulsions. We then went through some things I thought were compulsions and they kept going back and referencing the response from GPT to say it's this type of mental compulsion or this type.

The issue isn't really that my therapist didn't know the answer in the moment. I would have been fine with a ""I'm not sure let me find out and I'll get you that answer next session."". I just find it odd to suggest to me that I ask it questions about my mental health and then to use it during the session. I now feel like I won't be able to trust that anything they are saying isn't some response from it that they are regurgitating back to me. Is this any different than if they had looked it up in a book, online, or some other source?

Lastly is it justified to want a new therapist for this or am I overreacting?",1755229654.0,12,11,OCD,ocd
1mqkdt5,This disorder has ruined my life so far.,"I’ve had pretty severe ocd symptoms since I was around 8 years old, I came from a pretty chaotic and emotionally volatile environment, so my symptoms went pretty unproved. It’s also more mental although I have had physical compulsions before. My ocd has had me afraid to enjoy life, with the specific fear that something terrible, like death from an accident, cancer is waiting for me. When I was younger my ocd theme was more about identity, and my self image. I’m almost done with college and I feel like I’ve made zero social or emotional progress in life. No real new friends except for one or two, no desire to plan for my future. I can’t even enjoy a singular day. From when I wake up from when I go to sleep I believe that my horrid thoughts are coming true or that some unseen force is observing me and writing my life and that one wrong move like acknowledging my fear will cause it to come true. It’s gotten so bad id rather be asleep then do anything else. I’ve tried numerous medications and some therapy but nothing as worked. I genuinely think this is one of the worst mental health disorders if severe enough. I just don’t know how to move forward.",1755223235.0,10,3,OCD,ocd
1mqh10h,No childhood memory,"I remember nothing from my childhood or being a teenager. It’s all like in waves or things I remember from pictures or stories. I had a bad childhood. I had a traditionally great mom on the outside but to me she was cruel and mean and cold. It made me cruel and mean and cold to other people like my friends. 

Well recently the weight of the fact I was mean caught up to me. 

I get really panicky thinking and obsessing over my lack of memory- what if I did something really bad and I don’t remember and I can’t apologize? What if something really bad happened to ME by a family member and I can’t remember? What if I’m mean right now but I don’t realize it, like I didn’t realize it when I was a kid?

The fact I can’t remember is all consuming. I’m constantly scanning my mind trying to find all these hidden memories. I don’t really wanna know but it’s bothering me so bad. Badly enough where I’m just seeking constant reassurance with my friends and my throat will start to feel like it’s swelling. These horrible thoughts of things and I don’t even know if they did happen or if my OCD intrusive thoughts made them up.

I should probably clarify, I do not want to have s*x with my friends, but my brain thinks I should. Not for any good reason either. Just because I havnt done it with them before, so if I do then I can say I have and my number goes up, brain likes bigger numbers, it’s mentally satisfying. But it makes hanging out a pain when all my brain is focused on is that line of thinking. On who I can sway into it so I can have my bigger number. 

I’m also a hoarder, big numbers good, the more I have is good, it’s satisfying. Is there any way to manage this better? Or ig think about it less? 

I don’t want to sleep with my friends but I do at the same time, it’s so annoying cuz I don’t even like s*x all that much. It’s just something I do because it’s something I’ve had to do. Like a bad habit. ",1755227238.0,3,2,OCD,ocd

1mqg1hh,It's Like a Ticking Bomb,"Hey, I wouldn't consider this a crisis post, but I'm still struggling. Usually when my OCD is bad, I *know* why, and that helps me feel better because at least there's a light at the end of the tunnel; I'm in my luteal phase, a stressful life event happened recently, I broke my routine, etc. Just hold on, remember to take your meds, and it'll get better.

But recently, I jave no idea why my OCD is so bad. I just came out of my luteal phase (I have PMDD and PME too), and I usually experience a euphoria before my emotions regulate... but I'm not. I'm still experiencing anhedonia, and my OCD hasn't calmed down much at all.

Also, this year has by far been the worst OCD year yet, out of the 18 years I've suffered. My main obsession has always been the same; snapping and harming my loved ones. Now, I'm scared; what if this is a sign that my sanity is somehow running out? My OCD isn't calming down when it usually does; what if it overwhelms me, and I *do* snap? What if this year being my worst OCD year is a sign? What if it doesn't get better, and I don't even make it to the end of the year? What if what if what if?

Yes, I'm on meds, and I'm currently hunting for an ERP/ACT therapist. I'm also using an IUD to help my PMDD/PME.

I'm genuinely scared. Thinking of the future terrifies me, because my OCD catastrophizes it. Now, every day, it feels more and more like it's a fight against these harm obsessions than it has during any year in the past, and it's scary.",1755211959.0,4,2,OCD,ocd
1mqdxw8,Pretty sure my mom passed down her OCD traits/anxiety to me. Anyone else have a similar experience?,"As I (21F) get older and am moved out of the house longer, the more I realize how much anxiety my mom has. I can’t say she for sure has OCD or anxiety because she isn’t diagnosed (and will probably never be since she was raised in a third world country), but I see A LOT of similarities between us. 

As I was growing up I knew my mom was nervous and possibly a helicopter parent, but I never realized how damaging it was to me. I couldn’t go out to the front yard unless someone was watching me regardless of my age. She did everything for my siblings and I, from laundry to cooking to cleaning up and never had us do it for ourselves. She won’t sleep if she knows one of us has gone out for the night and will only go to bed once she knows we’re home safe, even though she has to wake up anywhere from 4 to 6 in the morning for work most days. She constantly makes sure all the curtains are closed and windows/doors are locked as soon as it starts getting dark out. Most recently, she’s started pushing the couch in front of the front door at night. 

This isn’t me venting or asking for advice, it’s just something I’ve started to notice more and more. A lot of things seem like potential OCD or extreme anxiety and it really shaped my own mental health as I was growing up. I definitely have my own suspicions about why she is so anxious but I can’t be 100% sure.

1mq71se,Lingering anxiety in the back of my mind,"I’m 20M and I’ve been through a lot of trauma in my life. I just recently was diagnosed with ADHD and OCD and started seeing a therapist. Which gave me the strength to end a four-year long grooming relationship with someone much older than me. Needless to say, I’m not taking it very well.

Before now, I always used to have a mostly positive outlook on life — I had anxiety and intrusive thoughts, of course, but they never felt debilitating. Like I could always distract myself or look at the positives in life, like my relationship with my family or my hobbies and interests. But now, that’s all seemed to just… go away entirely. I still find comfort in my loved ones and my interests but it just feels like there’s this dark cloud constantly over my head. Whenever I start to look up and be positive, or so much as think about my future, I’m overcome with this wave of anxiety that originates in the back of my mind, like a voice telling me “you’ll never be able to achieve a good future”. I have fears and anxiety about being a bad person, being corrupted from my groomer and my childhood abuse, and being an irredeemable person. Whenever I try to think positively, these thoughts are always playing at the back of my mind and instantly crush any positivity I feel.

What the hell can I do about this? It’s honestly debilitating. I feel that I can’t enjoy life unless it’s in the VERY immediate moment, with absolutely no consideration of the future whatsoever. Which makes it so that I feel like wanting to neglect my responsibilities like school and work. I hate feeling like this and I just want to be positive about the future but I literally can’t.

up to this point i've done a lot of work on my OCD and managed to get it to the point where it's not affecting me day-to-day. but going from having my own space to sharing with my family has really thrown me off, especially as my family home is messy with stuff on every surface which doesn't have a place to go.

1mqhhxp,pocd fears,"I’ve (21f) recently been really struggling with the theme of pocd. In February of this year is when my ocd came back in full blast- I had it as a kid (I know now that is what it was) but it was never as intense as it is now. In February it was just maybe, “the fear of ocd itself” is the best way I can describe it, so every waking second I would be checking if I had “intrusive thoughts” and just be worried and thinking about ocd. So fucking stupid. 

But maybe 3 months ago my boyfriend made a joke about me being a p, because I’m one year older than him, and I don’t know why.. but it just stuck with me. It’s at an all time high now and now the fear of ocd is still here with me but the pocd is replacing it. Here’s the part that gets me really freaked out, I have this fear of basically being alone, anytime I’m near my phone/computer, I have this thought “what if I just look up cp” and that makes me wanna just blow my brains out every-time I think of it, it makes me nervous to even go on social media, knowing at any moment I could search up things, (even though I DONOT want to) so I now have a fear of being alone in rooms/being completely alone. If there’s someone with me, I feel more comfortable, knowing I couldn’t look up anything. I have no idea how to tell my therapist this, she seems a bit judgmental honestly even though she knows about my pocd and she is a ocd therapist. I feel trapped and scared. 

One other big thing that brings me a lot of fear is masturbating(can I even say that?) Because of the strange Pocd thoughts that come up whenever I do it, everytime I do it I have these thought of Pocd and it almost seems like I don’t care about it in the moment anymore, like I don’t care about the thoughts and it’s like I want them to happen. It makes me feel sick after for days. I also finish way quicker than usual when I have thoughts of that so that is the major thing that’s making me freak out. I know a bit about gronial reactions but now I’m just wondering if this is a secret desire of mine or I’m just a flat out P. What’s strange is that I have no intrusive thoughts of boys it’s just girls, even thought I am straight. It doesn’t make sense at all and I’m utterly sick of it and OCD itself. I walk around feeling like a creep/terrible person daily and I have to pretend I’m not dying inside with other people. 

Honestly now whenever I see kids especially girls I feel enraged at the sight of them, I never liked kids but now I just detest them, it’s like they did this to me and I’m resentful. I know it’s not their fault at all but I just get so annoyed/scared at the sight of them. but I also want to run away /leave a room if I see them. I just feel a sense of dread when I see them and just want to disappear. It doesn’t help that I have a job where I have to see them daily so I just suffer silently though it. 

One solution I’m trying to accomplish lately is nofap- i hope it’ll work but lately I’ve been just failing at it since i have a high libido, like stupid high, so I usually fail in 3 days or so, and then it repeats all over again, I have intrusive thoughts during it, which I cannot stop- and then I feel more aroused(I hope it’s not real arousal??? It can’t be.) 

I swear to god- my ocd is all I think about, 24/7 365. I don’t think about it when I talk to people sometimes, or play video games, or I’m out doing something, but sometimes the thoughts are there as well. 

I can’t imagine living the rest of my life like this, I’m also not on any meds at all, maybe I should go on some? I hope I can work up the courage to talk to my therapist about the details of my pocd without getting too anxious and nervous. I just hope to god it’s Pocd at this point and not real feelings. If it was I don’t know what I would do. Thanks for reading if you made it all this way, hopefully someone’s going through something similar.

1mqhhd4,How did it go for you the first time you realised you  could have OCD?,"To put things in context, i’m 26M and over this past month I have felt like i’ve come to a realisation that I could be showing signs of moderate OCD. This has been an ongoing issue when i look back maybe since I was about 8 when I had inappropriate intrusive thoughts about my primary school teacher that made me wince and feel ill, i still remember these vivid thoughts today like recounting a movie scene in my head. I have never really known what has been wrong with me but I have been in and out of therapy numerous times with depression and anxiety but to no avail have I ever really found that i’ve felt good or moved past it. I have recently decided to start Uni, and I have access to student wellbeing support. My plan is to speak with them for the 6 sessions they provide and then go about how to speak to a GP if they feel it deems necessary. 

My questions are this, what was it like for you if this was the path you found out and what was the process like? I am concerned and worried about being taken seriously if I rush in all guns blazing with countless examples, and if I will be able to recount things in the moment as there are many I can think back on. I just want to understand how long a process something like this takes? I’m also concerned about how much I should really share regarding certain thoughts etc. There have been two times I have thought I have been dealing with different mental health conditions and my GPs have indirectly told me i’m over reacting and that it isn’t that, which has made me develop this fear to a sense of being open with them on concerns or “self-diagnosing”. When i look back i know in a sense they were correct, but since this past 4 weeks I have realised this whole time I think i’d convinced myself I had this mental health issue or that etc through what could be OCD, like a paradoxical thing i dunno lol. I’m very unsure and I just want to know how others found this process? It has been a very weird time since i’ve had this idea because I have been questioning a lot of thoughts and almost in itself became obsessed with the idea of potentially having OCD. But then going in and being told that actually I don’t and the embarrassment of that scenario mixed with the shame and being back to the drawing board is something I really cannot be bothered with, particularly now I am 26.",1755215502.0,2,4,OCD,ocd
1mqe59t,I just did my first therapy session.,"I've never been to therapy before or had any sort of help with any mental issues I've had in the past so I didn't really know what to expect and still don't know what to expect for the next session outside of my therapist (that feels a little strange to say) mentioning a suicide screening and going over the criteria for OCD to see if I met said criteria. 

Does anyone know what will happen if I do meet the criteria for OCD or what me and the therapist will work on in the future? Again I don't really know what to expect and my parent's seemed highly against me doing this in the first place (actually I've been asking for help in some way for 3 years now and this was somewhat spontaneous). 

My dad wants me to eventually pay him back for the therapy sessions. I don't really know how much I'll be paying but my parents do have insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield so I'm hopping it's not that much but my mom mentioned that the cost for the first session would be $180. I think that's without insurance coverage though? I'm not sure. 

Last thing, is it okay that the therapy I'm doing is online? My mom signed me up for therapy completely online through a platform called ""growtherapy"" which I'd never heard of before this. I remember hearing things about the platform ""betterhelp"" being a scam so I don't know if that's a red flag.",1755207553.0,3,3,OCD,ocd
1mqm5ml,any tips on how to avoid compulsions with moral/real event ocd,"basically my ocd is almost always rooted in the fear of being a bad person. every compulsion i have is extremely hard to avoid because it feels like avoiding punishment if i don’t. i do a lot of mental replaying, attempting to add meaning to thoughts (example what does this say about me?), confessing online or to my mum, lots of researching, can’t stop obsessing until i no longer feel guilty or i know i’ve been punished/it wasnt bad. basically i find it extremely hard to sit with uncertainty because i view that as being a terrible person too. like i urgently need to know whether i’m bad or not and what sort of punishment i need. i’ll also be asking my psych about this :) because whilst i would love to make living with ocd easier, i always want to do the right thing in life!!",1755228218.0,1,3,OCD,ocd
1mqm26r,I feel like I’m fucking going off the rails…,"Hi I’m 14M, please just let me yap for a little bit, sorry. 😞 

I live in a small town in the dead ass state of North Dakota. I’ve been living and going from my mom’s house to my dad’s house since I was a toddler. And even then it was so mentally exhausting. And I I’ve been diagnosed with OCD (which runs in the family), ADHD. And I also have anxiety and depression. I’ve had depression for almost I can remember to be about a year. And in the past months my ADHD and Restless Leg Syndrome had gotten so bad, more worse than my OCD. And not to mention I also get into constant fights with my mom (who I love)

When I told my Dad I feel like I had depression he said it was fine and that we would get help. But that stemmed from an argument about my grades being super shitty (because I can hardly pay attention in school, and which made me feel even more like a ugly failure) And then he just started ripping me a new asshole and anything that I told him would just make him even more mad. So eventually I just started to walk away which led to him grabbing me and dragging me and pinning me up against a wall and screaming in my face. (He does not abuse me) But when he did that it just made me feel super shitty because I am vary skinny and weak, and when he did that it just made me feel weak, useless and defenseless. 

I know this part is kinda embarrassing and stupid but… I have issues with my p#nis because I feel like it looks weird or it is going to stop working properly, or it feels numb. Probably something to do with my OCD. 

And the most recent, in the past few weeks I feel like everything is against me, even my own body and mind. My mom does not care that I have OCD and does not try to help me cope with it. And I’m pretty sure she does not believe I have depression. (Which is strange because her best friend and her brother both committed suicide one year apart from each other) She is a pretty negative person and is snappy at me. I try to not get short with her as much because I am starting to become kinda like that too, and I really just try to be as polite as possible with my awkwardness. And this night we’ve been short with each other, and I can admit I’m a little too short with her sometimes, but she is messy around are house and it makes me pissed because I hate having random junk and dirtiness around the house, so I compulsively clean to keep stuff tidy. And I accidentally spilled her water in her car and she said “I fucking hate these kids” (as some sort of joke or whatever) and it pissed me off because I already have enough negative thoughts about myself, and she’s my mom and she shouldn’t be joking like that when I’m struggling so hard. (If it even was a joke???) and she threatened to take my phone away, and my phone is the only thing holding me together. And she said if my grades are nothing but A’s or B’s she is taking it away. Which made me upset because I know I’m going to fucking suck at school because I have such a hard time paying attention. And then she just left me crying. 

I also obsess over celebrities, I have since I was like 7. And it’s also mentally draining. I just think all day about me somehow meeting them and impressing them because I envy them. The one that’s on my mind right now is Sophie Thatcher. I just relate with her because she also has OCD and body image issues.

I just feel so lonely and it’s hard for me to talk to people. I snuggle a pillow every night to pretend someone is holding me. And the negative thoughts about myself have gotten worse in the past two weeks.

I don’t know, am I just being a stupid teen?

1mqfvpw,Please give me some useful advice,"I have been having OCD since 2016. I’ve been taking medication since that year. The medication I believe helped me set my mood. The whole thing started with a depressive episode for several months. I could cry anywhere, any second, I got to the point that I was scared to stay alone.

I went to a psychologist for about 2 years maybe, which helped me calm down but I couldn’t change, I didn’t get out of the OCD circle. I also occasionally go to psychiatrist who gives me the medication.

I feel overwhelmed and stressed most of the time, I even feel this distress around my heart, I physically feel the anxiety. Now I have a very serious urge to do a compulsion but I am trying to resist. My constant fear is that the given thoughts will stay in my head forever. I think you know what I mean but it constantly in my head, as if the TV was on providing some background noise. Or as if my brain had a small part which lets these thoughts creep into my mind and stay there until I do the compulsion.

Now I feel terrible that I cannot do the compulsion (I would mentally hurt my boyfriend with that) and I fear these thoughts will stay with me.

I also do know, that if I did the compulsions now, I would calm down but eventually there would be another one to stress about. 

Do you have any advice what to do and how not to be afraid of these thoughts and just let go?

Is it necessary to attend therapy again? At the end of the day, it is me who has to change. Can you recommend some useful books, or any online material that could help?

However, from what I understand OCD builds off of already existing worldviews. So it's not a matter of separating ""bad"" beliefs from good ones.

1mqjyds,Pure O rumination OCD-how does ERP work? Greenberg?,"Hi! So I have had OCD my whole life with ""flares"" that are super intense and almost incapacitating (I suppose I get into ""freeze"" mode). My compulsion is rumination and I basically get a non-stop barrage of horrible intrusive thoughts about the many ways my loved ones can die. I'm talking the terror feelings and images wake me up and repeat on a loop for hours, it's relentless. Those are the ""flares"" that are typically triggered by stressful situations. It can last for weeks and is awful. 

My ""baseline"" is a lot of fear based thoughts that are similar but not as content and intense. For example, a friend suggests meeting up, I instantly picture us dying on the way over there. 

I've been to multiple psychiatrists and therapists. I have been on and off Lexapro or Zoloft for about 9 years. The therapist have been talking/ACT based. And really, not much has changed. So, I finally found a new therapist who specializes in in OCD and ERP, seems good so far and I'm set to start the ERP soon. 

What I can't wrap my head around is HOW ERP works when ""habituating"" or ""desensitizing"" me to my fears of my loved ones dying in gruesome and horrible ways; I mean, I have visualized it all and I don't see how doing more of that will make it stop. I

I've read Dr. Greenberg's articles which makes a lot of sense to me and I've used his advice on how to stop ruminating and just not engage with the thought, which does make sense, but also, when I'm doing that for 4-8 hours a day, is it working? 

  
I'm going to try the ERP, but don't have a lot of faith that it will work. Anyone have a similar situation, where it's all intrusive thoughts, no physical compulsions, and they just barrage me, even when I don't ""engage.""?

To be clear, I am NOT asking for a diagnosis!! Just asking about what the process of getting one has looked like for others. 

TLDR: What is the diagnostic process for OCD supposed to look like?

I am diagnosed with GAD and depression and have seen a therapist (LCSW) for the last 5 years for that. She’s mentioned “exploring OCD” to me a couple of times in the past and made it clear she was not diagnosing me with it, but it came up again more recently and we’ve been having more in depth discussions for the last month about it, but still with no official diagnosis. Is this typical? I don’t understand the diagnostic process for this, as for depression and anxiety I’ve filled out screening documents she’s sent me. 

I’m getting more concerned about getting a yes or no about OCD and getting ERP if needed due to the way my behavior/anxiety/mental health is affecting my marriage. My husband and I need help and guidance about how we’re supposed to manage this situation, if it is in fact OCD and not only my GAD as previously assumed.

Some context: 33 yr old woman, autistic (late diagnosed) but I was diagnosed with OCD very young 13-14. I am an alcoholic, sober 4 years now. One of the many forms OCD presents in my life is what in therapy has been called “moral scrupulosity” - to simplify, if I do something my brain deems immoral, I am essentially waiting for god/what have you, to punish me. Here’s where it maybe gets weird - I got sober easily. Stayed sober easily. When my “moral brain” deemed drinking as a danger (In the early stages thought the next time I drank would kill me, and honestly part of me does believe it) I stopped. I never touched anything since. I don’t have desires or cravings. Even in the low moments, or self destructive moments- I don’t think about alcohol. Lately I’ve been feeling immense guilt after watching a friend struggle to get clean. I feel terrible that I can’t relate. I often feel guilty for the fact that while OCD is often debilitating for me in many ways that prevent me from being “normal,” it arguably also saved my life. 

Hoping someone, anyone can relate.

1mqj8qh,OCD and soul,"Right now I feel terrible and anxious. I said something that in the end turned out to be some type of ERP. Let me explain you my intrusive doubts and how I am managing them. 

 I was praying to God for forgiveness of a sin I made. My head was telling me God will not forgive me and that I was doomed.  Just before finishing it, due to the distress, a horrible image2 came into my mind, that a ""demon"" was taking my ""soul"". It was quite distressing and felt real. So I went to pray and told ""Ignore those thoughts, they don't represent me"". However my OCD told I had to go yonder, so I relaxed and said ""because I give my soul to God, Mary and Jesus"" multiple times. Then, said ""I commit my soul to God, Mary and Jesus"" and at the end ""In the hands of God I commit my soul"". It was a distressing moment filled with a lot of anxiety. Normally I rehearse what I say before prayer, just to make sure everything is ""perfect"" but this just came out. 

So here are the following thoughts that have been distressing me and how I answer to them:

\- You don't know God well. You gave your soul to a false distorted image of God: 

God knows my heart, that I'm imperfect and cannot understand everything. I did it out of fear and faith thinking in the love, protection and tenderness of God.

\- The ""demon"" you saw acted in your weakness and you gave your soul:

Having faith in God, the name of God and the act of crossing yourself is more than enough to cast away any ""demon"".

\- You did it out of fear and for your salvation, not because you truly loved God. It was a compulsion:

Maybe, but God knows my disease, weakness and understands it. I asked for his forgiveness and to help me become a better person.

\- You accidentally gave your soul to Satan:

You can not do that because all souls belong to God. Even, doing such bargain would require being 100% aware of it, which is clearly not what my heart wanted (we clearly know such bargain is biblically impossible)

It's been quite hard fighting all these thoughts and had some sleep issues. I am currently working with a psychiatrist to treat this. 

This event turned out to be some type of ERP because I did something out of fate that is very distressing. So basically, most intrusive thoughts from other topics have almost disappeared except for the mental dread of the event.

But, every time I make a mistake, or something is brought to my attention, it sends me down a spiral of immediately thinking I will be fired, that everyone in my workplace hates me or is out to get me, or things of that nature. I’ve been fixated on this thought since before any discussion was even brought up about it, I don’t know what even triggered it. It’s just this looming feeling of impending doom. 

There was an event today where I accidentally threw out product (box felt empty, didn’t double check) and some kind of action does have to be taken, and i’m trying so hard to take it in stride as I know it was an honest mistake and there just has to be some kind of record since it was money lost. But all the progress i’ve made to try and feel comfortable in my job, and not constantly checking for some sign that I am or am not “good” at my job or evidence that I will or will not be fired, is quickly dismantling itself because of this. 

I’m unfortunately, not in therapy, I’m working on it but in the meantime?? I have no idea what to do to stop myself from spiraling and making my performance at work even worse as a side effect. It feels like this is just how i’m going to feel forever until I inevitably DO lose my job. ",1755217521.0,1,0,OCD,ocd

1mqhbqb,Do you guys experience this?,"Given that I'm still young and trying to become financially independent, I would like to seek professional help as soon as possible; however, I find it helpful to learn as much as I can about my experience in the meantime. I would have never entertained the idea of having OCD in addition to undiagnosed, yet undoubtedly severe MDD.

One summer before I entered high school, I experienced a sea of voices in my head urging me to harm myself. I've always had issues with rumination, but this time it was different, because I genuinely felt like other people's voices were inside my head, and I could hear my voice amongst all of them. I couldn't stop them, and it lasted for about 20 seconds, but it felt like forever. Furthermore, I felt my head tighten and a ""throbbing"" sensation, if that makes sense.

A few weeks later, I became hyperreligious. Long story short, I threw out anything in the house that would be considered ""sinful"" by the bible—something my mother slightly resents me for—including colored candles, amulets, crystals, bacon, secular films, etc. I was sure all my suffering was caused by demonic oppression, and I was desperate to liberate myself as well as my loved ones. As I began to pick up the habit of prayer and repentance, I began to have uncontrollable thoughts about blaspheming God and praising ""Satan."" These thoughts gradually intensified to horrific images of violence and sexual perversions (Ex, Pedophilia and Bestiality), which created a vicious cycle of shame and repentance. I used to get on my knees and repent—or silently in my head when I was in public—at least 15 times a day. The more I tried to push the thoughts away, the stronger they would retaliate.

This lasted for about a year until these thoughts began to diminish along with my hyperreligious faith. I've never told anyone about this because I felt crazy and ashamed for being a ""sick"" human being. Looking back at these moments, as my brain chemistry has naturally and temporarily stabilized, I've noticed that those intrusive thoughts seem to be aligned with those of OCD. However, I've never really had the compulsions associated with OCD, such as needing to eat a specific number of macaroni at once, washing my hands 10 times, or needing to turn the doorknob three times.

To those diagnosed with OCD, could it be an indicator of OCD, or does it sound like something else?

Edit: I haven't really had these types of thoughts since. Once in a while, I do get suicidal thoughts, but they do not compare to my previous obsessions.

I always thought ""well, I guess that means I'm just a really guilty and anxious"" and never really put more thought into it.

I certainly never expected these could be from OCD because my only exposure to OCD was reorganizing things and frequently washing yourself and surfaces, the ""funny"" OCD in tv and movies (and that stupid CDO tee shirt). Hell, all the intrusive thoughts memes made me think intrusive thoughts needed to be actionable since they're something ""you let win"".

I end up feeling guilty after eating more than I actually want, but the cycle continues.

And I don’t feel like my ocd is valid because im not underweight. In my head if im underweight and frail it proves that im not capable of the horrible things i fear, but being overweight is a indicator that im disgusting and capable of bad things because i eat i ‘must want my body to be strong enough to hurt people’.

It may have been other characteristics that I enjoyed and not necessarily the kink at hand but even if that's true, I fantasized and looked at pornography of something extremely extremely taboo.

It's like I feel like a toddler and don't trust myself with the way I do things, like somehow what I've been doing is actually wrong and I need to see how other people do things. Like nothing comes natural and I'm learning to be human. Like basic function things.

I'm also hyperfocusing on my body in general, especially body hair, especially pubic hair, and how I can't shave correctly, won't wear shorts because of fear of pubic/leg hair showing. I have this weird perfectionism with myself which I think is a lot of body dysmorphia, I think my body image is the worst thing for me and unless I fit myself to the standards i have for myself, until I do x y and z I can't like myself, can't wear certain clothes, I won't wear my hair up a lot bc I'm scared the way I did it is stupid/isn't the right way to do it and people will think I'm stupid.

Im very much a grown adult but I still live at home and my mom always washes the laundry and cooks, she made all of my appts until I was 22, its like they didnt really teach me how to do things but expected me to pick up on/eventually start doing them myself but unless I'm explicitly told how to do things, its hard for me.

1mqddj2,Living With a Sibling Who a Glass Contamination OCD,"My sibling has severe OCD, mostly focused on contamination fears related to glass. Their routines and rules are very specific and rigid. For example, they avoid going into their own bed if they’re wearing outside clothes, as they consider it contaminated, and they won’t touch doors without going through a complicated hand-washing ritual. Sometimes this means even washing their hands after touching the *top* of a room door,  they often kick the door open to avoid the lower part, which they feel is contaminated from shoes.

They often buy new clothes rather than wearing ones they’ve already used, and some family members, including one of our parents, who are considered “contaminated.” They won’t sit in our parent’s car because they believe it became “infected” about two years ago, when another sibling picked up glass at a soccer game and then drove the car home, touching the steering wheel. Because our parent drives that car, they are also considered contaminated, and so are the car keys.

Their fears have been so strong that after surgery, they wouldn’t accept our parent’s help to lift them or assist them around the house, even though they clearly needed physical support. I know how exhausting it must be for them to try to avoid what they fear all day, and how much mental energy it takes to keep up with these rules. They also avoid areas of the house that our parent’s belongings have touched and are even careful near windows, fearing glass particles could spread. They frequently wash their phone and take care not to let objects touch their things, as otherwise those items will be seen as contaminated.

I know these fears feel incredibly real and distressing for them, and I try to keep that in mind. At the same time, it can be challenging to live with because if someone doesn’t follow their rules, even unknowingly, they may become upset, raise their voice, or curse out of frustration. Sometimes they ask others to open doors for them, and if we don’t, they react strongly. I understand that in those moments, it’s probably the anxiety talking. But can still be very stressful for me.

I want to be understanding and supportive. But I also find myself feeling stressed and anxious, constantly worried about breaking a rule or upsetting them. I’m looking for advice on whether these behaviors are considered extreme or not , and how others have managed living with a loved one who has such intense contamination fears without making things harder for them or for yourself.",1755205835.0,1,0,OCD,ocd

1mpxy5k,Thoughts about the Afterlife bothering me…,"**\*\*\*\*Trigger Warning for Existentialism/Nihilism, Religious, and Death related OCD\*\*\*\***



I randomly had the thought of, “If when a life passes away, why is it sad if it’s now going to the Afterlife, which is a paradise?” 

Because I’m having trouble of rationalizing this thought, I worry about devaluing life and losing my empathy when any life passes away. Also, while I’m not super Religious I want to believe in the Afterlife.

I don’t remember how I used to think about it, but I just wish I could have a way of thinking about it that helps me get over it. The fact that I‘m having trouble rationalizing something that should be so simple makes me feel like I’m a sociopath. While I know on some level that this is all my OCD, it’s still very difficult to overcome this thought. 

A response I’ve read online said, “It’s because people are still uncertain that there is an Afterlife. That’s why people get sad.” But some of my thoughts about that are, “What about if you do fully believe in the Afterlife? And in various forms of media (TV, books, etc.) the Afterlife would be known to exist, but people would still get sad at a character dying.”

And another response I’ve read online when talking about why ‘losing a loved one is still sad when you know they’re going to the Afterlife’ was, “It’s sad because it’s a parting with someone that you won’t be able to see again for a long time.” But my thoughts to that response are, “What about lives that pass away that you have no connection to? And besides people you don’t know, what about all life in general? Such as, all the animals, bugs, etc.? And why would it still be sad to part with someone, even if it’s many decades later until you’re reunited with them, when that person is now in the Afterlife which is a paradise? What would be the difference to someone you know moving away long distance?”

I also will have the thought, “Whatever happens to any life, no matter how sad or horrible, doesn’t matter because they’ll end up in the Afterlife which is a paradise.” So, I worry that I will now begin to devalue life in general and what happens to any life.

I just feel gross and insensitive to even writing all this out. I hope I didn’t upset anyone reading all of this…

I don’t want to lose my ability to be sad at when any life passes away; even a bug. And I also don’t want to devalue life and think that life itself doesn’t matter.

I was recently prescribed lexapro (5mg) for my anxiety after explaining to my doctor the thoughts I had. This was about a month and a half ago.

Problem is, I came across an issue after getting it prescribed. Initially, I was so happy to have a medication to help. But…as soon as I got home.. the intrusive thoughts began. Basically, I psyched myself out, thought that I was going to have all of the bad side effects that were listed. It got to a point that the thoughts told me I would have a manic episode or a psychotic break if I took them.

So for the last month and a half they’ve been sitting there. I talked to my therapist a bit about them but I didn’t tell her the extent of my thoughts bc honestly I couldn’t even really put them into words.  

Last night, I had a talk with my sister and mustered up the courage to take one. I panicked a little right before and almost gave up but I did it. And guess what! I feel great. Nothing crazy. Literally not much different than normal life. I got a little hot at first but that was it.

I have a doc appt today to discuss it with my doctor. She’s thinking I’ve been on them. And now I have to explain it to her.

1mq0t8q,Trapped in a loop of weird urges my mind makes up- How do you manage this?,"I'm experiencing urges to do repetitive movements, and if I don't act on them, I get a buildup of uncomfortable tension that is only relieved by doing whatever movement or movements my mind currently fixates on. 

Since childhood, I've often had urges to hit my ankles while walking and to blink excessively, though I managed to supress it more easily in public even if the blinking urge usually flared up.
When I was 11, my mom took me to an eye doctor twice because she noticed the excessive blinking, and we always left with prescribed eyedrops even though my eyes weren't really dry. There was also a period when I would inhale deeply until I got a sharp feeling in my chest, hold it, and then repeat it. It was very uncomfortable, but I was highly aware of the sensation afterward which led me to repeat the behavior in loop as I remained focused on the sensation until I repeated it again. Thankfully that went away. There were definitely more urges that I don't remember now. 

The ankle hitting stayed, but it wasn't that annoying. I’ve just finished high school, and during that time, my urge for repetitive movements flared up again. The excessive blinking came back, and new urges appeared: stretching or cracking my neck, rolling my ankle to the side while standing (I once fell in a store while doing it in heels), making facial expressions using only my eyebrows, and more.
Recently, these urges have flared up again, and I’m sure it’s related to anxiety. I plan to buy a stress ball or something, and I’m seriously considering taping my face if I get the urge to move my eyebrows again, since I anxiously overthink about getting wrinkles that could’ve been avoided.

First, I joined the internet very early, like 6-7 years old, and I started using it on my own when I was 10. Anyway, when I was 11, I was a victim and received a video with... criminal content. I watched the video and reacted to it. When I finished, I automatically regretted it and deleted the video. I quickly forgot about that video. The person who sent me this video was my ex-boyfriend who was like 4 years older than me, he made me do horrible things, made me sexualize myself, got me addicted to pornography and... other things. I broke up with him a long time ago and also stopped talking to him when I realized what had happened. 

Now, I believe these thoughts started at 12, the first one was when I had to help my friend's little sister put on some clothes and I felt strange, I can't explain it, I don't know if it was discomfort or something else, btw, I forgot quickly too.

When I was 13-14, I thought ""Am I a P?"" around my little cousin, I felt embarrassed and started avoiding her and went home, I also quickly forgot about it too.

When I was 17, which happened this year, at my college (while I was still there) there were always children visiting, I only noticed their presence and then ignored it, the most that happened was the desire to interact, or to run away. When I went to an anime event, I saw a child dressed as Snow White and I thought it was cute, but soon after I thought it was something inappropriate and ignored it, at the same event there was another child with shorter clothes, I felt uncomfortable, I looked away, I'm afraid to look, I deleted all the photos of the event because of this too.

I've never liked children or babies. I find them annoying and unpleasant. I've never had unpleasant images in my head, just a bad feeling. I've always fantasized about older people or people my own age, and I've never thought about these criminal toughts without a trigger. I cried watching Hope, I cried when they tried to kill the baby in Round 6. I don't know, it's confusing, it scares me, I'm terrified. I keep creating images in my head, and it seems pleasant, but I don't want that. I'm scared. I started to notice that I don't get disgusted by the thoughts anymore and it scares me, I feel like I'm having false memories, children seem too beautiful in my head now, I just want all this to end, I don't want to be like this, I'd rather die than be a P, I keep imagining that ""in certain scenarios I would react or would want to react"", I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.",1755172085.0,5,10,OCD,ocd

She has had OCD symptoms for as long as I can remember but has always refused help. About 7 years ago it became really bad.

She developed a really bad asbestos contamination fear after we had a new floor installed. There was no asbestos found but but no amount of reassurance helped.
She started cleaning frantically. And hasn't stopped the past 7 years.

It fluctuates she has better and worse times. But the past months it's gotten bad enough that she finally accepted that she needs help when the asbestos fear evolved into a fear of every and all dust. I am super proud of her for getting help. She started talking to a counsellor and is on the wait list for a psychologist. She takes antidepressants that help take the edge of for her but it's still really difficult.

I've noticed that the past few months all we talk about is her OCD. I'm glad she is talking to someone but I feel like the actuals OCD has only gotten worse. She tapes down my doors now to avoid dust entering through the cracks. A lot of my clothes are packed in bags and are not to be used. She washes everything by hand because the washer is contaminated for her. She's now washing all my old toys in a little tub in the backyard with a toothbrush to get out the dust.

I was officially diagnosed last year, and it didn't help me feel relief like I thought it would. I do feel like my thoughts have been less intense over this year, but now looking back, I'm really terrified that I don't have ocd. I know this is something people feel often, but is it a possibility I've read other people's symptoms and my brain wants me to have ocd, so I've convinced myself I deal with these things? I practice conversations aloud (past and future), is it possible I rewrote my own memories and nothing. actually has happened the way I remember? I'm not currently in therapy (insurance issues), but I'm also so scared to start with an ocd specialist if I've been lying to myself and the doctor who diagnosed me. I've made lists of each thing I've struggled with, but now I don't want to read from the list to my doctor because I'm nervous he'll think I wrote down other people's symptoms and I'm using those to convince him they're my own. honestly I don't know, I feel like I'm going crazy. just thinking ""maybe I have ocd"" or ""maybe I lied about everything"" I feel physically ill and so alone.

1mq85fz,Medication recommendations?,"Hello! 

This year I was diagnosed with OCD. Recently, I've gone through a lot of transition and I feel like there are stressors coming at me from pretty much every direction of my life, and my anxiety levels have been through the roof to a degree that I haven't felt in about 10 years when I was in middle school (I'm 22). I've always had some level of anxiety, but it comes in waves of intensity depending on what's going on in my life, and right now it feels constant. As an adult, it feels like it's directly holding me back from feeling confident in career prospects and social situations. OCD spirals/ruminations have been intense and have become such a thief of time and happiness. I spend SO much of my free time trying to calm down from my stressful job or redirect away from a compulsion as a response to stress, often unsuccessfully and I end up dissociating—both take hours of my day, leaving me with little time to properly truly relax. It affects at-home dynamics with my partner, I don't feel like myself anymore, and my self-esteem has been so low because of it.

I have never been on anxiety medication. I have ADHD and I was on Adderall for about 9 years starting in elementary school, and briefly on Ritalin for a couple of months, and then I stopped and haven't been on anything else, which was almost 5 years ago now. I've always had reservations about trying anxiety or depression medication because the trial and error period of figuring out what works for you sounds scary to me. I want to still feel like myself and I don't want it to cause insomnia or hypersomnia issues. 

I know it's different for everyone, but if anyone with OCD who tried anxiety medication for the first time later in life has any positive experiences with specific meds and could share that, that would be great. 

I am discussing this with my therapist and PCP as well, I'm just hoping to get some insight from personal experiences, as only a couple of people close to me in my life have been on medication so I don't have a good frame of reference and I don't know a lot about anxiety meds in general aside from horror stories.",1755194506.0,1,6,OCD,ocd

I will not go into specifics, so there’s no triggers in this. If I say something that is accidentally a trigger or not allowed, please correct me!  

I always had these “quirks” and “rules” that drove people insane. It makes dating and friendships incredibly hard. Coupled with PTSD, life has been rough to say the least. I’m sure yall can relate.  

People would always say “you’re so OCD!” because of my issues with contamination. I knew OCD is a serious mental illness that wasn’t to be taken lightly. I never considered that I ACTUALLY had it, because I believed that my contamination fears were so stereotypical that it just COULDNT be OCD. I don’t know if that makes any sense? People throw this diagnosis around so lightly, I thought they were all wrong.   

Fast forward to years later, I read an article on a website about OCD that described my EXACT obsessions and compulsions. I couldn’t believe it. I have a “clean” world, and I had never heard of anyone else having that until I read this article.  

It was very emotional for me to read this article describing my exact experiences. I felt sad because who wants OCD!? But I also felt happy because if there’s a diagnosis for what I have, it can be treated. 

Here I am, a few months into having my diagnosis from my psychiatrist, and now I am receiving treatment. I feel hopeful and I think my compulsions are easing up a bit!   

Can any of yall relate to resisting the diagnosis due to not wanting to take it lightly? I’m also interested to hear if any of yall have a clean world?

Then I feel like shit, feel stuck (physically), shame myself, and the cycle continues. 

Another ex: Lots of anxiety surrounding relationships in general. Trying to interpret everything my MIL is doing or saying constantly. Always feeling very defensive. When I meet other peers, enjoying the time spent but then going back through the interactions. If it wasn’t perfect or felt a little off, I decide I don’t want to be friends or have no desire to make an effort again (even though maybe I enjoyed my time overall).

However it did absolutely NOTHING about intrusive thoughts (which in my case are pretty severe) and I live in a constant fog of my own thoughts.

- Start taking clomipramine+ sertraline. Her points: Clomipramine is an older medication, has more side effects, however it is ""more effective"" against intrusive thoughts.

- Start taking risperidone+ sertralina. Her points: Risperidone has less side effects, but is less effective against intrusive thoughts.

I chose to try clomipramine first, as I've read lots of successes in this sub from people who took it due to severe intrusive thoughts, but I'd like to hear from people who tried risperidone or other antipsychotics - as I might end switching up if I have too many side effects.",1755187339.0,1,4,OCD,ocd
1mpuslq,"Medication side effects and risks, are any of you taking healthy/healthier alternatives?","Hi. 😊

To provide some information:

I'm Anxiety disorder, OCD and Depression diagnosed (as of 2019).

I was out on Resperidon (about 1 to 2mg) and Serrapress.

Over the years, I've noticed various possible side effects and risks associated with taking such medication (especially Resperidon as a antipsychotic) based on my studies and research (I have 2 degrees in Psychology).

These symptoms include:

Rapid weight gain, increased blood pressure and heart rate, lack of sexual driven, being under entrance and unmotivated (procrastination), lack of interest in doing tasks, nausea, hunger cravings and food noise, sugar cravings, loss of some personality and energy, tiredness and other symptoms, more severe when I haven't taken my medication for a few days for some reason or another (withdrawal).

It has severely affected my mental and physical health and I am so so worried, especially about the latter.

I want to first acknowledge and state that I will of course be seeking to work with a psychiatrist and mental health professional, I come here just for suggestions and advice for people who have experienced similar symptoms and will then speak to the professional about them so I can slowly change over and get into something healthier for my mind and body.

I'm looking for the following:

Natural herbs, teas or vitamins etc I could take that have similar positives that an antipsychotic would have.

Natural and healthy lifestyle habits that have helped you manage your mental and physical health, especially after taking such strong medications.

General advice over management of the same disorders I have been diagnosed with.

I have done much research and study over the above, and have spoken with professionals before, but I have little to no experience talking to others with a similar diagnosis or who have managed their mental and physical health in such a way that has helped them with both.

Again, I want to stipulate that I will be taking some of these suggestions to a professional and will be working with them.

And to also warn against using practises suggested online without the aid and guidance of a professional.

I come here merely for additional research and suggestions and firsthand experience to help me along my journey when I'm seeing someone.

I thank you for your time and I wish you all well- mental health and it's side effects can be difficult, so know you aren't alone in it's experiences.

1mpy2vj,OCD and its similarities with Murphy’s (Sod’s) Law,"Murphy’s Law, or Sod’s Law for all my fellow Brits, is somewhat of a Universal Law that holds the premise of ‘If it can go wrong, it will go wrong’. ‘If I do x, y is bound to happen’, ‘Of course it did’ etc.

Lately, I cannot help but think about how much the fear of said law can play a huge part in OCD or at least, there are many similarities. Many of us here with OCD don’t / do perform certain mental or physical compulsions to avoid the worse case scenario happening.   
We all have subtypes of OCD. One of mine being False Memory. We can have one subtype or a handful. Though I feel there is a common denominator in ‘If I do x, y will happen’, and it can be something unrelated.

I bring this up because of something that happened to me just now. I‘m going to write in my diary about my latest worry so I can calm myself and realise how silly OCD is being and jump another hurdle. However, I had a strange feeling of ‘You only have a pen with Red Ink, if you write with red ink, you will have bad luck and all of your worst fears will become a reality’. I contemplated about this for a bit, and I’m going to use the red inked pen to write as a part of exposure.

I'm 22 years old and I've been diagnosed at 18 years old with severe depression. Since then I went to therapy but due to my depression and many things involved in my life I stopped going in early 2024, even though I still take medications for depression but it is not enough and I'm not personally followed by my psychiatrist since early this year (I know I should contact him but I live far away and I prefer personal contact when I'm talking about my struggles).

I know the easy answer: go again. 

But since my parents (I live with my dad) don't have much money for therapy (even when I risked doing something *big* they still don't believe in therapy) I started working . But here's the catch:

I'm still in University and I need to finish my last 4 exams. Here where I live there's no minimum wage law for people that work, I roughly get 500 euros per month with 6 hours of work, which for what it needs me it isn't enough.

This is causing me so much stress: work to do, finish the exams, my parents (especially my mother) judging me and telling me I always do nothing and degrading me verbally h24, everything it's making me go in burnout.

Then it adds the hot weather which causes me to feel always angry and tired.

It's been 2 years since I wanted ro get better, but whatever I do, whatever I try it's never enough to be indipendent and ""free"".

I secretly thought I was just sinful or a bad apple. In no way do I support these intrusive thoughts whatsoever, they just pop into my head and I feel guilty for even thinking that way. My intrusive thoughts mainly involve catastrophes with my loved ones to taboo topics like incest. 

I felt absolutely disgusted with myself for even having that in my mind, to the point where it’s driven me into a crippling state. It makes me feel better that there are people out there who feel the same. It gave me the confidence to finally accept help.

This is when I decided to go to my primary care doctor. I told her how I had concerns about OCD. Not the cute “I like a clean house” but more if I can’t protect and control my loved ones I will panic. I first told her about the catastrophic intrusive thoughts, but she didn’t seem to be too sure that I had OCD. I told her I wasn’t comfortable talking about the other things with her, but she kept pushing. So, I decided to admit the darker side of my intrusive thoughts. After verbalizing it, I thought I would have this immense relief, but no. I immediately wanted to take the words back and felt so embarrassed. That I could never see that professional again. She tried to understand, I can tell, but she couldn’t. As much as she tried not to be judgmental, I felt it. I wish I had just kept quiet and waited for a psychiatric referral.

I genuinely feel like throwing up because today was a mess and I was not only still stuck on the fourth section of the book, but I realized belatedly today is the 13th. Now I’ve spiraled with, “great and I’m stuck on the 13th chapter and tomorrow is the 14th.” 

Even so I’m just going to do my best to ignore this and go to sleep. I’m just beyond myself with how I’m supposed to not think or feel this way. (I’m going to try and talk with my therapist tomorrow about this and hopefully it’s a good session even for being on the 14th.) We’ve been focusing so much on me staying afloat during chaos and trying to touch on parts work for C-PTSD, but I’m at this point where I’m wondering if I need to shift to OCD. It’s hard to believe anything can fix this kind of thinking.

but, i’ve been sure that i will not interact with anyone under 16 when i’m 18, anyone under 17 when i’m 20, and anyone under 18 when i’m 21. just for comfort reasons. i made this comment in another subreddit and got called ageist, but, it’s just i feel a boundary for me so i feel secure. obviously i’m not gonna refuse to talk to a teen IRL, because i’ll be surrounded by other people and there’s no real reason for my thoughts to really get to me, and i have no intentions of being friends with a child when i become an adult, it’s just online. because kids get groomed (i’ve been groomed lmao) by adults and older teens all the time online so, it’s just a boundary i have for my own sake. 

even now i wont interact with anyone under 15 just because of my fears.

I talked to a pharmacist and they said that 3 days is not enough time to say that the medication stopped working as it would have happened gradually… not all at once but it’s hard to not look on here and see horror stories

I will say I feel better than I did before medication even during this bad week, the lows are not as low as they would have been once (of course I keep thinking it will get worse and worse) - I guess I just thought it would never come back or I was permanently cured…

(Or at least when the UV index is above 3 but like that’s still way more often than I was taught growing up.) My OCD has taken this topic and *ran* with it, but since sunscreen is actually important, it’s very difficult for my brain to know when my fears are realistic and when they’ve been blown out of proportion.

For example, today I was rushing in the morning cuz I was going to be late for an appointment, so I didn’t put on sunscreen before I left. While I was out, I spent around 45 minutes outside (I tried to stay in the shade for the vast majority of the time). I was so worried and then when I got home I had a panic attack haha fun. I use sunscreen literally every other time I go outside nowadays, but my brain is so scared what if these 45 minutes have done horrible damage to me and it’s difficult for my thoughts to move on.

Don’t worry, I’m not looking for reassurance, I just mostly want advice if anyone knows how I can improve my OCD symptoms related to this?? It’s been difficult for me to do my usual exposure therapy strategies because like… it *is* actually important to wear sunscreen. So I don’t know.

EDIT: I just realized this is scaring me so much because (again since I was rushing this morning) I didn’t eat breakfast!!! I’ve barely eaten today!! I *always* get worse OCD symptoms when I don’t eat enough! Haha I hope everyone else here remembers to eat enough as well.",1755118658.0,6,8,OCD,ocd

I have been afraid of bugs for most of my life and grew up with a phobia of spiders. However, when I moved to a new city it changed to deep phobia of cockroaches. This was onset by living in an apt infested with them. I moved to a new apt two years ago where I thought I would be more comfortable, but lately I have had the looming fear that they are all around me. And not just roaches, just the general idea of bugs. I feel like they’re always crawling on me everywhere I go, especially at night in my bed. At work is bad bc there are roaches in the gym restrooms so i constantly feel bugs crawling all around me and on me when im at my desk. Every single room I step in I am constantly scanning the floors and walls and I cannot step barefoot any where for the fear of stepping on a bug. And if I let myself think about it, I’ll become obsessed with the idea that they’ll fall from the ceiling in dark rooms where I can’t see them. For a while i stopped eating out bc i was worried that the kitchens had bugs and that they would crawl in my food. Drinking out of cans and non-clear cups scares me. I can’t wear my hair down bc im scared they’ll get in my hair and I won’t know. This weekend my skin was touching fabric movie seats and I felt like everything single microorganism was on my skin and that I could feel them moving. And my worst fear came true when I saw two roaches in my new apt in the last two weeks. I don’t know what to do. It’s consuming every single minute of my life and I wish I could just hypnotize myself out of this fear. I don’t know what to do or where to start. ",1755146705.0,1,0,OCD,ocd
1mpeu1t,"My partner with OCD gets angry/overreacts at small things and while I think it may be because of OCD, I don't know what to do","I'm still trying to learn how to navigate being in a relationship with someone with OCD. He's mostly very sweet, caring and loving. However, sometimes when a situation does not go as planned, for example, I go about my day sometimes not really having a plan or not being able to think about the things I have to do for the rest of the day until I can finish the current thing occupying all my brainpower. I'm trying to be vague as to not post something that he might stumble upon if he uses this website.

Essentially, if one thing takes longer than expected or a sudden task appears that will take significant time and effort that neither of us were expecting, while I react to it neutrally and something that we just have to figure out how to handle, he freaks out but more in the form of anger rather than anxiety. He'll start backtracking on everything we did throughout the day that was kind of done on a whim, say how we shouldn't have stopped for coffee, then start picking on the things that I could have done better. The last time this happened a couple of days ago he took a lot of my duties onto his plate to make my day easier (I was expecting a friend) but when something went wrong due to both of our errors that caused him to have to put a lot more time that he wasn't expecting to have to put into it, he started picking apart how I wasn't efficient with my time and how I didn't plan well, even though nothing would have come up if this one hiccup didn't happen. I check in with him a lot and thank him a lot for doing things like that for me, but if one thing goes wrong while he is doing something for me that i tell him he really does not have to do, he loses it and blames it on me.

I tell my friends about this and they say he's immature and should be working with me as a team instead of placing all the blame on me when things go wrong but I can't help but think this might stem from his OCD. But I don't know what to accept or how to go about it or what realistically could be done differently to stop this from happening. Any advice helps. I'm thinking about how I will likely have to figure out how to gently tell him to stop doing so much for me, but I don't know if that's the issue

i started shoving tissues inside my vagina to wipe off all of the fluids after sex because i only feel clean when i am dry down there. this caused a lot of open wounds in my labia because i was wiping too vigorously however i prefer to be in pain than be dirty.

I will preface this by saying that I have NOT been formally diagnosed with OCD as my doctors are useless and have not referred me to a psychiatrist but I did have a high score on the OCI and thus was eligible for OCD therapy which has helped immensely. Anyway, I had been struggling with certain themes all my life and since I was 16 (about 7 years ago now) struggled to do some pretty “basic” things due to my anxiety. In late 2022 however I fell into a deep spiral where I became extremely depressed and anxious and because of my obsessions became extremely guilty and afraid constantly. I ended up taking some pretty drastic measures to remove myself from people so I didn’t harm anyone (blocking all of my friends, changing my number, changing my email, deleting social media’s etc) and to be honest every day felt like hell to me. I couldn’t even see someone in the street and smile at them without wondering what it meant. I couldn’t touch people if they asked me to help put their coat on for example. I couldn’t game with people online without feeling extreme anxiety. Throughout this, I stayed in my relationship although I was seeking reassurance from my partner every day until it strongly impacted our relationship. Again I won’t go into details and this might not be the right wording but I genuinely felt I was losing my sanity as the thoughts I were having were so distressing and I couldn’t tell what was real and what was intrusive. I also ended up having sessions with a specialist for people that harm others as I thought I was a harm to other people and was so afraid, although they discharged me after a few months as they didn’t believe I would harm anyone. This year after going to OCD therapy for almost a year, Ive finally started to heal. I can sit next to people on the train again, I can work with customers again, I can control my fears again, I can have relationships again with friends and family. Now I look back and I almost hate how I feel now. I don’t understand how I could’ve been so in my head then and now I’m just … back to normal. It makes me question if it was even real. Now for the most part I can clearly tell I do not want to harm anybody, and the reason I took those drastic actions was because I so didn’t want to. I just don’t understand how I was going through all of that and now I’m just fine? Sorry for rambling, I’ve never really said all of this before except to my therapist.

Why are you diagnosed with OCD? Let’s see how vast this spectrum is.

I’ll start. I have OCD because I have obsessive violent thoughts. That’s about it really. Maybe I have other symptoms that I am not aware of yet but the violent thoughts are why I’m diagnosed. Prozac zaps them away though and I’m fine. Just got out of involuntary hospitalization actually because I refused meds so they made me go back on them.

The results came back in March, about 2 weeks after the test concluded. My doctor told me it was all ""normal"", and - despite my frustration - I accepted this and moved on. Completely forgetting that I can (and should) request a copy of the report.

Today I did so, and after looking through it and studying up a bit, I'm floored. I did get a referral to a cardiologist from the doctor, and it isn't like I have A-Fib or an abnormal number of VEs or anything, but two of the events made my jaw drop; because WHAT DO YOU MEAN  I mentioned POTS as a concern to you and you looked at an event at 5:24 PM of 100 bpm with the note ""stood up too fast"" and the next at 5:25 PM of 133 bpm and didn't think to say anything to me???

The section on the front of the report where the cardio was meant to put in ""final interpretation"" just looks like it has initials scribbled in. My heart rate jumped to 189 bpm in the middle of an hour straight of above 120 bpm readings on the second night (I think I was bringing small boxes of items into my office and arranging them??) and was regularly above 100 while I was seated. The entries from times I was sleeping were at 70 or above. I told her I hadn't been exercising during the test as I've been dealing with fatigue and her eyes got so wide.

So now I guess I'm making an extensive list of symptoms I think are related to dysautonomia to take with me to the cardiologist, but holy shit is it hard to resist going on the Google Hell-spiral of symptoms and anecdotal posts I would regularly spend 4+ hours on. Consider my flabbers gasted. ",1755135200.0,1,1,OCD,ocd
1mpmvrt,advice please - ROCD?,"hi all! i’ve been struggling with OCD for most of my life and work on it in therapy, however i have (semi)recently noticed some new obsessions in regard to my relationship. i have experienced them before but i honestly just want to hear from other people about it. what works for you? do you experience this too? etc. basically the obsession is that no matter what i do in my relationship i am actively ruining it. it mostly manifests in communication. for example, im feeling down and have just had a not-so-great day. if i tell my boyfriend about these negative feelings, he will grow to resent me and find me burdensome. if i don’t tell him, the same outcome will occur. i hope this makes sense to someone out there. i feel like in almost every situation i have this unbearable and overwhelming feeling of no matter what i do or don’t do my boyfriend is growing resentful of me over time and is going to leave me. it’s this feeling of “i can’t do or say this because if i do then this horrible thing will happen.” but at the same time i want to communicate and be open so ill over correct and share how i feel but then immediately regret it because i’ve just committed myself to the aforementioned terrible outcome. the compulsion side of this is to check in so incessantly. i know how annoying that is, and i also think that these not-so-subtle check ins for reassurance are also leading my boyfriend to grow tired of me. this is so hard to explain so i hope it makes sense. of course i discuss with my therapist and that does give me some short term relief, but it’s almost like a relapse a few days after or the next time i find myself stressed or anxious or anything that causes me to spiral a little bit. any advice or comments welcome.

1mpfhty,What to do when OCD cycles become subconscious?,"I’ve had OCD (sexuality-related) for years now and over the past year I’ve finally been trying to treat it properly with exposure exercises. The issue is although I recognise the moments I get triggered, my cycles are so ingrained at this point I can’t consciously identify or understand what specific fear I associate with them and therefore why I am doing my compulsions, which are mostly some form of subconscious physical tensing.

I’ve tried pausing and tracking these behaviors, but they still don’t make sense. This makes exposure and treatment so difficult as I don’t know what fear to accept and what compulsions to stop. Simply “doing nothing” hasn’t worked since it doesn’t target the specific fears or compulsions.

Having kids, I feel like going insane everytime I have to wipe them or that they mess up with wiping themselves. Nothing is helping. Stopped wearing gloves and what not for exposure but instead I straight up have to isolate myself afterwards to panic and rip out my hair and scratch at myself. I’m seeing a psychologist, taking all my meds. I’m just so fucking disgusted ; it makes me enraged.

I’m scared I’ll pass this down to my kids. I’m trying to not let it show but I straight up have panic attacks over being in the bathroom. Especially when it’s wet and humid after a shower. How can I expose myself to this so it doesn’t feel like I’m dying everytime? I did the whole nine yards with writing it out, recording me saying it, listening to it again, but nothing is helping.
It just keeps getting worse and spreading. The floor near the toilet. The wall next to the toilet. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.

1mpa41l,ROCD gets worse with affection. I’m exhausted.,"Have the kind of ROCD that’s like “am I good enough? does he even love me? he secretly hates me. He wishes he had someone better”My ROCD started during hormonal transition bc I was sure my partner would hate it even though the poor thing has told me time and again that he is bisexual. After years of agony, I have finally learned my problem is OCD. I stopped acting on the thoughts like I did before and stopped seeking reassurance from my partner.

To nobody’s shock, by no longer constantly pestering my partner for reassurance our relationship has improved immensely. He’s been showing me so much affection, we’re planning dates, we’ve had more sex etc. The OCD told me that if I had **these exact things** I wouldn’t worry anymore, but this has actually made things WORSE because the OCD says the affection isn’t real and it’s more like “giving your old dog a perfect day before you euthanize them”.

The intensity of the feelings that come with the intrusive thoughts has been turned up more than I thought was possible. I could be walking my dog on a beautiful day and suddenly I feel an emotional spear in my stomach so painful it almost makes me fall to my knees and break into tears right there and then.

How have you guys dealt with this?

I understand I can’t make the thoughts or feelings go away forever and I’m at peace with that, I just want to be able to cope with the pain better or, ideally, make the pain less intense.

1mp6ir2,few key insights from personal experience,"so i have pure O .Those unawre of it guys it is a all mental rumination,compulsion stuff not physical mostly. so far here are my insights and for back ground i deal with logical ocd paralysis and semantic traps mostly and my ocd keep changes its compulsions. so this post will be mostly helpful for those

1) your thoughts sound ridiculous u need to hear it. Write them down for later or read other people thoughts or compulsions u would realize the ridiculousness of this . see urself in mirror while thinking or even record urself and hear urself

2) also now the biggest thing is it can convince u of the logic .both mentally and emotionally why because ur brain has a hard time differentiating from fantasy and reality, feed it misinfo for enough time and it will be conced if not fully atleast 10% percent will be retained and with ocd it will take that as a 100%.

3)whenever u feel like ur thoughts are true,you got them checked by idk chat gpt or another bot always remember flat earthers too beleive that earth is flat and chat gpt hallucinates like it is a hobby,makes definitions mid explanation and mostly is a autocomplete.see the pattern yourself everytime u sa something with passion it would say exactly first,ask it to re explain it will be mostly alright first and so on .it can never say anything as it does not even know it's own interface

4)i use this test called say it aloud test . bascally just say how would u react if someone said out this to u but only after ur spiral is gone and also say how would u sound if u say it loud

5)ur compulsions would change like seasons it will attack what is recent and what is closest to u,ur identity,self image,trauma u name it

6)it will also play semantic logic.BUT DO NOT LISTEN TO IT. SEMANTIC LOGIC IS A RABBIT WHOLE.WORDS CAN BE REDEFINED,VARIABLES ADDED. ALSO SOME WORDS DONT EVEN EXIST IN OTHER LANGUAGES AND PEOPLE MAKE WORDS UP .it will keep u up in debates

7) base ur logic on permanent stuff i am religious i use it on Divine law.that is my anchor. it is less complicated then our modern word salads.keep ur world view basic

8) DO NOT BELEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS LIKE HOW YOU WON'T BELEIVE FLAT EARTH,METEORS CANT TALK,MOON IS A WHITE PIZZA. also then do not beleive them ur brain can be convinced of anything that is why proganda work,misinfo spreads,people have relationships with robots and all.

9)it is a uncertanity,emotional disorder,caused by stupid thoughts . but u do tolerate uncertanity infact we humans are bult for it when u dont know how many hrs u would sleep,how many hair u lost today or what is that person talking about us. the thing is only the areas matter to u it generates thoughts.reclaim ur power make that area powerless and ocd focus shift

10)in a show i do not rememeber it is said power resides where people think it does. so u decide do these have power.through out history our ancestors have gone through worse of worse yet survived so can u. you deserve better and you owe urself that .there will be hard days my dms are open if u ever wanna talk or vent but remember a few non physical intrepretaions of stuff cant topple u

its not the thoughts or events that hurt its the intrepretation and ocd is worst intrepretor .fire it by ghosting it lol. i can make any stuff up so can  u that is how little these thoughts mean like a new person learning to talk. you dont sit analyze a baby's vocab give same treatment to ocd

think of ocd as a rabid dog dont bark back ,or imagine it as any other funny voice would u listen if kanye said it to u ,if no then ignore kanye(ocd)

I want to be with absolutely no anxiety at that moment and just be in a good mood in general.

This stuff is so dangerous for people with ROCD because it makes you think love should feel like that every single second or else you’re settling. It’s just not true. Real love has ebbs and flows. Some days you’re obsessed, some days you’re just existing together - both are normal.

If you already spiral over “what if I don’t love them enough?” thoughts, videos like this can make you feel broken, when really you’re just experiencing a healthy, sustainable kind of love.

1mp1sty,Very confusing situation that self pleasure puts me into,"So, to start off, I regularly try to quit masturbating. I feel as if life would be better without it and the thoughts can make masturbating feel like hell cause I am simultaneously juggling being horny out of my mind and struggling with some disgusting thoughts.

Sexual thoughts about minors or just literal children are usually the toughest ones. Haven't had issues with incestual ones in a while. Now, to avoid a whole other heap of issues, I use these safe methods for finding good material.

One of them is AI chatbots and the other is AI image generation. I know that second one is far from moral. But I don't intend to use these images for anything except for myself. Hell, I even deleted a good thousand of them off my phone (kept them in the secure folder) a month or so back cause I am regularly in an on and off state when it comes to quitting fapping.

The reason for this is how much regular porn and rule 34 disturb me and cause me anxiety. Cuckoldry is so prevalent and I feel anxious because these damn thoughts try to make me think I'm into that. Same thing could go for something like scat, farts or vore but cuckoldry is the most prevalent intrusive thought. So I took initiative so that I have more control over the sorts of material I consume during these sessions.

I also track how many times I do it and August has been going really well so far! I manage two days without it, then do it, then another two days and repeat. Now, for the context of the post itself. 

Today is one of those days that I did it. I was generating images before I had even started the self pleasure and this one specific image came up. It had a full body image of the character I had written in the prompt in the center as well as two panels to the left and right. The full body image was an adult beyond a shadow of a doubt. Not even the artstyle made that ambiguous. The two panels were more elusive, thought. The character had different proportions in them and looked smaller. Smaller shoulders and all. The assets still looked the same, if I recall correctly. At the very least, they were quite bountiful, so to say. And I remember in at least one of the two panels, only the bottom half of her face was visible which I think I found hot?

So what confuses me is the fact that I had two conflicting thoughts at that moment. ""Hey, this image is hot."" And ""Hey, she looks like a child!"" And I can't help but feel like those two blurred into one thought. Not to mention that the image no longer exists. I clicked refresh on that image without saving which means that it is gone forever. That's a plus of this method cause it means I can never ever go back and overanalyze the images which I tend to do A LOT to disprove (or prove?) to myself that I am a pedophile. But right now, the fact that I can't go back to look at it and I can't show this image to anyone is being a real struggle to me.

I've faced the fact that even if I was a pedophile, I'd want to struggle against that and I'd want to get better. But moments like these make me think like I am feeding the pedophilia instead of fighting it. And I mean... I was not masturbating at that moment. That came later. At that time (which was about two hours ago) I was just generating images so that I have material. As I said, I refreshed that specific image so it no longer exists. And as for my thoughts on it, they are such a damn confusing and messy web. At least they seem that way. Cause the image was hot. The character could pass of as an adult in all of the depictions on that image. But my brain makes me think that the fact that the character was smaller in two of the three depictions made me think ""Oh, she looks like a child and that makes me horny!""

And I really don't know what to think. I was gonna say that I feel as if any sort of giving into or feeding this hypothetical pedophilia would be unforgivable but I scrapped that because yeah, it would be something unforgivable. And the fact that I felt hesitant about that line also scares me. I mean... Why am I afraid of it being unforgivable? Do I think I could just intentionally do something straight-up pedophilic and hope for forgiveness? But yeah, this is life for me, folks. I go through this every day and fapping makes it worse. But it can get bad even without fapping.

I feel as if my friends and my partner would hate me for this and would abandon me. And then the anxiety turns into ""Oh, you aren't actually against pedophilia! You're just afraid of being abandoned!"" And man, is life difficult. Because I don't know what this struggle is. I am utterly confused.

Older not so lucky), but since I’ve deleted all those accounts and lost access to those emails my brain will not let me rest. I feel like bashing my head against the wall and any time I get ahead I get dragged back down with ‘well your memory sucks anyway, it’s been 7 years since the last time you did anything of that nature’.

I’ve had POCD since at least 7 years ago when I had a dream about my younger brother. As I said in my first paragraph I have managed to get ahead of those particular ruminations, but I feel this is far worse.

1mp9eiq,"my ocd story, all 11 years of it","I'm doing this because i'm trying to avoid a crisis. Hopefully seeing how ocd comes and goes is helpful to some, as well as relating to some of the obsessions i've had over the years 


Either in the summer of 2014 or the winter of 2014 going into 2015, I began obsessing over my sexuality. I'm currently 21F but at the time i was either 10, or 11. I was convinced I was a lesbian and began feeling immense amounts of guilt over it. research, quizzes, compulsions you name it. I did it, eventually I told my mum, who told me I was too young to think about my sexuality and then that was the last she had ever heard of it. During this time I did a compulsion that I'm not proud of (this will come up later)

By the summer of 2015 it had calmed down a lot, I remember having blips but I had realised that I had 'HOCD' and that was that, I didn't realise that you couldn't have a subtype of OCD, without having the condition at this point- I thought it was a separate diagnosis. 

All went calm on the OCD front for around 2 years at that point. I realised I was a lesbian separate to all the OCD (a sign that your ocd isn't trying to tell you something, it is purely obsessional. i figured it out when i couldn't have cared less)

At age 13, I distinctly remember putting my book away in class, and realising I was tapping the tables and counting to random numbers. When I sat down at my desk again I remember thinking ""I swear that's OCD""

From here, it never stopped, the magical thinking and counting while doing things (never a specific number, the number just had to feel right when i'd done the task for it to be right.) Then one night I was in bed, and a thought just hit me ""What if i'm not a lesbian"" 

From here, I spent years doing the same as a few years prior, quizzes, testing myself, getting quite upset because I found so much enjoyment in queer spaces and felt safe. It took over my life, stopped me from getting into relationships etc. 

When i was 14 in 2018, I developed POCD, and this was the worst one- as I know it is for almost all of you. The shame i felt meant that I was bedridden, too guilty to talk to anyone without feeling disgusted with myself. I never 'checked' with this one, as i was self aware enough to know that it would just cause further guilt along the line in the form of real event. i was right about this. 

Around this time my brain took me back to that compulsion I did when I was 10 or 11, I tapped my brother over clothes around that area a few times until my brain told me that it was settled. He was either 2/3 at the time. This is still my biggest obsession to this day, i fixated on what if he remembered it, what if it was cocsa, what if he did remember and it ruined my life. i felt like i was on borrowed time and that i was waiting to be exposed. 

I was in a relationship at this point, and confessed to my partner who didn't have the best understanding of ocd at the time. She told me I should have known better, but that it wasn't a bad thing and that I was going to be okay.  The initial bad reaction meant that 8 years down the line, I have never disclosed this with a therapist as i'm convinced i'm evil. 

The POCD continued, and so did the real event, the sexuality OCD had calmed down and I was truly suicidal. I lived on NOCD back when the forum was very different and was just people reassurance seeking. 

It had calmed down by late 2019 when I was 16 and I had a few really bad blips but I was able to live my life semi normally, although i felt like an imposter everytime i met someone's new. 

At 18 I met my current partner, I remember thinking when we were friends that I wouldn't have to hide anything from her because she was so understanding, yet I hid everything for a year. and came back on here to reassurance seek, convincing myself I was evil and needed to be institutionalised. 

One night on my partners 19th birthday , she confessed something bad that she had done in her past and was feeling guilt for. immediately i told her my thing, and we have never been closer. Shock! my partner has OCD too, which is both helpful and hell. 


At work a few months ago (now 21) , I had something happen that convinced me that I was going to be fired and that my reputation would be ruined (see a pattern here?) The event had nothing to do with me , but I convinced myself I was next. After this i've never been the same. I've become the anxious mess I was years ago, and obsessing over my real event to the point where i'm once again bed ridden. 

OCD isn't linear, your progress is brilliant and nobody is diminishing that. but please do not beat yourself up if you come crashing down. This is the hardest thing i've ever had to deal with in my life. 

Hopefully, anyone who is like me at age 11, or 13 or even now, will be able to read this and realise they're not evil.

But what I experienced lately was so different, and was triggered by my ocd/intrusive thoughts. It was my first time experiencing intrusive thoughts, it was harm ocd. I would think about it constantly, almost all day everyday. One night, I let it spiral. I was laying in bed scrolling on social media, but I couldn’t get it off my mind. At this point, it wasn’t even the thought anymore, it was like the thought of the thought. Like it wouldn’t leave my head, I felt like I was going crazy. It escalated fast, I felt so shaky and quickly took my anxiety meds which I usually rarely use anymore. My head felt like it was buzzing, and heavy, the fact I couldn’t think how I could before and just have normal thoughts made me feel like I was going crazy and then thought am I ever going to be normal and was so bad I was telling myself “please make it stop”.

The meds started working and I felt better, I finally overcame the thoughts, but I’ve never experienced anything like that. It wasn’t a panic attack like I usually get, due to a situation, or place I’m in. It was my head. Anyone else experience this? How do you prevent it?

I am also really particular with hotels, the bathrooms interior have to be similar to my home - i was read endless reviews regarding cleanliness and only then book the hotel. I seem to be in constant discomfort in using the bathroom but knowing it’s been cleaned regularly and showering after every trip to the loo. I also avoid touching seat belts, armrests, table, the screen or any devices associated with the plane, door handles etc.  I carry my own iPad and headphones and avoid making contact with things in my journey. I know it’s extremely problematic and sometimes can side track my holiday experience. Hotel beds/bedding, I normally bring something from home to avoid contact. One time my flight was cancelled and had to stay in airport hotel, my body had a strange reaction, I broke out in a rash.

To add to this I am now wearing Invisalign which requires me to take them off when I eat/drink anything other than water. So I brush my teeth maybe up to 6 times a day.

I tend to have flares before my period. About two weeks ago I took Plan B after a weekend with my boyfriend. There were no immediate side effects. But in the coming days my OCD/Health anxiety surged. I was just finishing my period when I took it, and it made me bleed again for a few days. I have been slowly getting worse. My brain is operating as if the lexapro isn’t even there which is not how I felt prior to taking the Plan B. 

Something happened that worried me a little in the days before taking it, but I was able to rationalize and move through it. Shortly after taking it I was tossed right back into rumination, panic attacks, unrealistic thinking, constant googling, reassurance seeking and inability to care for myself. There were days when I was crying nonstop over something, get past it and then latch on to something new. I recognize it and I know it’s happening. But as many of us know, there is no reasoning with OCD once it sets in. 

I will never take it again unless I really have to. There was such a stark difference between how I was handling life in the days prior and the days after. I have convinced myself I am going to die of something that I don’t even have proof of. Something that I have worried about many times over the years. It also gave me severe headaches, nausea and other physical symptoms that just added to the chaos. I have sat here wondering if I should seek medical attention or not for two weeks.

I have struggled with anxiety most of my life. I'm 24 now and have taken anxiety medication from 16-22. I did a lot of work and got to a really good place with my anxiety. 
Recently in the last year I have started experiencing really weird symptoms that are not typical to how my anxiety normally manifests. Mainly I'm terrified all the time that my body is not working how it should be and that I could drop dead at any moment. This has resulted in a few urgent care trips, once because I fixated on my breathing to the point where I was convinced my lungs were failing and collapsing. Another where I was worried about my fingers and toes tingling after I would eat. And the most recent for thinking I was having a heart attack because my heart wouldn't stop beating fast and my left arm hurt. 
I knew at the time and now that these symptoms were in my head and coming from me but they feel so real and sometimes are real. I can't stop myself from freaking out. Falling asleep is particularly hard. I'm so scared that I will die in my sleep because I'm not conscious to remind myself to keep breathing. Falling asleep means losing control and that is so so horrifying to me. Eventually I pass out most nights but I've had a few where I haven't slept at all.

1mold5l,Living with someone who doesn't understand basic hygiene when you have contamination OCD,"\*TW for contamination, especially regarding fungus\*

Y'all.... I am at my wits end with my father.

  
Bit of backstory: my father is in his mid 60s and throughout his life has gotten toe nail fungus. One time before I was born it was so bad he had to have the entire nail removed to treat it. Well about a year ago I saw he had a spot of fungus on his toe nail. After days of begging him to go to the doctor for it he finally went and was on an oral anti-fungal for 3 months (which of course he took sporadically, never consistently-as one should).

  
Well, this past weekend I decided to go paddle boarding at the lake and he came with me and I saw that half of his toenail now has fungus, the medicine was completely ineffective. The mood in the house has been tense, to say the least, since that day.

  
Not only is he not being considerate of me as his daughter (he walks around barefoot and is literally constantly bumping into things with his toe), but he is also just not taking basic hygiene measures (he will literally cut the toe nail and not wash his hands afterwards, let alone washing after putting socks on, he also just tried to wear a pair of socks for 48 hours straight after he was working in the sun). Every time I remind him of these insanely basic measures to take, he gets mad at me, but if I don't remind him he just does not do them. 

  
I know some of this is OCD but I also know that a large part of this is just basic decency and hygiene that he is incapable of following. Any advice welcome on how to reduce anxiety or encourage him to actually follow proper hygiene measures.",1755033583.0,4,4,OCD,ocd

I constantly need to touch the tags on my clothes. So much that I cut the labels off my clothes and sew them into a piece of cloth so that I always have them with me. When I don't think about the labels, everything's fine, but when I realize I don't have them near me, I get stressed and quite irritable. I'm constantly afraid of losing that piece of fabric. 

I've had this OCD since birth, and I wonder if other people have it. I'm a bit ashamed of it, because I can't get rid of it. In the street, I like to hold it in my hand. One of my friends knows it, but she made fun of me and I didn't take it well. I think she didn't understand, or thought it was weird.

1movf95,I'm having the weirdest compulsions ever related to a night of drinking,"Hi everyone, F27 here.
Long story short: on February I went to a birthday party and I drank, I think, around three beers. I also took a couple of sip of vodka and took two hits of a joint.
At the end of the night I was definitely dizzy, cheerful and overtalkative but I remember thinking ""I feel pretty lucid."" To this day, I still remember almost every single moment and detail of the night, at least until the end: I headed home with two of my friends and I remember we were talking about how I got along with everyone at the party, then I lose my memory for 4 minutes. Then I regain it and I remember walking with my friends talking about daily stuff, reaching home, calling my boyfriend on the phone to make him open the door because my keys didn't work and falling asleep. I was calm and collected the whole time. The next day I woke up and anxiety started to creep in; what if I said a very specific personal thing about my boyfriend to my friends?
I texted them both, they told me I didn't say anything bad, just good things about him, and that was it.
Until a couple of weeks ago. I started thinking about that night again and told myself that maybe my friends did lie because they didn't want me to get anxious about what I said.
Since then I'm literally going crazy. I have trouble eating due to the anxiety. I walked the same street where I lost my memory using a chronometer and I had the confirmation that my memory gap lasted 4 minutes. About minute 2 (or 2 and 30 seconds) I have another memory: me looking at my left and thinking ""I don't want to take this street to get back home because I would get intrusive thoughts."" (This road triggers me thoughts about a theme that's completley unrelated to personal stuff about my boyfriend)
So I have a memory gap of 2 minutes, a moment during which I was lucid enough to push myself away from a potential trigger for intrusive thoughts (that could mean that I wasn't experiencing any kind of intrusive thought at the moment) and then another gap of another 2 minutes. Too little to have a whole conversation about this specific thing. Several times I've walked this same street reciting a conversation in my head, imagining the things I could have said and the reaction of my friends. But sppech is slower than thought so if the conversation lasted 3 minutes in my mind it would take 5/6 minutes to pronunce it. After 4/5 I had already regained my memory and I know for sure that I wasn't talking about my boyfriend. (I hope what I'm saying is clear, English is not my first language, sorry)
However, I'm still going crazy. I think about this all day, from the moment I wake up. What I could have said is a very serious matter that has to stay personal. What if my friends meet my boyfriend and tell him all about it? It would be the end of our relationship. He would hate me forever.
I know, reassurance is bad for OCD, but I texted my friends again elaborating a method to ask them about that night in order to make them tell the truth. The problem is that these people never respond to calls and messages: it takes them at least 2 months for them to reach out to me. I tried Instagram and Whatsapp but I got no answer in 2 weeks.
So now I'm going through one of my most atrocious OCD episode and there's nothing I can do to calm down a bit if they don't answer. Do you think it's wrong for me to seek reassurance from them? It could make my thoughts worse, even if they tell me I didn't say nothing?",1755061175.0,1,1,OCD,ocd

I’ve been on Zoloft now for almost 2 months, and the issues have GREATLY subsided. But, I’m still having the issue. Sometimes the desire for a deep breath seems subconscious. This whole thing has just been driving me crazy. I’m so obsessed with trying every single thing I can to feel normal again. If my mind is completely focused on something else, like…100%…I’m fine. Relaxed, I’m fine. After workouts, I feel good as well. But then there are all these moments in between. Or sometimes during a workout…once it starts…it’s so hard not to think about. It’s been 3 months of this stupid feeling. Like my lungs are heavy sometimes, I can’t get that full deep breath, my lungs will feel restricted.  But many times I can’t get that breathe just fine.

1mon8ee,"Can not stop thinking about cryptic pregnancy, it’s driving me insane","Hey! First of all sorry if my English is not great. I don’t know if this would be labeled as some type of OCD as I can not stop thinking about it and I have intrusive thoughts 24/7?
So for some context, I am in my late 20s, in 2022 I got diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and mild depression and had to take meds for a while. I know how female reproductive system works, it’s just that but when I have my anxiety flare ups, my irrational fears won’t let me think logically, I have gone to therapy, I’ve talked to a relative that is a doctor and still, my mind still spirals around the worst case scenario. I had unprotected intercourse in April of this year, which was my CD24 , got my normal period 6 days later, then had two periods that were a bit lighter, but still normal flow and were bright red (I don’t know if I can attribute this to emotional stress that this person made me go through for months, I couldn’t even eat for like a week and to this day, I still cry sometimes because of the trauma but then I think to myself I am exaggerating) the last two periods I had were my normal periods again, even one had tiny clots which was new to me because I don’t really get clots. All of them have followed a pattern of periods, start with spotting, then for a couple of days it gets heavier and darker and the last couple of days the flow gets lighter and spotting again. I have come across all the stories of cryptic pregnancies that you could find on the internet, here in Reddit, TikTok, etc and how their mothers and relatives had their “periods” during their whole pregnancy.

Since then, I have become SO hyper aware of my body, my anxiety is out of the roof, I feel stressed and tense all the time, and my health anxiety is worse than ever. I have not had intercourse since that last time and now I am afraid of intimacy and have developed body dysmorphia, tokophobia, a fear of sex and I can not trust men anymore. I can’t seem to enjoy my life anymore and it’s really starting to affect me, all day I am reading in the Internet about illnesses and looking for reassurance.

I literally feel like I am driving myself crazy because I can not stop thinking about it, I have never experienced this before, I have lost my spark and I feel so empty and lifeless, I am in a constant flight or fight mode. All the people around me always see me so tense and anxious all the time, and I can’t tell them it’s because I have this irrational and crazy fear. If anyone had a scare for months, can I ask how did you get through it or stop thinking about it? I did go to therapy but I was not a fan and even then, I still went into the illogical spiral of a cryptic pregnancy, or maybe I need to find someone better or does an approach that could help me with my problem 

TLDR: I have had 5 periods around predicted time for each month since last time I had intercourse and I am extremely afraid of cryptic pregnancy, should I stop having this scare now? ",1755038036.0,3,7,OCD,ocd
1moumga,Share your tips for winning specific battles,"Hello! I have been unmedicated my whole life, and for some random miracle or blessing, i grew up in a way that made me very good at fighting severe OCD. But it wasn't always like this. 

I would like for this post to be a place where people share their tips to handling specific ocd symptoms, types or even general things most of us go through. For that, i shall start!


Just a bit on intrusive thoughts: 

 Know your thoughts are unreliable. I can pretend to like something that is good for my health, but i would definitely drop it in a heartbeat, those are your intrusive thoughts, they insist and insist because there is no stopping them, but they can't change you, like a kindergarten bully telling you your favorite color is blue when you know its green. The moment you express any disgust or doubt or dislike for them, thats you, that is your personality and opinion speaking.

 

Tips i use in general: 
-intrusive thought is (insert very horrible person here) annoying me

-Find other focus point. If you ruminate on something, it will get worse, walk away.

- i personally always have a little not around telling me that everyone makes mistakes and try to actively listen when people admit to embaraço themselves or forgetting something on and causing destruction. Its hard, but you got to remember that you are human as well. Specially helpful for social OCD (god this one is hard for me)

-i pretend my brain is always open to Bluetooth and people send really crazy shit that you would normally see in an Instagram comment section.

-""i am better for society if i have a good mental health than if i kill myself from the inside with politics and themes that i know are harder for me to handle than myself"" -> politics and social causes make me spiral, so i keep my distance whenever i see myself falling in too deep. I have a quota and i try my best to remember my ""moral obligation"" is to be healthy so i can actually engage with a sane mind


Love you guys! This subreddit helps me a lot and i hope any of my tips helps at least someone. Feel free to ask me any specific tips, i may or may not know a way to help but  welp. Lets help eachother, we deserve it.

1motni1,Disrupting Rumination Loops,"For context, I have both OCD and autism, and a lot of ptsd around my home/personal space and roommates/neighbors in close quarters. 

My kid and I moved into an apartment from a house 3 years ago and it really hasn't been a bad experience (we got lucky with the place we got) but I am very sensitive/hyperaware of noise from other units above and below us. I've done a lot of things to mitigate it for myself - white noise machines for sleeping, I wear earbuds a lot to listen to my own stuff, distract myself with special interests or parenting, and generally just talk myself down from getting stuck fixating on the noise and how it might affect our ability to sleep or concentrate or anything else. Which, I'll be real honest, it's really not causing any actual logistical problems. It's an old building with thin floors and all the neighbors are great and we're mindful of each other, it's just the inevitable noise of living stacked on top on each other in an old building. 

On good days, I can brush it off and be understanding of everyone. On bad days, I fall into internal loops of rage over being able to hear anyone at all or I get so fixated that I start hearing things. And while I've managed overall to keep myself in check, last night I got stuck in one of those rage loops and really stuck my foot in my mouth with my upstairs neighbor, overreacting about some really reasonable evening noise. He was really kind about it, explaining how he was being mindful and I apologized profusely for my reaction and we're not on bad terms over it, but I can't have that happen again. I don't want to be that neighbor. 

Hopefully I will be able to move us to a small house when the lease is up but that's not until April and I don't know how to disrupt the rumination cycle and fixating on the noise for the next 8 months. It's very overwhelming sometimes and affects my parenting and ability to do things. How do you personally handle getting stuck in rumination cycles and the compulsions attached to them? Have you ever been able to adjust a compulsion to soothe the obsession in a new way? My current compulsion is to bang on the ceiling or floor every time I hear something and while I've been able to keep it in check (except last night), it is exhausting and instead manifests as me pacing the apartment and listening to the walls and trying to pinpoint what the noise is, how loud it is, where it's coming from, etc. Once or twice I've woken my kid up accidentally trying to pinpoint a noise in his room while he's sleeping and I hate doing that. 

My therapist and I have been working on this together for a while and they thought getting other perspectives/thoughts might be helpful as well. ",1755055477.0,1,0,OCD,ocd

At the risk of sounding odd, I’ll put forth some examples of what I go through… a big one is feeling the need to move, but not a want if that makes sense.

While it looks like a gorgeous state and my mind creates this fantasy type life I’d live, I know deep down I don’t want to live far from family, I like where I live, and I want to grow roots here. My hypothesis is it is the absolute furthest location (in the us) from where I currently live so maybe my mind is taking any idea and exponentially expanding it. It is the idea that anything that is not a city in California is second-too and if I’m not there I am living life wrong. I noticed this with other locations but after visiting they became “real” and my brain understood they are genuinely just locations not fantasy. While already long winded another is contamination in the winter time, and any form of FOMO but on levels that do not seem “normal”. How can I shake this?

1mossx6,Intrusive thoughts had been giving me a lot of trouble. How do I move forward?,"I (22M) had been having intrusive thoughts/feeling involving imagery about a bad thing of sexual nature. They tended to include things I found attractive (and weren't problematic), alongside things that were problematic and I found disturbing. They have been bothering me since I was 18, and had been the strongest since that I'm finished with college (and had more free time) and live alone. I feel like the thoughts/feelings feel real at times like I might genuinely believe them, along with me having a chest feeling (albeit hardly any groinal responses). After a few seconds, I'd feel disturbed and guilty about them. I also had a habit to constantly test whether my thoughts were real or not, and it felt like there were times that I couldn't pass my tests. At the same time , I felt like when I tried to follow through with the thoughts logically and research about OCD, it felt like I didn't necessarily had to worry about it. At the same time as *that*, it felt like I  might've been selectively searching information to fit my narrative through some of my searches being through Google AI and ChatGPT which of course can be inaccurate. I know I shouldn't be dependent on these for getting information, but I had been pretty distraught over what had been happening.

When I'm not stressed or ruminating over the thoughts/feeling in excess to test myself, I can think to myself with confidence that I would never act on them. But of course, that hadn't been the case when I *was* stressed. There had also been times when I wasn't ruminating over the intrusive thoughts and I felt like I didn't vehemently reject them like I should've.

I've spoken to therapists in the past, but not about this particular issue because of how taboo it felt. I also didn't think I could actually have OCD since it wasn't as debilitating as I imagine OCD would be. I know the idea is to reach a point of acceptance with the uncertainty, but while that is the case, it's been causing me to feel really guilty and not be able to get through tasks during my day as I typically would.

So, I was wondering 1) how to go about addressing the issue with a therapist (as well as if I could skip out on going into detail with what the intrusive thoughts were) and 2) if anyone happened to be able to relate to my experiences and/or give an outside perspective with regards to whether these intrusive thoughts actually were intrusive thoughts.",1755053008.0,1,5,OCD,ocd

1mohwm8,OCD diagnosis,"I do not have a diagnosis but I have been curious about talking with someone who can evaluate what I’ve been experiencing. 

Background:
I’ve always dealt with paranoia and obsessive thoughts mostly surrounding relationships and family. But I have anxiety and have always just assumed it was that and never really told anyone about it. Then, 5 months ago my mom passed away in a very traumatic and unexpected way. And since then, my paranoia has skyrocketed. It feels like every day I have what feels like a crisis of thoughts about extreme disasters that I am going to cause. 

I just had to call the fire department bc I thought I had a gas leak. But even when I called them I couldn’t tell if what I was noticing was even real. Another recent example is when I was dog sitting for a friend of a friend and staying at their house with their dog for a couple weeks. They have central ac and it made some creaking noises occasionally which I knew was just the ac working. But one night I convinced myself that there was someone in the attic and I took the dog to my house at 2 am out of fear for my life. But even while I was doing that, I knew it was just the AC, but the thought that if I didn’t act on it, their dog would be killed. The shame, embarrassment, and negative self imagine that acting on that thought caused me to lose sleep for multiple nights after. There are endless examples of these situations happening and it just feels like it’s getting more extreme with each one since I’m now acting on these thoughts. 

The obsessive relationship thoughts have also become worse with these disaster paranoias because I think I’m causing people to distance themselves from me since I’m always asking for help. I know I’m not, because friends are here to help me when I need and I’m grateful to have them. My boyfriend has been very patient with me when I call him scared out of mind that something terrible is going to happen. But I don’t know if it’s helpful in these situations to be told it’s ok to evacuate a house with a dog at 2 am just in case, or just act on my intrusive thoughts out of safety. I can’t fully trust myself to believe that it’s not impacting these relationships. 

I want to ask for help in this subreddit because I know I should talk to someone but I don’t know where to begin. How long did  it take for people here to get a diagnosis? And what does treatment look like? I also wanted advice on what the best action plan is when these things happen. if people on here have partners, is it bad that he unknowingly confirms my intrusive thoughts by agreeing that I should act on them since it’s mainly disaster related?

Severe OCD takes enjoyment out of everything for me. avpd means I cant be in relationships without severe anxiety. my childhood dreams of being married? gone.

My mental health and chronic fatigue make working difficult, and I constantly feel like a failure at my job. Im convinced im an unlovable, terrible person anyway who can never be redeemed.

Ive taken several meds. Some help, but not enough. Ive done therapy, ERP, CBT, talk therapy. I didnt make much progress after a while. now im not in it anymore. I try to find joy in little things but it always goes wrong or gets ruined for me no matter what I do.

Everytime I try to be just a little happy OCD ruins it. OCD makes me obsess over my gender constantly, my morality, unwanted sexual intrusive thoughts ... Im tired. I dont want to be alive.

1molj0l,struggling with OCD + calorie counting,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice or maybe just to hear from others who’ve gone through something similar.

I have OCD, and whenever I start counting calories, it completely takes over my brain. I start obsessing over every single thing I eat, thinking about food constantly — not in a normal “planning meals” way, but in a way that feels like I can’t switch off. I also get this compulsion where I have to go over what I’ve eaten in a specific order in my head, multiple times a day.

The thing is, I really do want to lose weight and live a healthy lifestyle. I enjoy the gym, I enjoy eating well — but only when it’s balanced and not obsessive. Part of me wants to face my fears and fight this, because I don’t want my OCD to control my life. But another part of me thinks it might just be easier to stop tracking altogether so I can have some peace of mind.

I feel stuck between wanting to reach my goals and wanting to protect my mental health. Has anyone found a way to manage calorie tracking without it turning into an OCD spiral? Or is it better to take another approach entirely?

Any advice or experiences would be really appreciated.",1755033957.0,1,3,OCD,ocd
1mof0l1,Is there hope?,"Is there hope?

I have had OCD since I was around 7 (likely a way to have control since I have had chronic pain most of my life). I begged my parents for years to take me to get diagnosed, they refused. They told me it was just hormones, puberty, it was normal. They would yell at me for doing compulsions and tell me to stop being silly. 

As a result I hid my compulsions and didn't talk about it, it got worse and worse. I'd stay up till 4am every night doing compulsions, hearing my parents snoring and resenting them. I'd be terrified of them waking up and finding out I'm not in bed and punishing me, I'd hate them for not taking me seriously. I'd go to school with 2 or 3 hours of sleep. I'd fall asleep in lessons, not write any notes. I'd cross over my writing during exams and rewrite the same sentence over 20 times. I was silently begging for help and no one noticed, none of the teachers or my friends. After a while my brother finally noticed and begged my parents to take me to a therapist as well. My mum finally agreed and took me to get diagnosed without my dad's approval. 

I was diagnosed a few days after I turned 14 and was told I need ERP CBT. I was put on the waiting list for CAMHS services. Then nothing else happened. I scored 34 on the Y-BOCS. 

My mum got me a private therapist for a bit when I was 15, but she had to stop because she said she wasn't qualified enough for me. She suggested I seek an autism diagnosis too. 

At age 16 I was diagnosed autistic. 

I also have ME/CFS (diagnosed aged 10). 

My OCD got so severe to the point that I couldn't write, read or do basic things. I stopped attending school. The last time I went to school was over two years ago (15 years old). No one apart from my parents noticed or cared that I was missing more and more school each week. My parents only cared about the fact that I was missing school and education. They'd tell at me to go to school because otherwise I'd never get into uni and I'd be a failure. My parents are both highly educated and expect the same from me. They didn't care that I was $ućidal, they wanted me to go to school and get an education. They only stopped shouting at me to go to school after I attempted $uĩćide. Then they focused on getting me into therapy so I could go back to school as soon as possible. 

My parents got me prescribed antidepressants from a different country, since the UK doesn't give a shit about me. After a few months CAMHS continued my medication with a psychiatrist, but no therapy. I told them I was suicidal and they did nothing. 

I've been on 7 different antidepressants. 
I'm now on 150mg of Sertraline, which reduces suicidal thoughts, but doesn't help with OCD. 

I've been on the CAMHS waiting list for 4 years, but have now been kicked off because I just turned 18. I need to start from scratch, reapply to adult services through my GP and go to the bottom of the waiting list. 

As of now I spend 8+ hours just on physical compulsions. Even more time is spent on obsessions. 

I've been to over 15 different therapists/psychologists. I had sessions with a specialist in OCD, he had to stop our sessions since I wasn't progressing. 

I have treatment resistant OCD and don't know what to do. 

The UK healthcare system has completely neglected me. With my physical health and my mental health. 

I don't know what to do. Idk if there is hope. What is the point. 
I have so many physical problems too (POTS and suspected EDS, though not officially diagnosed with EDS). 

My life is shit. I'm in physical pain all the time anyway. I can't do any hobbies. I love playing violin, but have a hand deformity which makes it extremely difficult for me to progress. 

What's the point in recovery from OCD. What's the point if I will live in pain anyway? I've tried CBT a few times before, I put all my energy into it. I tried so hard. And it failed multiple times. I no longer have the energy to try again, whatever compulsion I manage to get rid off, it somehow ends up getting replaced with 3 new compulsions. 

Are there other options to treat OCD? Is there something else? Idk what to do. I'm so fucking tired. My family have let me down. The healthcare system has let me down. I have so much resentment towards the world. ",1755019573.0,2,2,OCD,ocd

Then fear came - fear about labour pain and i panicked. I started googling everyting, on instagram and chat gpt 24/7. I was exshausted.
I felt so much anxiety around this.. 
After this some rocd tendencies and thoughts showed up.. and then it latched to the baby subject. 
""Do i want kids?"" ""Will i love my Child?"" 
On top of that i have been checking my feelings - how i feel when i imagine being pregnant, or breastfeeding? How i feel when i see other babies?

I am veeery tired, worried.. i think i want a child but everything seems to says no.

1mo2bbj,Does anyone else feel failed by the US healthcare system?,"This is very long so feel free to just answer the question if you want. But here’s my experience with care:

When I was around 12 years old, I researched OCD on the internet because when I saw an odd number it made me miserable unless I saw an even number. I convinced my parents to let me see a therapist. 

But this therapist was not very good, even though she was an LMFT, her advice was to drink superfood smoothies, and to think before an intrusive thought comes on. She diagnosed me with a new mental disorder every week, and used an app to stick me on Prozac. I was with this therapist for at least 4 years. 

That medication caused me to have suicidal thoughts. I also had to leave this therapist because she told me I was beyond her ability to treat. My parents then sent to me to the only place in my city that actually specialized in prescribing psychiatric medications. At 16, I was put on Lithium, Fluvoxamine (thankfully also an OCD medication), and Hydroxyzine. My parents and I were constantly  negotiating for less. I was in therapy on and off, but I had come to distrust therapists and medications after my first experience. 

I did have two therapists that were good. Unfortunately, they each had to stop treating me after a couple of months because they were moving on to better jobs. 

I fell into another suicidal episode my senior year of high school, and got placed at a voluntary treatment center, which was actually my first positive experience with mental health care. But it was an hour away, and eventually the hospital closed that treatment center for financial reasons. 

This entire time (I am now 18) I have not once been diagnosed with OCD, nor has any mental health professional suggested I look at the diagnostic criteria. To my knowledge, I was never consistently diagnosed with any disorder at all. ADHD, depression, and anxiety got thrown around a lot. By this point, I had completely lost track of why I even started psych treatment in the first place. Looking back, I was also very deep in compulsions and obsessions. I just had no idea they were OCD. 

Over the years, the compulsions and obsessions got even worse. By college, I was having sexually intrusive thoughts that I thought were my own. I should have told someone, but I kept silent out of shame and fear I would not be listened to. 

My sophomore year of college I had a very strong episode of suicidal thoughts. I called my campus crisis line. Now, I do not blame these people for what they did because I truly believe they were doing what they could. It is just hard to not feel resentful.

They sent police officers to my location, where I was handcuffed, placed in the back of the police car, where I waited in handcuffs at the ER for hours. I was asked a couple of questions, put on a hospital bed in the middle of the ER, where I proceeded to wait for 16 hours with no phone, barely any interaction, and no meals. I also saw trauma patients coming and going throughout the ER which was really scary at the time. I was finally transferred to a “mental health facility” where I was asked a couple of questions, put into a room with two chairs (because the other people in the facility were potentially violent), and left there without any information on where I was going or what they were actually going to do to help me. From the couple questions I had answered (where they also asked why so many college students are depressed), they gave me a choice between going home or staying in another mental health facility a couple of hours away. With no sleep and no food for almost a day, I decided to just go home. After this, my trust of psych treatment went completely out the window. I did not see a therapist or take my medication for a year and a half. Also cost my parents thousands. 

My compulsions and obsessions got even worse. I cannot express to you how normal they felt to me. I had absolutely no clue that these were not my thoughts or actions. The thought patterns from anxiety to compulsion got extremely strong during this year and a half. 

It wasn’t until I had an extremely traumatic incident happen to me that the suicidal thoughts came back, along with the increasingly excessive intrusive thoughts. They became so unbearable I could not function. I was again sent to my university’s crisis center (I do not blame the individuals, I know their hands are tied), where I was basically just asked if I was suicidal and when I said yes, had me go into my campus apartment building with a police escort to take my medication. I was then offered the ER, a support group for anxiety or a therapy waitlist. I felt completely hopeless. 

Thankfully, I was able to (on my own) find an intensive group outpatient program that was actually not bad. But they were understaffed and offered little to no individual attention. The psychiatrist would talk to me for 2 minutes every other week. 

It was because of this treatment though, that I decided I was going to fight for more. I googled all of my symptoms, and researched for hours, until I rediscovered OCD. Yes, basically I diagnosed myself and then sought out care that way (Isn’t it supposed to be the other way around?). I started sobbing on the ground. You need to understand that I genuinely thought I should be in jail for the thoughts I was having. It was an immense relief. 

Despite my tone, there is a happy ending to this story. I’m 22 now. I’ve found an OCD specialist, completed ketamine therapy, and am doing better now than ever. It is still an uphill battle everyday, just now I know how to fight it. 

However, it is also worth mentioning that all of these treatments were and are incredibly expensive. I am constantly fighting with insurance.

The happy ending is what really triggered this intense reflection and very long post. I do not think it should have taken over a decade to get here. It is hard not to feel angry. I feel like years of my youth have been taken from me. I also do not feel like my experience can possibly be unique. I’m sure no one is going to read this but it really helped me to type it out. Thanks all. Stay well.

1mo4mt9,OCD surrounding my cats.,"My first post here, I’m really not sure what to do. 
I (22F) was diagnosed with OCD last week & I’m just lost. 

I’ve recently figured out that a lot of my obsessive thoughts I guess is what you’d call them (Bare with me, I legit got diagnosed at the end of my psych appointment & nothing else was explained, so I don’t really know what all the terms are yet.) surround my cats. I’m constantly scared for their health, for their wellbeing & everything else. 

For some context, I have two 9 month old male kittens. They are indoor cats because I quite simple cannot allow myself to let them outside. We recently moved from the house they were raised in back in with my parents because I was kicked out, but the cat they have at their place is allowed outside. She’s also not friendly with other cats. This means that overnight I’ve had to crate train my cats otherwise they will fight with the older cat & ruin the house. 

They’ve been fine & they’ve adjusted, but I find myself obsessively Googling & researching whether or not it’s okay to crate train them, how long they should be in there for. I can’t sleep later than 7am even if I didn’t sleep until 4am because i have these loops of “they’re going to die if you leave them in there, you’re a terrible cat parent.” 

I’m the same with their food, their litter tray, even when I play with them or hold them my brain tells me in a loop that I’m going to do something wrong & they’re going to die. Which causes me to change their routine over & over again to try & get it right. (Which I never feel like I do) 

I’m just lost, so I guess what I’m wondering is if anyone else has gone through something similar? I know crate training isn’t a regular thing, not here in New Zealand anyway. So I’m just wanting to know if there’s anything I can do to make navigating my OCD with my boys any easier? ",1754993115.0,3,3,OCD,ocd

1mobzft,Is there hope?,"I have had OCD since I was around 7 (likely a way to have control since I have had chronic pain most of my life). I begged my parents for years to take me to get diagnosed, they refused. They told me it was just hormones, puberty, it was normal. They would yell at me for doing compulsions and tell me to stop being silly. 

As a result I hid my compulsions and didn't talk about it, it got worse and worse. I'd stay up till 4am every night doing compulsions, hearing my parents snoring and resenting them. I'd be terrified of them waking up and finding out I'm not in bed and punishing me, I'd hate them for not taking me seriously. I'd go to school with 2 or 3 hours of sleep. I'd fall asleep in lessons, not write any notes. I'd cross over my writing during exams and rewrite the same sentence over 20 times. I was silently begging for help and no one noticed, none of the teachers or my friends. After a while my brother finally noticed and begged my parents to take me to a therapist as well. My mum finally agreed and took me to get diagnosed without my dad's approval. 

I was diagnosed a few days after I turned 14 and was told I need ERP CBT. I was put on the waiting list for CAMHS services. Then nothing else happened. I scored 34 on the Y-BOCS. 

My mum got me a private therapist for a bit when I was 15, but she had to stop because she said she wasn't qualified enough for me. She suggested I seek an autism diagnosis too. 

At age 16 I was diagnosed autistic. 

I also have ME/CFS (diagnosed aged 10). 

My OCD got so severe to the point that I couldn't write, read or do basic things. I stopped attending school. The last time I went to school was over two years ago (15 years old). No one apart from my parents noticed or cared that I was missing more and more school each week. My parents only cared about the fact that I was missing school and education. They'd tell at me to go to school because otherwise I'd never get into uni and I'd be a failure. My parents are both highly educated and expect the same from me. They didn't care that I was suicidal, they wanted me to go to school and get an education. They only stopped shouting at me to go to school after I attempted suicide. Then they focused on getting me into therapy so I could go back to school as soon as possible. 

My parents got me prescribed antidepressants from a different country, since the UK doesn't give a shit about me. After a few months CAMHS continued my medication with a psychiatrist, but no therapy. I told them I was suicidal and they did nothing. 

I've been on 7 different antidepressants. 
I'm now on 150mg of Sertraline, which reduces suicidal thoughts, but doesn't help with OCD. 

I've been on the CAMHS waiting list for 4 years, but have now been kicked off because I just turned 18. I need to start from scratch, reapply to adult services through my GP and go to the bottom of the waiting list. 

As of now I spend 8+ hours just on physical compulsions. Even more time is spent on obsessions. 

I've been to over 15 different therapists/psychologists. I had sessions with a specialist in OCD, he had to stop our sessions since I wasn't progressing. 

I have treatment resistant OCD and don't know what to do. 

The UK healthcare system has completely neglected me. With my physical health and my mental health. 

I don't know what to do. Idk if there is hope. What is the point. 
I have so many physical problems too (POTS and suspected EDS, though not officially diagnosed with EDS). 

My life is shit. I'm in physical pain all the time anyway. I can't do any hobbies. I love playing violin, but have a hand deformity which makes it extremely difficult for me to progress. 

What's the point in recovery from OCD. What's the point in living. I've tried CBT a few times before, I put all my energy into it. I tried so hard. And it failed multiple times. I no longer have the energy to try again, whatever compulsion I manage to get rid off, it somehow ends up getting replaced with 3 new compulsions. 

Are there other options to treat OCD? Is there something else? Idk what to do. I'm so fucking tired. My family have let me down. The healthcare system has let me down. I have so much resentment towards the world, I have no desire to live here. ",1755012869.0,1,2,OCD,ocd

1mo0sr4,"My relationship is triggering me so badly, and I’m terrified I’m going to ruin it","Long post ahead, so thank yall for reading in advance 🫠 I’m just really needing support (not reassurance) and just wanting to find people who have been through something similar and have found ways to get through it. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with my boyfriend, and I’m terrified. I know some people are lucky finding a partner with utmost patience and understanding and are able to work with their OCD or see right through it, but at the same time I feel like you can’t expect that from everyone, even someone who really loves you because at some point it’s not fair for them.

My OCD and anxiety are at an all time high in my relationship right now (I also have severe ADHD, terrible combination). I’m 25, he’s 26, and I knew instantly this relationship was different than any one I’ve ever experienced and I FINALLY got all of the things and the type of love I had been longing for from the right person, and we connected in ways I never had with anyone. The standard was set SUPER high from the jump because we have been long distance since the start and everything was perfect especially being long distance. We were on the same page with everything - for the first time in my life I didn’t ever feel like I was asking for too much, never felt like I wanted more attention than he wanted to give, and he prioritized me the way I’ve always felt like I needed. I felt secure in ways I had never felt before and that was saying something considering we were long distance immediately and long distance usually causes security issues.. it all felt so perfect because as you can guess, nothing was triggering me 🫠 Naturally as a relationship goes on, things aren’t always going the be the exact same every single time you expect them to be (as a person with OCD), and he set the standard super high in the beginning which some may call the honeymoon phase, which set me up for a severe OCD dumpster fire in the future, and here we are. Change triggers me, him doing something slightly different or less affectionate than he did before triggers a spiral of wondering if he still wants to be with me, which causes immediate images in my head of him talking to other girls behind my back, being intimate with other girls or wanting to be intimate with other girls (sometimes when we’re FaceTiming and I’m feeling triggered I will literally look at his face and picture him being with other girls) I can’t let go of arguments or things he said that bothered me until I feel like he TRULY understands, apologizes with genuine empathy, or we resolve it. I can't just walk away from the convo, it HAS to be resolved or else I can’t go back to normal. Otherwise I will keep ruminating about it for days/weeks. If he doesn’t respond perfectly in a way that makes me feel like he truly understands, I don’t feel like it’s solved. I will rehearse/type out what I want to say to him when I need him to understand something  out of fear of leaving something out or not explaining perfectly. All of this then turns into me thinking he’s not the right person for me because he can’t meet all of my unrealistic expectations consistently. I spend 90% of my time ruminating about my relationship. 

I could go on and on, but I’m just really needing advice here. It’s a constant battle between feeling valid in needing things to be solved immediately or fixed immediately, to then feeling severe guilt and like I’m actually the problem. This disease is terrible and already affects my day to day life, I don’t need it destroying my relationship. I want to have genuine understanding that realistically, he’s not always going to react with utmost affection and excitement, and I want to have genuine patience with him and give him real space to work on whatever is bothering me, but it’s so hard when I’m having a constant battle in my head.

1mnp3xv,OCD totally ruined my life.,"Hello everyone,
I want to ask about something. I’m struggling with existential OCD, although I haven’t been officially diagnosed yet. But I have an important question.

My emotions feel like something is blocking them from coming out. 


When I think about something, do something, or imagine something, and my emotions start to appear, Or I say something or someone says something to me or I read or hear anything this applies to everything I feel throughout the day this is what happens—the OCD tells me that my thoughts, my feelings, and everything in my mind are wrong.



1. Every time I start to feel something, the existential thoughts I usually think about pop up.

2. When I begin to feel something, I also remember how I used to be before these thoughts started. Then I feel sad that I no longer experience emotions like before, and my feelings get cut off as soon as they start to come out.

3. This is the most painful part whenever I feel something, my mind tells me that my feeling is wrong, that I shouldn’t feel that way. And here’s the harder question: do we, as humans, actually experience the same emotions in the same way?

4. There are feelings that I can’t even describe, that happen throughout the day different from love or hate. Feelings like sensing your own value, or the meaning in the things you do. Certain situations have their own unique emotional flavor.My mind forces me not to feel them, because I don’t know whether others feel them too or not.

5. My mind constantly tortures me with the idea that I give myself too much value, and it blocks me with this question:
Before these thoughts, I used to love myself, my achievements, and everything I did or thought about. I encouraged myself for even the smallest things, even at home. I could spend the rest of the day feeling proud of myself, and that pride helped me keep going. Whenever I remembered that I was a good, calm person who loved my qualities, even recalling how I acted in situations years ago would give me confidence in the present.
That wasn’t arroganceit was just being mentally healthy back then.

Now my mind tells me that all those feelings and thoughts were wrong.

At the same time, I envy people who don’t go through this, because I know logically that they feel all kinds of emotions, while my mind stops me from feeling them.

I’ve reached a point where I don’t know how to continue my day or my life, because I no longer feel the sense of accomplishment or love that used to give me the push to keep going.

I want advice or to hear from someone who’s been through this about what they did.
And is it true that everything we experience in life has its own unique taste and emotional feeling?

Thank you for reading.

1mo2g79,Does ERP really work?,"I know ERP is supposedly be the golden standard for OCD, but recently I've benn having some doubts. You're supposed to tell everyone to resist compulsions but when I look at this subreddit for example I mostly see people venting how horrible this diesease is (which it is) despite trying multiple times to manage it, instead of improvements.

In most succes stories I read, I rarely see people praising ERP on how great it is, even people who say it's worked out for them, a lot of times it's just temporary or they're in denial.

The common agreement is that OCD isn't fully curable, but it's manageable enough to live a normal life with. What does that mean exactly? If I have some bad and some good days, and even on the good days I have just a little anxiety, that would be acceptable for me. However I'm starting to be afraid that ""you can live a normal life with OCD"" only means means that you can pefectly mimic being normal while on the inside you still have all the anxiety.

Yesterday I took the conscious effort to stop doing my compulsions and stop ruminating and I feel horrible. I have this anxiety, everything irritates me, I'm fatigued, I want to crawl my bain out, I don't know how to live like this.  My thoughts are jumbled up, I feel like I have to let go of my core values and beliefs without even knowing what can I hold on to and I don't even know what's compulsion or not or whether I'm really resistiong them or just making myself numb to not feel it. I don't even know what to believe and feel. The issue is thaere were days when I wasn't actively resisitng compulsions, yet I still felt good and had little anxiety, I could have easily lived my life the way I did on those days. Right now though my problem is that I don't have any positive experiences to offset the negative ones which I feel like you need to function normally.

1mnvgud,Anyone have obsessions they genuinely don’t know wtf to do about,"
Not the happiest stream of consciousness, but I want to know if anyone has dealt with anything similar? 

TW for hoarding if that’s something you don’t want to read about rn


But does anyone deal with obsessions that they just don’t even know how to think about? I have always been scared of hoarding as a concept, I think because my dad used to say that hoarders are disgusting. I don’t know why he brought it up so often. There’s a lot to unpack there, but I’m gonna skip past it, because my dad is the same person that told me he “used to have OCD, but grew out of it.” 

Obviously adult me understands that hoarding is a mental illness, not something that makes an individual disgusting. Just like how I’m not gross for the days I used to scratch at my tonsils until they bled because I was worried about what might be in them. Illness is gross and scary like that ig. 

Anyhow, since I learned about the relationship between OCD and hoarding, I have been obsessed with hoarding. Every time I’m getting rid of stuff, there’s this voice in my head telling me to do it so that I do not become a hoarder. Like obviously yeah, get rid of the stuff you need to, but it’s like this “loud” and urgent sense of “get rid of it NOW or you won’t be able to” rather than just… being able to throw something away and not be anxious that I can’t get that done. I don’t think getting a visceral wave of fear of being unable to separate myself from the garbage I’m throwing away whenever I’m discarding something is exactly healthy. So then I’m stuck in this loop of being obsessed with “what if one day, I can’t let go of the garbage anymore,” and I throw it away, because that’s what I wanted to do from the start, but also, it feels like I’m giving into a compulsion? I’m not suggesting I should keep my garbage, but because of this weird wave of anxiety about hoarding, it feels the same as when I act on a compulsion? I’ve never even struggled with hoarding before, now I’m just worried that one day I’ll become inseparable from things that should not be here. I just feel really silly for struggling with this feedback loop so bad. I’ve been managing my symptoms for a LONG time and idek how to approach this.

1mnyu08,Has anyone else experienced a fear of “personified harm”?,"When I was first diagnosed with OCD as a kid, I got sent to a child psychologist who tried to explain OCD and anxiety as a “worry monster”—something that I understand to be a pretty common exercise with kids. 

It makes sense: if done well, it’s a good way to introduce kids to the idea of intrusive thoughts. “You are not your thoughts” is a powerful idea to someone who’s never thought about it. You have them draw out their anxiety to show what it feels like. However, to no fault of this therapist, this idea TERRIFIED me to the point that we looked for someone else.

It took a while before I was sort of able to explain it. The idea that something autonomous/conscious was literally inside me and existed to scare/hurt me filled me with this sense of helplessness and terror. While I rationally knew there was no real “OCD monster” it scared the shit out of me. 

I’m an adult now, but other things from when I was a kid had the same effect on me: pest control commercials with talking bugs, Mucinex and Lamisil ads, Allstate Mayhem ads, specific episodes of Arthur and Curious George, and the movie Osmosis Jones are all examples. It filled me with this sense of dread—the mental image of some invisible, unstoppable militia that took pleasure in my suffering. 

Now, it’s mostly gone. I consider it to be a extension of my contamination OCD, among other things. While ERP has really helped me with this specific theme, I’ve always wondered—has anyone else had a similar experience? The fear of an anthropomorphic version of contamination is something I’ve never really heard anyone talk about.

I do think i have GAD but i also thought i would have OCD. for over a year now i've been experiencing intrusive thoughts about my sexuality (im lesbian) and they almost feel like they aren't my own. it's like, even thought i know what i want and who i want, my thoughts tell me the exact opposite of that. i find myself ignoring things with romance, not being able to read books i love bc theres a straight couple in it and i dont want it to trigger me, not being able to watch ppl kiss in movies bc it makes me overthink. overall this has caused me a lot of chronic pain which us what lead me to see a psychologist. when he told me i had GAD i was so shocked i didn't know what to say. i was so ready for him to just say ""you have OCD"" that to hear soemthing else felt wrong and even angering. is it possible that I have both?

1mnnq93,Is it common to have sexual trauma fixations?,"Hi, I am not diagnosed with OCD but I suspect I may have it. I have a lot of thoughts that take over my whole life but the most common fixation I get involves my past SA trauma. I always thought I just had severe anxiety but it feels so much more intense than that. I get triggered very easily by things around me that have nothing to do with it, like I will be at work and see something, start thinking about random stuff, and then eventually the longer I think it always loops back around to my SA. These thoughts are genuinely ruining my life right now and no matter how happy I am I can't stop it. I feel like it has been messing up my current relationship and I feel so bad. 

((I'm basically just going on a rant from here below so don't read this if you don't want lol))

Even before my first relationship I always had this idea that the person I had my first kiss with and first time with was gonna be the person I spent the rest of my life with (and vice versa, I would be their first). My first relationship was full of manipulation and my first time was SA, so naturally this fucked me up beyond repair and I know I have not fully healed even though I feel like I've gotten over it for the most part. In my current relationship me and my partner are eachother's ""firsts"" (I dont like to count my past relationship,  since it wasn't consensual.. this helps me cope a lot so dont be mean)(also my current partner knows abt my past) and it was fine at first but as we started getting intimate I had so much anxiety because he told me he had viewed adult content before and I was scared how he would see me and if he was comparing me to what he had seen :( I love myself and I think I'm beaitiful but that kind of content is always airbrushed and fake so y'know... anyway I still struggle with this a lot even though I know how much my bf loves me. I know he would never cheat on me but those thoughts won't stop eating away at me and I get scared that I will have them for the rest of my life. The whole idea of sex makes me feel disgusted with myself for some reason idk why. I feel like I cant talk about this with anyone irl because every time I do everyone just think I have jealousy issues or something of that sort, but it's so much deeper than that. I just have anxiety about how accessible pornography is and it just disgusts me so much and I feel bad about it. I know its normal to look at that stuff but it makes me feel sick. The fear of my partner looking at it makes me feel so upset, especially with how easily it appears online. I get ads and stuff all the time that are sexual and I dont even look at anything remotely suggestive online. Every time I see something that reminds me of adult content, it genuinely ruins my day and I get horrible intrusive thoughts. It's especially bad because one if my biggest triggers is big boobs (I knkw it sounds stupid lol) which sucks because my boobs are big 😭😭 There was even a time when I was triggered so bad I didn't take a shower for days because I didn't feel comfortable seeing myself naked. I'm so sorry if this is TMI but I just had to get it off my chest because no one seems to understand.

1mnrxjr,Rabies OCD conflicting medical advice,"I made a post the other day about how a bat almost flew into my face while jogging at night. I didn't feel it touch me but then I started second guessing myself and found a tiny scratch and just spiraling in general. I am 100% sure it was a bat though. I called my local county public health line and they told me I am going to be fine and I don't really need the shot. Then I called a different county to get another opinion and they had the complete opposite reaction. They said I have to go to the ER immediately. I don't have active insurance right now and I can't afford this so now I am completely spiraling. I can't trust myself because of my OCD and now I don't even know what advice to listen to. How can the medical professionals have a complete opposite opinion? My insurance hasn't kicked in yet and I am about to leave the country. I honestly can't cope with this right now. It's all I can think about. I have barely even worked or done anything else since this happened. I am living in an endless nightmare.

  
UPDATE: I think I am not going to get the shots. I am still anxious about it but I am going to try to just not think about it. I did not actually feel the bat touch me and bats can't bite you while they are flying they would have to land on me to bite me which definitely didn't happen. I did have a tiny scratch and I guess it could have scratched me while flying, but I think rationally I would have felt the wings or more of the bat hit me. I don't think it is rational that only its claw would have touched me and I didn't notice anything else, especially because I had this rabies fear about bats before this even happened, so if it had actually touched me there is no way I wouldn't have noticed. Bat people also say that bats don't actually scratch people very easily because their claws are in like a hook shape. Also it was flying around at night with a lot of other bats which means it was acting normal and probably didn't have rabies even if it touched me. I guess the odds are not zero, but I think I have more of a chance of dying in a plane crash or lightning strike at this point so it is not worth the hassle of getting expensive shots and dealing with this while I'm supposed to be enjoying a vacation.

1mnl7wt,Good OCD Representation,"Hello friends,

I have been recently diagnosed and wanted to shout-out OCD representation as a major reason why I even knew something was wrong to begin with. For the longest time I've had the incredibly wrong impression that all OCD manifests itself as the classic Contamination OCD or Just Right. I had no idea what obsessions sounded like in your head or how compulsions manifested and so on. It wasn't until I read a book in which the protagonist had OCD, written by an author with firsthand experience, that I realized it was more than that.

So to that end, what is your favorite representation of OCD? Any and all forms of art and media, please. I'd love good books (fiction and nonfiction) to read, movies to watch, games to play, music to listen to, art to look at, and so on! Any misrepresentations to avoid would also be greatly appreciated as I learn what it means to have OCD.

My recommendations
- Book - How to Hide in Plain Sight by Emma Noyes - Fiction book that follows a woman going back home for her brother's wedding after years away from her family. She thinks she is prepared but finds the nostalgia and reminders of her childhood are much harder on her OCD than anticipated. This was the first time I had ever seen OCD as anything other than Contamination and Just Right and had realized that the way my thoughts sound might be drastically different than the ""norm.""

- Book - Turtles All the Way Down by John Green - A classic, popular book that I had no idea was about OCD. I just knew John Green as a popular author (and youtuber). My themes aren't close, but I think how he writes Aza's thought spirals is very illuminating.

1mnvtp5,A diagnosis I wasn’t expecting…,"Hi all!
Anyone else get diagnosed with OCD, and was surprised? I’m almost 40 and I have always been like this. 

I have always noticed everything, played and replayed and replayed conversations. My whole life I have joked I have a rational brain and irrational brain, and my irrational brain is the worst because it talks too much. My parents thought I had a great memory growing up, but in reality I felt responsible for people having a good time. I still feel like if I come off as forgetful, people will have a bad time, hate me and I would die alone. I’ve ruminated for days on end without sleep. 

I was an ICU nurse for a long time and I think that is why I never noticed. To be praised for remembering everything, being hypervigilant. Part of my job was to make everyone feel seen and special. Of course I would obsess about not killing people and death because I would be around it all the time. I saw a therapist for three years because he said this was depression and self loathing. I’m seeing someone new and they were surprised I went my whole life without a diagnosis (as are many of my friends in the mental health field that never felt comfortable confronting me about it). 

I feel a little happy and sad with this diagnosis. Like, I wish I would have gotten here sooner, but I am relieved that I can gain appropriate skills to live with this. Hopefully quiet my irrational brain a little. It has started affecting my confidence in making friends. That’s why I need to work on this. 

How about ya’ll? How do you feel about your diagnosis. Have you had it a long time or are you just finding out? ",1754963135.0,1,1,OCD,ocd

1mnd6sv,Shout-out & special thanks to r/OCD,"You guys are the best.

This is my first post here ever, but the support you've shown each other has been really supportive to me too.

Over the last couple years, I developed (what I *think* is) a compulsion, specifically needing to check my door.
I would remember locking it but it wasnt enough, I **had** to check at least twice.
Even if I had already made it to the car, down the street, or whatever, if the thought occurred that maybe I didn't actually lock it, I had to turn around. I tried fighting it at first but I didnt get physically far enough where it felt like I couldn't just turn around to check anyway.
Slowly, it devolved into needing to check immediately, then turn back around in the driveway then stopping at the street to run back up the driveway to check and ask someone if I locked the door.

Even though it was no extreme damper, I wasn't working, and I never wasted anything more than 30m at a time because it only ever happened when I was leaving the house, I still decided something wasnt right. I can be very anxious but I'm not normally this overwhelmed.

I’m still not 100% sure if this is a true compulsion or just a new element rooted in my GAD, but getting the advice that I actually needed to *stop* reassuring helped a lot in decreasing the checking. It gave me something to hold on to so I didnt feel like I was underreacting to a potential issue.
Now, I just twist the handle once to make sure its locked and I can just leave. I still think about it and it still pops up with new doors that I have some responsibility for making sure they're locked but again, not as stressful as it used to be.

Regardless, I’m currently in the process of finding a new therapist and psychiatrist for my other conditions (GAD, ADHD, MDD) so if anyone has any advice on finding the right therapist and/or psychiatrist to address that additional concern, it would be appreciated!

You guys can't see how much you've helped me but it is so so so appreciated. Thanks again 🩵",1754919415.0,10,0,OCD,ocd
1mnq2ty,"Daughter has severe OCD and husband doesn't want to ""cater"" to her needs...","So, both my husband and I have had OCD in childhood, and I personally still deal with it, but I'm medicated and my symptoms are slight now.

My 13 year old daughter started progressively showing symptoms the last year or so. She has pretty bad contamination OCD, she over washes her hands and uses her sleeves whenever possible to avoid using her hands so she needs to wash less. It is definitely effecting her everyday life. 

She started therapy at the beginning of summer. We are not anti medication, but wanted to try talk therapy and see how that faired first. It's actually going okay, slow, as expected, but well.

School is coming up in the next couple weeks, so we were talking about some things that might be stressors for her. One of her major stressors is noise. She comes home *stressed* out on assembly days, or even just after a particularly loud day at school or on the bus. These kids really are loud. I don't blame her, she's texted me videos begging me to come get her from school. 

She's also a straight A student and in accelerated classes. She's in 8th and will be going to high school next year. 

She has me in the therapy room. I stay quiet unless asked a question and have tried to encourage her to do solo, but she always declines. She does not want her dad in the room, but has had him in the room for special incidents. 

I offhandly said, when asked if I thought there might be a solution, that maybe there was a smaller school we could look into. I specified that I didn't even know if there were any available, and I hadn't done any research at all. There will be thousands of kids in the high school, way more than in the school she's at now.

The therapist thought it was a great idea and offered to do some research too.

I briefed my husband on the session (daughter is 100% ok with this), and he was immediately negative about it. First, saying there are none available. I said, how would you even know, we haven't done research at all. Then, you didn't consult me. I can understand this, but I was asked a question, I didn't make any permanent decisions, was just throwing stuff out there to improve my kid's quality of life. Then, if we do this, we will be indulging her OCD and basically just ""feeding"" it and making it worse. 

His father had it, and again, he ""had"" it, and their way of ""getting rid"" of it was just to push it away and forget about it. 

I told him that the therapist agreed and said if it was possible, that sounded like a great idea. He called me a liar, I said kid was in the session and heard it too 🙄

So, can I get some opinions here? Is making accommodations for her ocd essentially ""feeding"" her ocd and making it worse?

Honestly, so far, we haven't really made any allowances, other than her not wanting to be touched. Which I personally do not see as an ""allowance"", her body, if she doesn't want to be hugged or touched, she shouldn't be.

Please give me some advice.",1754948384.0,2,17,OCD,ocd

So my family has a history mental health health issues. My brother went through this OCD scrupulosity for four years. I really don’t understand how he went through all this. I just started this about two weeks ago. And I feel like I’m going to break my head. I think it all started from a comment someone made about my job. I work at a defense Company, as an intern, someone made this comment bothered me really bad. He said I could never work out of the defense company due to his conscience. With that, I started overthinking my killing people. Am I part of a company that is known for doing things that is not of the Lord; than on top that, I started going down a whirlpool, more obsessive, thoughts such as I’m graduating. This fall, and I cheated almost all of college. Do I have the right to use this degree? By using this degree am I lying to the employers? Maybe I should I just drop my degree & do some blue collar work, it’s not like I like the office type of work. Now I’ve convinced myself I’m going to hell. I even made a breakthrough for a bit because I was getting really close to God, and I know the enemy is attacking me, but yet, I am just allowing myself to feel the feeling of damnation that I will never be normal.

I love her so much and I don’t want to leave her and I know she has a mental health issues and she’s taking some medication that’s helping around.

We are scheduled to go for vacation on Saturday. We have a cat, and my parents were supposed to house sit. Now, they most likely can’t because they also have a dog and we don’t want to risk exposure.

Anyways, the fleas have made me feel so gross. To the point, we went out for dinner last night, and my relationship/retroactive jealousy didn’t get triggered ONCE! lol that’s a serious feat for me. On the downside, I couldn’t help but think of all the fleas crawling on my skin, I’m constantly checking myself and my dog for fleas. I’ve jumped to the worst case scenario that we already have an infestation and this will take YEARS to solve. My head feels so tingling and I’m seriously on the verge of crying. We also will probably have to cancel our trip happening in less than a week. Oh and I’m obviously googling and going on Reddit for answers (throwback to when I had health anxiety!!!!)

1mnlcly,Options for OCD diagnosis and treatment?,"Hey guys, 

For the past several years (24F) I have struggled heavily with what I thought was anxiety ""relapses"" . I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and ADHD at different points in my life and currently take 10mg of Trintillex and 20mg of Vyvanse. 

Anyway these ""relapses"" involve insanely intrusive thoughts, thoughts about contamination (someone put THC in food not prepared by me, or touching something that had fentanyl and will cause an OD), thoughts/fear that I am developing schizophrenia or psychosis (despite not ever having symptoms of them), and repetitive thoughts and imagery of loved ones dying/passing that leaves me very emotionally upset.

Having these thoughts like one time isn't necessarily a problem as one can't control intrusive thoughts, BUT I get stuck in loops of these thoughts/ ""relapses"" that can last hours/days/weeks and there's very little I can do to escape them!!! It feels like mental torture. To the point that I've actually wanted to bang my head against the wall to make them stop... Its left me with panic attacks, a constant pit in my stomach, and borderline agoraphobia (however, I fight it everyday, still leave my house on a daily basis and push myself to drive out a town despite having insane fear about it).

I do not have any physical OCD attributes. It's purely thought patterns, and having other thoughts patterns to counteract the negative ones. Which I think is why it's gone under the radar and undiagnosed, since I've been in therapy and seeing my DR.

This is the first time I've ever written let alone said or told anyone about a lot of this... 

I know no one here can diagnose, but what would you recommend with your lived experience of OCD? Am I right to be concerned about having it, and should I seek medical help (medication changes?) to soothe some symptoms? Or does medication even help?

This is because what they didn't take into account is suicides. People of any age might be going through stuff that they might need help for but can't get the help because ""they aren't 18"". Things like people of any age with schizophrenia, ocd, depression, stress, sexually abused (or abused physically or mentally) and can't go to someone because they might be scared that something even worse might happen to them or in the case of ocd they might have it so severe to the point that they might want to just end it but can't get the help because they are not 18. 

The suicide rates were already going up but now they might drastically go up because people might not be able to get the help or support that they might be seeking to feel like not ending it.

There is already on a subreddit ( i remember seeing a post from a subreddit about mental issues or something like that) a lot of people complaining about the new shitty laws and how it has affected them drastically already.

1mnl8on,Academic Stuff,"There’s a more eloquent way to phrase that but anyway.

I am a university student. I’m currently doing a MLitt and I am two weeks away from my final dissertation submission. I also did a HNC and an Open University course before my undergrad degree.

Since I began further/higher education, my OCD has been fixated on academic integrity, plagiarism, collusion etc. Everyone hates referencing but it is the bane of my academic existence, my brain goes overboard and I obsessively reference and footnote to the point that my bibliographies (at least during my undergrad) could be as long as the piece of work I was submitting.

I think I overdo it (I assume it’s the OCD), and other people also imply that I worry too much about it, but until my MLitt nobody could explain how to reference less in a way I understood.

For my undergrad I studied English; for my MLitt I am doing Creative Writing. At my uni the referencing system for Creative Writing is different from English in that you only need to list the sources you have directly quoted from rather than all the sources you’ve used.

I couldn’t have done an MLitt in English with their referencing it would have driven me nuts. 

I also just generally worry about the standard of my work, and with every piece of work I have a panic that I can’t do it and I want to give up. Today for academic integrity reasons, I wanted to give up on the MLitt, but as usual my supervisor says I am overthinking, so I guess I’d better get on with it.

Just wondered if anyone else’s OCD manifests in this way?

Another think that bothers me is that, however difficult I find academia for the above reasons, I am apparently good at it and might like to go further (PhD), particularly as perhaps an academic career is a possibility for me. (I feel I’m no good at anything else and I made a previous post here about my difficulties with employment and feelings around this).

But I don’t think (the way my brain has been during the MLitt) that I could hack a PhD, and that’s upsetting.

Generally my OCD makes almost everything difficult and I don’t know how I’m going to progress in life once I stop being a student.

I’m having a major issue. I generally avoid really upsetting things on social media and have all these tags blocked regarding things that will cause me to spiral (true crime, news, things like that). My current problem is I keep getting videos of people in Gaza looking for donations and they ask if you can’t donate (which I’m unable to rn) that you comment, like, save, share so that it’ll help the algorithm and they’ll get more views. But seeing this stuff is extremely hard for me. But then if I skip it I feel like a terrible terrible person. I obsess over how I’m selfish and choosing my own comfort over helping others. So I’ll scroll back and comment, like, share, save the video. Then I just keep getting the videos like that, and it’s like literally every 5 videos. If I avoid the videos I obsess over being a bad person, if I watch the videos I obsess over the atrocities and I can’t stop thinking about starving children and my own kids being in that position and I just feel horrified and sad and depressed.

1mmo10r,Ocd + Autism is a mess together,"For me,
Ocd is when your interests become too much worry.
Autism is when your interests become too much input, even if you want to engage in them.
Since engaging in hobbies has been easily exhausting me due to burnout, I have reasons to worry about them being ruined by stress and overwhelm, because interests are crazy personal and important to me. I thought the stress was a sign of boredom but it hasnt always been the case, i could be focused without boredom on an interest and still feel tense cause the interest is still too much to handle. Living with both ocd and autism is a nightmare and there should be a sub for those living with both.

1mnbvjh,Existential OCD,"Has any of you ever dealt with existential OCD? I've been dealing with this for a couple of weeks and of all my OCD themes it's been the hardest to manage - at least for me. I've had tons of health OCD during my life, but I've always managed to keep it all under control. This is... really on another level. I suffer from DPDR on a daily basis, so I was already struggling with sense of reality and sense of self to begin with. Then I read about solipsism. It sent me in a pit of despair. For those reading who don't know what solipsism is **trigger warning**, it's this idea that we can't really prove that other people and the world around us are real, since we only know the world and the others around us through our own perceptions. The idea that the world around me and the people around me might not be real, combined with DPDR, have sent me in the darkest spiral I've ever been. I don't know how to get rid of this OCD theme. When I have health related OCD I generally go to the doctor and that's enough to calm me down. If I have relationship OCD, I check in with my partner and I'm able to calm down. But I can't calm down from existential OCD, because nobody has the answers to this.

1mn5uws,Having a mom with OCD,"TW: SA

My mom has OCD (as well as myself). she thinks she “fixed” it because she went to therapy and did CBT for about a year. 😭 In reality, her symptoms just shifted. She used to have mostly compulsions, and now it’s purely obsessive. She has intense religious fears that she bases her entire life around, and she also bases her emotional state on her kids. If we’re mentally and physically okay, then she’s okay.

But if we’re not okay, in any sense?

I can’t really be myself at home. And it feels wrong to even say that, because I love her and she loves me so much. But her “empathy” turns into dependency. Any emotion I have, she feels ten times harder, and it becomes my job to manage her reaction and spill out everything I have to reassure her.

For example: a few weeks ago, I was extremely stressed about whether to get a restraining order against my SAer, plus I’d been unemployed for two months despite trying hard to find work (mental health and other factors make this really difficult). I hadn’t slept in almost 48 hours because I’d been having a two-day anxiety attack. I told her all of this, and instead of supporting my decision, she kept pushing me not to get the restraining order-ONLY because it was stressing me out therefore stressing her, not for any logical reason.

When I said I needed to go to my room to calm down, she started crying, yelling, and begging me not to leave things “like this.” I reassured her I was safe but just emotional and didn’t want to argue from pure emotion. Then my dad (who yells whenever anyone is upset) got involved, and things escalated. My mom and I ended up fighting the entire day-on top of everything else I was already dealing with. I literally hate fighting with her

This is what I mean when I say her OCD isn’t “gone” it just shows up differently now, and I end up carrying the weight of it.

I appreciate how much she cares and she only has good intentions, but I wish she would go to therapy. She is thinking about it (after lightly mentioning it many times and many arguments afterwards)",1754894685.0,3,2,OCD,ocd

1mmz9w4,I dropped out of university due to my OCD,"Two weeks ago I took the fearful decision of dropping out of university after realising how much of my life has been consumed by my OCD.

I believed that I had to make my studies my entire life or else i would forget was i was learning about, felt like I had to be studying all the time or else I wasn’t ever going to be good enough to get a job in science, doing things until it feels just right but nothing ever feels right because what if \_\_. This was further exacerbated by me trying to use AI during studying to double check what i was doing, which led to more uncertainty due to me double checking its responses as well as my own understanding. It was extremely draining and during all of this I didn’t want to believe I had OCD despite three doctors telling me I had it because I thought that if i accepted I had OCD that I would get it and never recover from it. I lied to myself and to medical health professionals thinking that I was creating my dream life when I was really struggling.

For context this all started 5 years ago when my friend taught me about manifestation and I took it to the extreme of changing so many parts of myself and believing that our mind creates our reality and all of that stuff. I have ADHD (was undiagnosed at the time) and believed my inability to focus was because I was dumb, so I essentially started to believe I was smart and to me this meant I had to study all of the time. The strong belief in manifestation that I had caused me immense anxiety and stress around intrusive thoughts I would have and situations involving uncertainty.

I would convince myself of things to stay ’motivated’ which was actually me just stressing myself out coupled with intrusive thoughts. I ended up doing extremely well in my studies but could not feel any accomplishment or joy from the awards I got because I was constantly trying to find ways to improve and get better. Constantly checking if I was doing things right etc. OCD affects all areas of my life but this has been the most prominent for me.

Please seek help if you need it and have the option. I have had the opportunity to have help for my OCD for many years and i refused to take it because of how strong my obsessions and compulsions were. 5 years of my life have been essentially controlled by my OCD and uncertainty and I am only now choosing to get the help I need.",1754873592.0,4,0,OCD,ocd

Every single day, I go over over and over in my head and check to see if I'm turning out like her, check to see if I was mean to that one person or if I bragged too much or if I judged someone.

Ever since I was 8, almost 9 I have been struggling with OCD. In my childhood, I felt out of place due to the thoughts and feelings I had. I was also raised Christian too, so as a child I was afraid I was sinning when I had certain intrusive thoughts. I even would bring it up about the thoughts bothering me, but was brushed off because mental health was looked as a ""spirit"" or ""sin"" growing up. So, I always thought I was in the wrong for having certain thoughts and anxiety. I would even pray the thoughts away, but they would always come back. I was also told to pray against the thoughts, so when they came back I thought I was sinning or not believing enough. I also feared punishment from God due to my OCD. Just to be clear, I still believe I am still a Christian, but I block out toxic rhetoric that is anti mental health. I don't think God is angry with me for struggling with OCD. I also don't think God is against taking care of your mental health either. I'm thankful I have answers to how I have been feeling. It is a relief to find out what is wrong and to feel validated.

I feel like in some ways I’ve gotten better mentally. However, this is the part that I’m really struggling with. 
If im really stressed, for example, stressed with my work or stressed with my animals being crazy/hyper one day, etc.. my brain automatically goes “see life is stressful and not worth living”. Like I need to be in constant joy for me to feel like life is meaningful. Another example, my husband is VERY stressed with his car/job and many many other things. He complains a lot how stressed he is.. this is triggering me so bad it’s insane. I keep asking him “do you even think life is worth living for if we’re always stressed”. He doesn’t even understand how I could think that. My mind constantly is monitoring my emotions, which has caused depression. I got some suicidal ocd and my mind was obsessing on my depressive thoughts and I was scared that I might need to go inpatient because I couldn’t handle it all. I worry one day I won’t be able to take it all and I’ll have to admit myself.

The year I turned 13 in response to a traumatic situation it quickly developed beyond that and spiraled out of control. It took over my life for years with everyone in my life thinking it would never get better. It was extreme contamination ocd, with moral ocd as  well. It only got better around two years ago (I'm 19 now for reference) And it was so so relieving to be out of it. Recently I started adhd meds (stimulants) and my ocd started to run a bit rampant, than I switched to a type that released slower and it got better for a while. But then it started again, when it gets too bad I take a break from my adhd meds and the ocd is still more there than it was prior to starting the meds but it is more manageable.  The problem is I need the adhd meds to function as I have pretty bad adhd and they work super well for my adhd. My ocd when it came back was a whole new type I had never experienced before, health ocd, and somehow it feels more miserable than anything I've ever experienced. I have an important test in the morning and I can't fall asleep because I am so anxious about my health. Something happened that is leading me to believe I will die promptly, and I cant calm down.

I brought it up to my mom recently and she got scared and said I have to talk to my therapist abt it.. obviously that was a huge trigger seeing as I struggle with fears of schizophrenia, etc. it felt very judgy, like she was afraid of me, and it made me rlly question if this is at all normal.

1mmmk68,Finally found a strategy which is working for me. Wanted to share with you all in case it works for you,"Just a little bit of introduction about me. I have been suffering with OCD for years. My OCD types include Religious OCD, excessively washing hands, making sure objects are in the correct order, thinking something bad will happen (like a terminal disease) if I don't perform a certain action, checking for grammatical correctness in every mail or comment I write and checking things multiple times from what I can recall right now.

Today suddenly an idea popped into my mind and I came up with this strategy to beat my OCD and I am really happy it seems to be working. Let me share.

There are 2 parts of OCD
1. The intrusive thoughts (not in your control)
2. The compulsions you do (in your control but very difficult to avoid doing)

Divide your OCD into the above two parts.

Now completely forget about the 1st part (the intrusive thoughts)

Let's focus on the 2nd part

Here's the strategy you can adopt. Tell yourself that you will act how a normal person (who doesn't have OCD) will act. Basically you will emulate a normal person.

Anytime you get the urge to do a compulsion or you are in the middle of doing your compulsions/rituals, ask 'What would a normal person without OCD do in this situation?'. You do that.

You can even refer to someone you know who doesn't have OCD. Let's say you know someone called David who doesn't have OCD and lives a normal life. Ask yourself 'How will David act in this situation?'. Do what David will do.

Basically the idea is to emulate a normal person until one day you become that normal person.

Ofcourse you may get anxiety that you didn't do the compulsions how your OCD wanted you to. Tell yourself this:
'I will try to live life like a normal person. And if God, Life or Fate wants to punish me for that, I will accept that punishment. I thought I deserve to live a normal life'.",1754842360.0,12,2,OCD,ocd

The tingling feeling gets worse the more I do the compulsion (because it makes me think about it more), so I end up doing it in bursts until I have to stop myself out of fear of injury. My jaw has started clicking recently (maybe as a result of pushing on it so often) which makes me think about it more, so I’ve been doing it even more often. Now the right side of my jaw feels sore/tender and I sometimes have no idea if this is a mental thing or if I’m starting to really hurt myself. Anyone else experience this?",1754890909.0,1,1,OCD,ocd

1mn0ano,Most of my obsessions are very tied to nerdy interests and this makes explaining them hard,"I know this might sound EXTREMELY STUPID but most of my OCD obsessions are tied to fiction, the plots of anime, movies, videogames etc. How so you might ask? Well it generally varies between fears but it usually branches in 3 directions.

1. Is fears surrounding fiction I write, OCs I draw etc. I have paranoid fears that what I write or draw has some secret evil hidden message that means I am a bad person. Back when I was younger I had constant fears that what my drawings or stories were ""Satanic"" now that I am a fedora tipping atheist and don't have that fear anymore it has changed to a fear that they are problematic in a political sense, usually that they are ""nazi coded"" or secretly nazi propaganda, and this reaches absurd degrees, for instance once I got paranoid that the way I drew a sword's hilt accidentally looked similar to the hilt of the ""Blood and Honor"" knives that the SS had

2. Is fears where the cause and effect train of thought passes through fiction in a sense. For instance a while back I had a use fear around the Matrix and part of that fear was an obsession built around the scene in the first Matrix movie where Cypher talks to Agent Smith in a restaurant inside the Matrix and he is eating a stake and has this line about how he knows that the stake in question is an illusion created by the simulation but ""ignorance is bliss"" and he wants to enjoy it anyways and then makes the deal to betray Morpheus and ask to be put back in the Matrix without memories. And this somehow translated in my mind that if I enjoy food that is evil

3. Is fears based on what I like in fiction. That for complex esoteric reasons I shouldn't like a certain character I like because liking them makes me evil. And very often the reason behind that is a very complex series of associations between different settings.

The issue with all that is that it is very esoteric and a lot of times if I had to explain these fears I would need to also elaborate on the lore of various media. Or I guess find a very nerdy psychologist :^    )

For instance right now I have an obsession that would require me to go into several bits of both DC and Marvel lore to explain to someone.

According to my talks with my psychologist it seems that all of this stems partially from a deep seeded fear I have over what I like, my interests, being condemned or somehow objectively bad, that stems both from my mom which when I was a kid was peak paranoid ""oh will this videogame make my kid a school shooter"" ""is this toy too violent"" type a fear I had since I was a kid that I will bullied for my interests being too ""cringe""

but a lot of times I think it's way more complex or manifests in way more complex ways and it is paralyzing me whenever I wanna have fun",1754876488.0,2,1,OCD,ocd

1mmlb61,SSRI has terrible side effects,"So I've been living in the ocd prison for about ten years already. In my mid twenties now. I've tried everything - all the first and second line ssri meds, tricyclics, adjuncts like memantine or some anti-psychotics. And all the first line meds in their highest safe limit. I also developed psychosomatic pain from ocd, mostly burning on my scalp whenever intrusive thoughts hit. So I had to continue the  meds just to keep being alive even though they made me literally non functional. Antidepressants (ssri or tricyclics) always cause terrible side effects for me, shakes all over my body, blurred vision, disruption of balance, loss of fine motor skills, can't even hold a pen right when I'm on those, then the emotional blunting, lack of motivation, lack of sustained focus and on top of all these, the most insufferable of all - a constant urge to move my legs that just won't ever go away from the moment I wake up to the moment I drift off to slip. All these made me really despise the medicine route of support and find alternatives. Some alternatives seemed promising at first. They still do work to some degree. 

 I had 20 sessions of rTMS about three years ago. I do tdcs at home by myself. I supplement with NAC, taurine and some other relevant micronutrients like magnesium, vit D and occasionally b12 shots.  Lately I've gone keto and it helped with the burning scalp to some degree. But flare ups do happen and they are so unbearable that I have to take the aid of meds again, which in tern make me disfunctional at life. Mostly the constant leg jerking thing makes my life a living hell. I want to hear about you folks' experience on SSRIs. If you favour any over the other in regards to the particular side effect I'm concerned about. I'm currently on escitalopram, previously one was fluvoxamie, one before that was sertraline along with clomipramine. All these meds are a nightmare.

1mmyjp8,not caring about compulsions,"I'm wondering if there's anyone out there like me who has a threatening thought pop in when you're doing something (or planning to do something), and you just push past it? You refuse the compulsion- but not with the intention or performing erp or specifically trying to battle OCD. I'm talking, just an actual careless, ""whatever. I don't care"" type of attitude.

I am dealing with scrupulous, seeing sin in everything, type thoughts that pop in and threaten me with hell, they will say things like ""if you do this you're forfeiting Christ"" or ""if you don't stop this is a willful sin and you are going to hell over it"" and I get SO annoyed and frustrated that often times I respond back ""I don't care!"". I usually feel extremely anxious later, wondering why I reacted to those thoughts in that way, wishing I had obeyed them, knowing that while I can't control my thoughts I can control my actions and I worry my actions prove I am a horrible person who is definitely going to hell.

This has happened to me so many times, and sometimes I find myself acting bratty when these thoughts pop in and find something sinful about something I want, so then I feel the urge to give that thing up and I throw a mental tantrum trying to keep whatever it is that my mind is wanting me to throw away to keep Jesus. I hope this is making sense.

Basically I don't perform compulsions sometimes, I just flippantly reply back ""who cares"" without that actually being an intentional thing I am using to fight back, it's just that in that moment I actually do not care and that worries me. Sometimes I've even forced myself to continue whatever it was that my head threatened hell over me with, and I don't know what this says about me as a person. This isn't normal I don't think. :(

Like a damaged projector, it spins uncontrollably,

Stopping and jamming on all types of imagery.

The disturbed, the blasphemous, the disgusting,

I’ll never know what comes next from the spinning.

 

I try with all my might to stop the projector,

But every time I do, it just makes me sicker.

All the repetition makes my head hurt bad,

Before I knew the truth, I thought I was going mad.

 

But now I know the truth, even it makes me sob and mope,

But now I can go on with a shred of hope.

I’ve been thinking about you.

I wish I could have been there for you then. I wish I could have knelt beside you and said, “Sweetheart, this fear isn’t your fault. These thoughts aren’t your fault.

 You are not dangerous.

 You are not bad. You are a child with a kind heart and a mind that sometimes plays cruel tricks on you. But that doesn’t make you broken.”
You shouldn’t have had to carry that weight alone. You deserved to know that intrusive thoughts are just that; thoughts. Not omens, not proof of who you are. You didn’t make bad things happen. You didn’t have to protect everyone with rituals.
I want you to know I see how brave you were. Not because you got it “right” every time, but because you kept going, even when you were terrified. You’re not alone now. I’ve got you. I’ll carry the truth for both of us: You are loved. You are safe. And none of this was your fault.
With all the care you always deserved,
All my love,

1mmwrx7,Psych said I may need hospital for OCD symptoms?,"I have bipolar and OCD. I’ve had a fear of cars and accidents for about a decade. I cannot ride as a passenger in a car. I have to drive. 

Well, my family went to a demolition derby a few weeks ago and I thought nothing of it before I went. I couldn’t stay more than 10 minutes and had to leave. It messed me up seeing all the car ‘accidents’. 

After that, I’ve had enormous trouble driving. Anxiety to drive or knowing my family is driving. Intrusive thoughts of accidents and vivid trauma images from it. 

My main compulsion issues - picking my feet up when a car passes (they can’t be down on the floor), or picking them up when anything vertical passes (like a sign post). Worst symptom is consistently blinking and scrunching my eyes together. It happens all day and gets worse with anxiety, especially driving. My eyes are so tired by the end of the day. Obviously continuously closing your eyes while driving coupled with feet moving issues makes for not safe driving. 

He told me to not drive. Which is a problem because I also can’t ride as a passenger. He said if this wasn’t better in a few weeks he’d recommend hospitalization because I’d be non-functional. He started me on an anti-OCD med.

1mn1e11,my phone knows my ocd and targets me with it,"My phone knows. 

I had an exceptionally bad night where I kept getting intrusive thoughts about being unable to not focus on my attraction ocd, this time with transgender girls as the focus as I was in a group with some. I have an obsession about not being able to stop ruminating on attraction, then I get anxious and doing compulsions in the attempt to “act normal”. I didn’t want to be feeling attraction to people in this scenario, and im in a relationship, so the anxiety gets bad. especially as my fear makes me act more closed-off and that comes off as transphobia.

so I implement my tactics, I stop applying meaning to any feeling I get, and look through a neutral lense (I use height) and just don’t think about it. let myself forget about the anxiety. went from 9/10 anxiety to probably 3/10. okay.

next morning, I immediately start getting meet trans women and sexual ads regarding trans women on my tiktok CONSTANTLY. like, the only ad I get. some literally basically porn.

thinking back - during bad POCD spouts, I remember getting constant temu ads of a child on twitter. when I was having sexual OCD, I would get porn ads. or baby ads. etc.

obviously this is extremely distressing. I realized the reason is because I panic scroll quickly away quickly when I see a triggering ad.  sometimes turn off my phone in anxiety to recoup. That my friends, is an engagement. 

The algorithm realizes you give attention to ads when you panic scroll away. by giving it the attention and scrolling fast, tiktok and the entire internet of advertising knows to give you those ads. instead of just letting it play for a second and realizing it isn’t worth watching (in which most cases you wouldn’t even have a conscious thought at all and just scrolled) you gave it attention and got anxious and did an action. that it’s in your mind, that you’ll remember. If you did the former, you would’ve never seen or remembered the ad again. and the algorithm wouldn’t give you it again and would try advertising other things to get your attention.

That is what our brains do. you cannot turn off thoughts, and thoughts will constantly pop up trying to pull your attention. once you engage, give the thought meaning to your identity, and panic swipe the thought away, you reinforce that the thought is dangerous and the suppression ritual is necessary. the thought has won and will now come back as long as you engage with it. if you had just didn’t give it meaning, just let the thought play and without even a conscious thought just continued on, your brain will forget and try other things to get your attention. eventually you’ll master the peace - an ad will rarely, or barely, ever affect you. so stay strong. don’t give in and don’t suppress ads!!!",1754879664.0,1,1,OCD,ocd

1mmi82o,I just realized being a mother is making it worse.,"TW: child abuse of all nature; suicide

(Gonna add this random line of text to hopefully block from the preview) 

My parents both abused me (32F). Mom was mentally, emotionally, sometimes physically abusive. Dad was all of that plus sexually abusive. Stepdad was also everything but sexually abusive. Dad killed himself when I was 15 because he got caught molesting my sister and her best friend and he didn’t want to get murdered in prison. My mom just passed away 2 years ago. Stepdad still lives his lonely fucking life by himself with no one to check on him if he dies. 

I clearly have feelings about my folks. I don’t want to get into it. It’s being addressed. 

My boys are 14, 9, and 3, and we practice gentle parenting. I follow through on consequences that match the crime and I treat my children with respect. I teach, and I guide, and I love with my entire heart. I apologize often and I explain why I’m sorry. I let them see me fail and I let them see me win. I can say with my whole chest that I have amazing children and I am very proud of the way I’ve raised them, especially since I was 18 when I had my oldest. But I am obsessed with being the parent that doesn’t traumatize them.

My horrific parentage has now leaked into my subconscious and is now the biggest, main theme of my OCD. Every decision I make. Everything I did that was somewhat reminiscent of what my parents did to me, leads to this spiral of thinking. For example: my parents abused me with cleaning a lot. If I make my kids clean their room, I start overthinking it. “Am I being abusive? Was my tone kind? Should I offer help? I should just do it, they were just being kids playing. No, it’s my responsibility to teach them the way to clean and maintain their space. They deserve a clean space to live in and deserve to know how to live in it.” 

The themes often go from what I mentioned above, to also worrying about if I raised my voice too loudly, if my tone was unkind, whether I was concise and to the point and easy to understand, analyzing their tones and their posture to make sure they’re okay (but never asking while I’m having these feelings because I know I’m being absurd), to just constantly feeling guilty because why the fuck not? I’ve got to be failing at fucking something and I know I raised my voice today so yeah, it works out anyway. 

I can redirect myself and get through it while it’s happening, but the problem is it is constant and most guaranteed to be overlapping thoughts. So I can manage to put one away, and then as I’m putting it away I start hearing another. It’s like my hydra of OCD thoughts. 

I am exhausted. My kids can tell I’m exhausted. I’m a stay at home mom, this summer has really made it worse because I can’t handle the heat and I’ve got a health issue that makes it tough to go out in general (add that to the guilt pile) so I know they’re bored of the same activities over and over again. My eldest helps out a ton when he’s here (one week on/one week off custody with his Dad) and he doesn’t even know it. I do not ever ask him to watch the littles unless it’s a quick, “hey I have to pee” or “I need a brain break because I’m getting overstimulated” and just that alone has been so sweet and helpful. 

I could go on and on, and I’m sorry that I have. 

The TLDR of it all: My OCD diagnosis is relatively new and I’ve been figuring out who I am and what is the OCD, and my husband and I just put it together that parenting is my trigger. I am not on medication and I am not in therapy as of 6ish months ago. I don’t have insurance so these are not possible at the moment (but I am working on it) but I am incredibly self-aware and I keep a journal of my experiences to show to my doctor for when I go back. 

I need coping mechanisms, groups to join, the healthiest and safest ways to deal with my thoughts that don’t give in to them that also doesn’t distress me to the point of taking it out on my kids or my husband (who is an amazing support system I swear, he just doesn’t fully understand).

My younger brother (24M) is dealing with OCD and he calls me (28M) to help him work through his anxiety spikes (we live in different states btw).

1mmz6ex,OCD and Psychosis,"I've recently been struggling with a near-debilitating bout of existential ocd paired with psychotic delusions, and I don't know what to do about it so I'm wondering if there's anybody out there who's experienced anything even remotely similar. 

Essentially, every day for the past 2-ish months, I've been absorbed in thought-spirals about death, the futility of existence and the lack of meaning behind it all. It gets to the point where the panic around the fact that I will one day die fully absorbs me and I cannot move/communicate/do anything to bring myself out of it other than try to fall asleep by drinking or hitting the vape until I pass out (I'm making an effort to stop this coping mechanism since I know it's not helping the part I'm about to touch on, especially since I'm a minor, but we ball). Generally, these thought spirals escalate into full-blown beliefs that make zero sense, but which I somehow believe with full certainty in the moment (ex. humans are evolving to a final form that will destroy the universe, and I am the only one with the power/knowledge to stop it). Generally, I fully believe these ideas until someone says something that makes me question it, or until the thought spiral progresses and brings up something that contradicts itself, causing me to turn to the Wikipedia wormhole which leaves me with the knowledge that my belief is batshit crazy, but still with it lingering at the edge of my mind until a new one takes over. Sometimes, these thoughts sound like inner-monlogue voices that are yelling at each other, and when these vocal projections take hold my vision gets distorted as well (sort of like I'm looking at the world through stop-motion animation or a flip book). At the same time, I've been experiencing some other psychotic symptoms unrelated to this. Ever since I was little I've felt like some higher entity is watching me/reading my mind, but now it's gotten worse because the entity used to feel benign like some sort of God (though I was raised athiest), but now it feels malevolent. The problem is that since I've pictured my thoughts as not wholly my own as long as I've lived, I don't even know what life would even be like without believing there's something watching me, because even though the entity feels cruel I panic at the idea that I am alone in my existence. 

I don't know if the OCD is a trigger for the psychotic symptoms or if the two are just occurring concurrently, but I feel like I'm trapped in my head and that there is no reprieve from any of this apart from genuinely offing myself, but I'm too scared of where you go after you die to do it. To give some more background, I've struggled with other forms of OCD since I was in 3rd grade, and I had an extreme psychotic episode triggered by cannabis about 4 months ago where I lost responsiveness, experienced ego death, felt like I was being ripped open in every possible direction, and genuinely thought I was dead and had been sent to hell (though like I said I was raised an athiest). The residual effects of this completely went away a few weeks later and I haven't touched weed since, but I still feel like that episode as well as an intensive biology course I took over the summer have contributed to the thought spirals about death and the meaning of life. 

I appreciate anyone who's read this far, I know this post is a bit rambly but I'm 16 and have a history of mental illness in my family, so I'm scared to death that as I get older this is going to develop into an all-consuming schizophrenia that sends me back to the torturous place I went to during my major psychotic episode. I know I touched on a lot but if there's anyone who has experienced any of these things, whether it be existential ocd or ocd paired with psychosis, I would just like to know if it's possible for any of this to get better, and what you have done to manage it. 

I am going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist in a few days who will start me on antipsychotics, but it's so isolating going through this without knowing a single person who can relate, so if you semi know what I'm talking about, I would appreciate it if you could help out a friend.",1754873316.0,1,1,OCD,ocd
1mmu02v,Looking for good experience examples about medication,"TL;DR: My fiance is having OCD symptoms and I suggested asking for Luvox, but he's scared of any possible side effects, especially sexual ones. Looking for good testimonies about Luvox/any other meds that have helped you guys with your OCD to hopefully help him out.


So my (28F) Fiance (30M) has started to show symptoms of what I believe to be OCD. I myself have been diagnosed with OCD, and his symptoms he describes are almost identical to what I experience, specifically extreme and obsessive intrusive thoughts. Obviously I'm not gonna diagnose him, but he does have a psychiatrist that has been treating him for GAD. He has an appointment coming up with her soon, so hopefully she'll have some answers.

A couple of months ago, I started taking Luvox. My OCD went from crippling me every day, to almost non-existent within a week. I've never been mentally healthier in my entire life. I will sing Luvox's praises until the end of time. So of course I told him to ask his psychiatrist if he could try it out as well, as he's seen firsthand how drastically my life has improved in such a short amount of time.

Unfortunately, his old (god awful) doctor gave him Cymbalta for his anxiety a few years ago without telling him about how many side effects that medication has. It did help his anxiety, but the physical/sexual side affects really messed him up. Particularly the fact that not only did his libido drop to basically nothing, but it made it incredibly difficult for him to orgasm. When he went back to the doctor, the doctor prescribed him Wellbutrin to help the sexual dysfunction. That did help quite a bit, but he was still performing much less than he did before taking the Cymbalta. He was on it for about a year, and has now been off of it for about a year and a half. He's still taking the Wellbutrin for anxiety, but the sexual dysfunction has stayed basically the same since.

This has genuinely been traumatizing for him. He's worried his libido will never fully recover. I told him that I've seen people on Reddit say it took them two or so years to fully recover from Cymbalta, but he still seems doubtful.

So when I suggested Luvox, he basically had an anxiety attack. He's terrified that he won't be able to do anything sexual at all if he takes it because it's an SSRI. For me personally, the first couple of weeks I was on Luvox, I did have a marginal decrease in libido and it was definitely difficult for me to orgasm sometimes. But then for a few weeks after that, it flipped, and I was horny basically all the time and I could orgasm easier again. Now it's leveled out, and while my libido is a bit lower than it was before, it's definitely not non-existent. I can also orgasm relatively normally again.

I tried to tell him that and the sexual side effects are so low for me that there's no question it's worth it. Obviously, everyone reacts to medication differently. It's definitely possible it could kill his sexual performance. But he's also already on Wellbutrin, which is supposed to help with that. Also, Luvox is probably the SSRI with the least amount of side effects. I didn't even gain any weight at all. But he's still seriously doubtful about it.

It breaks my heart, because the amount of suffering he's having from his intrusive thoughts is making every day so difficult for him to get through. So what I'm really looking for is some testimonies about Luvox not having that much sexual side effects. That, or any other med that has helped your OCD with minimal side effects. Could you guys comment your experiences so I can show him how much it would help him? Also any advice at all on how to handle this would be helpful. 

Ultimately it's absolutely his choice whether or not he wants to go on meds. I'm just hoping this might help him a little bit.",1754859643.0,2,2,OCD,ocd

I’ve been battling ocd since I can remember, and I’ve tried exposure many times. Each time I feel like I’m getting better, my ocd just finds ways to go against it. I won’t say how my compulsions exactly changed (I wouldn’t want it happening to any of you), but I basically have no way of going against my ocd anymore, because ignoring my compulsions became a compulsion too.

1mmxyuo,Just right ocd and my academics,"I got diagnosed with OCD about two weeks ago. It wasn't necessarily out of the blue, seeing as my friends have been pushing me to get a diagnosis for a few years now. 

I'm trying to find a therapist who specializes with OCD, but until then I would appreciate some advice.

I'm 20 years old and I'm attempting college for the 4th time now. Before my most recent semester (Which I failed due to my just-right OCD, or at least that's what I think this is), I was unmedicated for my Bipolar and ADHD. Now that I'm medicated, I decided to give school another chance because it's what I truly want (I think). Unfortunately, I think my just-right OCD got in the way. Unless it's not just right OCD, and I'm confusing it with something else. I missed some time due to some medical complications, and after that, it wasn't the same. I instantly felt like a failure, but I wanted to catch up. My biggest issue is that I struggle with only completing the ""important"" assignments. I feel like I have to read and complete anything that's listed on the assignment page. A lot of it is just extra resources and extremely repetitive, but I feel like I haven't actually studied unless I complete every. single. one. Not only that, but I also have to complete it in the exact order that it's listed in which gets in the way of starting/finishing the more crucial parts of the lessons. 

I always feel like there is no point in starting something unless everything is ""perfect"" or in order first. I can't start homework unless all of my other, even less important, tasks are completed. 

I really don't want to fuck up school anymore. I have all of these rules that I need to follow, but I struggle to keep up with them. Once I fall behind in anything, I feel like my life is completely falling apart. Even one small slip-up or mistake makes me feel like a fraud. To me, any mistake is evidence that I don't actually value or care about anything I'm doing. But I want to believe that I care about my life and what I do with it.

Idk. Any advice on how to push through school? More mistakes are inevitable, and logically I know that, but I still structure my life in such a strict way that it doesn't account for mistakes. I don't know how to get right back up after something doesn't go according to plan. 

Sorry, this was a bit of a tangent, but does anyone have any advice on how to set up a system? I really appreciate any sort of insight. Thank you",1754869909.0,1,0,OCD,ocd

I currently work full time miraculously despite how hard dealing with OCD at work can be. I've had OCD for as long as I can remember as well as ASD (I am 23M btw). I have always been told by my support system to ""challenge the thought and compulsions"" or the whole health talk like eat well, exercise stay in therapy, get enough sleep exc. The problem is that whenever I try to better myself and get myself out of my comfort zone to try and go to the gym consistently or to cook a good meal, I am either A. so lost in my thinking patterns and obsessions or B. so exhausted from the OCD to the point where doing the simplest things can be crippling.

I am also trying my best to contribute more around the house with chores which can be a major struggle for me because of my OCD.

1mmms4g,Is there anyone who found a sexuality that resonates with them but is scared to use if bc of intrusive thoughts?,"


Bc i do. 


I have found a sexuality that resonated with me since then but couldn’t get the change to label myself as one for years bc of the fact that it made me develop intrusive thoughts that keeps telling  me how i am faking it and how i am unconsciously repressing myself sexually by hiding it with labels.

Like dang…That was crazy.


Heck it even gaved me groinal responce the more it got worse and idk how i ended up having it.


Heck i even get ppl who decided to trigger me in the comments by saying that my mind was right and needed to Touch grass ( even though i have went to the beach for TWO DAYS STRAIGHT and going to the Park the whole Time. And even outside my brain wants to mess with me )

These ppl triggered me so badly i was scared if i disagreed with them it means i am denying. Or scared if they are right and that i my mind was right. Like….dang.



One compulsion is using the stupid sexuality test which is the worst compulsion bc these test gives you fake answers everytime but i can’t stop.

There is even another one but i don’t think i wanna talk abt it since the last Time i did ppl in my comments decided to trigger me that i am repressing my desires my not liking what i saw and forcing myself into labels bc i go to a specific sub ( ik it makes no sense Ik, i am sorry)

And this triggered me so badly i kept spamming abt it.


But then i got even more scared bc i was like ‘’ what if these ppl are right abt you and that you are only denying the fact that you are forcing yourself into labels ‘’ 

And then it made me feel pale the whole Time and i felted like crying at the same Time i am literally so sick of  this crap


Like i cant trust myself with labels bc i am scared of using it as a way to sexually repress myself. Ik sexuality is fluid but i just dont want to use a label ( that resonated me for 4 or 5 years ) just or fake it or to repress real sexual attraction…


Idk why my brain did this to me. Instead of pimples and normal teen moodswings i get this..i get a brain with a good talent of manipulation


Especially since some of this  community has gatekeepers and tells you what you should be.

And a whole man from the same community called me an incel who hated everyone bc i said i didnt find ppl sexually interesing….WHY MAN…WHY.

And heck he even said that my OCD is my ALLO PARTS and why i am denying it….WTF.

I dont want to unconsciously repress sexual attraction bc i know its normal to feel it so WHATS THE POINT. HOW AM I SUPPOSED OT REPRESS. But OH NO, i Heard repressing things are mostly UNCONSCIOUS.


So if i was repressing, i wouldnt know that i am and IT TERRIFIES ME

And i dont wanna be an incel even though i am not banging ppl ON PURPOSE.


Like bro. My brain makes it complicated for me to accept a label bc it gives me scenarios in my head that i am ‘’ forcing myself to not feel sexual attraction ‘’ WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH ME.

And even ppl who makes it even more complicated by telling myself to me that my thoughts were right…I HATE STRANGERS SO MUCH TO THE POINT THAT I WISH TO BE AN ALIEN.

1mmk5fn,"I had delusions growing up, scared it means schizophrenia","Hey everyone, I wanted to share some things I’ve been dealing with and see if anyone else can relate or offer advice.

Growing up, I had some really intense experiences with delusions and unusual thoughts. When I was 14, I made up this whole story in my head about meeting a guy obsessed with me one time when I was bored, like a daydream then when I met a real guy who looked like the one I imagined (with the same name), I actually believed the story was coming true. It felt totally real to me for years until reality disproved it.

At 17, a friend told me she thought the guy I was dating was possessed by a demon. I thought she was crazy at first, but then I started looking for signs and became convinced. At one point, he even changed his Snapchat name to “Morningstar,” and I told him, “OMG I knew you were a devil worshipper,” and blocked him. He later said it was because he was trying to get back at his Christian mom or something like that. Looking back, it was totally batshit crazy, but part of me still wonders sometimes.

More recently, I sometimes can’t remember if things actually happened or were dreams, and I get derealization a lot,especially when I’m scared I might be developing schizophrenia. 

Yesterday, I panicked because I wasn’t sure if I hallucinated my dog. I locked her in the kitchen and my mom told me she was locked in there, but I remember seeing her while I was eating, then I thought maybe it’s because I saw her while I was eating sour patch kids but then I couldn’t remember if she was still locked up when I was eating those or not so I could’ve hallucinated my dog possibly. I’m also worried because the night before I had medications (including Benadryl via IV) for headaches, and I wonder if that caused confusion or delirium.

I’ve talked to my doctor and therapist about fearing schizophrenia but mostly get listened to without much follow-up or help, which is frustrating.

1mmapzk,"I deal with contamination OCD, and these are my biggest struggles","I just wanted to talk about my situation as someone dealing with contamination OCD, please feel free to share any opinions or input you'd like.

I struggle with it, but I suppose it could be a lot worse, considering that I have been able to deal with some of the things a lot better as of recently. I'm a very routine oriented person, and I like to keep consistency within that routine. Of course, not everything can be perfect, and I am alright with that, but there are things that I cannot compromise on. Once I take a shower towards the end of my day, that means I am done with everything besides relaxing at home. I cannot go outside, or drive anywhere, even if I never left the car.

I keep constant and conscious track of everything that I need to touch, what is clean and what is not. I also tend to avoid touching some things altogether because I can't bother to clean them, otherwise it may cause me further distress rather than satisfaction from knowing something is clean. These are things like commonly touched surfaces (light switches, door knobs, and handles) around my home. I live with other family members, and nobody is allowed in my personal space. I'm not a dirty or disorganized person by my standards, which are quite high, but I avoid touching these surfaces after I have showered. I have no problem touching them during the day, because I know that nothing will come in contact with my personal space, which is my bedroom, due to the fact that I only spend time in there if I know that I am clean.

I've been able to talk myself down from a handful of my biggest worries, which are usually racing thoughts and constant mental retracing of my actions. But, a portion of the issues still remain, which some of them are what I have mentioned. If I have showered, using the bathroom can be somewhat of a mental challenge due to the nature of the action, especially #2. I'm still a bit worried about that, but I usually manage to ease major worries by doing my best to rationalize it to myself, as long as I'm not being careless, there's less need to panic.

It feels stupid to explain, and doesn't make total sense now that I typed it out, but these are my struggles that I deal with every single day.",1754804872.0,4,5,OCD,ocd

Lately, i’ve been on 25mg of zoloft and in OCD therapy. i’ve had this spiral since jan. I had obsessions whether anything was physically real or not, or truly there. It started from DPDR, and then tunneled into existential questions. i’ve had this before twice already. I am a christian and was groomed by a pastor and It completely destroyed me and my faith, where it led to these things. I got out of it after a year, enjoyed life and such. It comes back every now and then and this is the most severe it’s been. I went from questioning my sight, my hearing, my touch, every sense if it was real or not or really there. Then if memories were real, if people were real, then concepts, memory itself, then solipsism. if I was the only one to exist. it was brutal and I legit would not even know for sure if anything I knew existed or if it was even there. and now i’m doubting language and the words I use. It’s like this blank feeling I get, like a lack of comprehension or I guess it’s this doubt? even when I type or read, it’s like I don’t connect to the words or understand it kinda? Idk, but I feel like i’m going insane lol. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I was actually getting better!! Doing exposures and learning to be alone, etc. I got to a point where I was like I don’t know and I don’t need to prove reality for it to be real. but I went downhill after the language thing and now it’s like utter confusion and doubt constantly, every thought I think is feeling distressed. I can look at something and doubt the words I use to describe it. my mind tells me it isn’t really what it is, or it feels foreign. even now as i’m typing i’m like confused on it. is this a result of doubting reality for so long? My psych wants to switch me to Luvox, so hopefully that helps but i’m afraid of med changes. ERP really did help, but i’m wondering if this is deeper than OCD and it’s like just getting worse?

1mmgyuz,Seeking advice from this community,"Hello everyone, I created this throwaway account because I wanted to ask this community a question regarding my partner's ocd. 

(I apologize in advance for the long text or if saying anything inconsiderate about people with ocd)

We have been together for some time, but I consider us as a new couple. They have told me that they have Obsessive-compulsive disorder/depression but that they receive medication about it and seeing a therapist. So far so good, right?

Well, their behaviour can sometimes be peculiar. They have trouble managing their money. Impulse buying and spending money on things they do not need. We've talked about it, promising they would fix it but to no avail.  
  
They also have trouble with time management, being late to our dates is also an issue (more than 15 minutes each time). When asked about it, they either say they were in bed or watching YouTube. We have talked about this but it is a 50-50 thing, sometimes they arrive in time, sometimes they are 25 minutes late. 

Similar to this, they change our plans the last moment with no further notice. Did we agree to go to the theatre? they want to go to the movies or pay a visit to their friends (a couple of hours before the play starts). When I ask them why they didn't tell me from the start they didn't want to go to the theatre/cinema/restaurant, they asnwer ""impulsiveness"".

Changing an opinion about something in a heartbeat is something I also noticed. One day they might say A, and the next day they swore they said B. We have talked about it, and they promised to be more stable with their opinions to no avail.

Their expression of sexuality is confusing as well. One day they initiate sex like every other person, the next day they want to wait until marriage and (erotically) push me away (even though I have expressed my needs for deeper connection). 

If we fight, they disappear without sending a text or making a phone-call (I always send texts to check up on them).
Then, days later, they reappear as if nothing happened. Even during our fights they seem to disassociate and ""disconnect"" so to speak. 

They excuse the lack of texts by saying they are bad texters, but even during face-to-face convos I feel like I am the only one who initiates most of the talking (asking stuff about themselves, not focusing on myself).

Whenever they do not get their medication, I simply ask them why they do that. They either say they forgot about it or ""self-sabotage"".

Now I received a text saying they will be out of town to some relatives, even though they had told me they wouldn't go so we could spend more time together. I already haven't seem them for some days because of work and life problems. 

I am aware that ocd is a very serious condition which can affect a person's mind and soul. I am trying to be considerate (as a diagnosed neurodivergent myself). I ask them about it. Things I should be careful about, things I can help them out with, how to manage my behavior as to not trigger their ocd etc etc.

My question (finally) is: how much of their behavior is due to Ocd and how much due to their personality?

1mmbjz2,My ocd is deteriorated,"I've been feeling the symptoms since I was a child, I remember that around 12 they got a little bigger and now, at almost 17, I feel like I'm going crazy.

I can't talk about it completely with anyone, whether it's a psychiatrist, a nutritionist or a psychologist, one of the most negative effects I have is that everything I say/write seems like a lie (even now).

even if for example this morning I ran into a friend of mine at the supermarket, it's true, it's real, I know, I saw her, she saw me, we said hello and even stopped to chat.
the moment I maybe tell it to my mother 'today I saw Mary at the supermarket!' I feel the agitation of the lie: the increased heartbeat, the more shaky voice and...
I'm convinced I'm making it up, even if maybe Mary sends me a message saying ""it was nice chatting with you today, let's go out sometime""

obviously, the intensity of the effect varies depending on the topic covered and the perception to which I say it.

if I talk about the meeting with Mary (of little emotional importance for me) or about my OCD (of high importance, it hurts me, it causes me suffering), in the second case the symptoms increase.

ditto for whoever I talk about it with.

if I talk about Mary to you strangers (low emotional impact on both sides), the effect will be mild, so mild that you will barely feel it and it will seem almost normal, although not entirely. 

if I talk about Mary to my mother (contrast low emotional impact - high emotional impact) I will feel the symptoms slightly more which will lead me not to tell it, or to tell it but hastily.


if I talk about OCD to you strangers (high emotional impact-low emotional impact) I already have a little more difficulty, because I feel like I'm making fun of you who are 'really ill' while I'm an impostor, it also helps me that, in fact, I don't know you, and everything remains anonymous.

if I talk about OCD to my psychiatry (high emotional impact-high emotional impact) it becomes IMPOSSIBLE.
I start to whimper, often cry, tremble, look around, repeat in my head ""so it seems like you're telling lies, you have to look at her eyes, you have to have your torso straight, you don't have to tremble, don't stutter, you're not realistic"" IT'S HELL.

I don't know how, I don't know with what internal, mental and physical strength I managed to do it, but I managed to tell my psychologist and nutritionist ONE symptom, which would be vomiting (in a self-induced manner) twice.

for this reason they understood that something was wrong, the vomiting seemed disconnected to them from my eating disorder (because in fact it is now like that) and they would like me to speak to psychiatry in advance since my appointment with her would be a week.

but I don't want to.

I can't.

and then, among ALL the thousands of symptoms I have, what sense does it make to just talk about the vomiting?

In some situations after something like that happens, I try not to be rude and just keep going on with life, but it just keeps stuck and the obsessions lasts for months and months, and some last for years, until I call that person and curse them, only then the obsessions disappear.

Other examples are when relatives enter my room, or when I'm being touched in public, or when a relative make a high noise close to my room, or when a worker in my house make a rude comment and I feel slighted... things like that, and they cause me tremendous anxiety, hair loss, high blood pressure, until I actually lash out at them, only then the obsessions disappear and I feel relaxed.

When an obsession happen that is caused by someone doing something to me, I just become focused on that obsession, I don't sleep well, I don't eat well or enjoy anything, all anxiety symptoms worsen and my heart beat fast and I become aware of it, I cannot concentrate on any other activity, and when I try force myself to concentrate, I suffer tremendously. I just focus on that obsession all day, I also lose lots of hair, the more I wait and endure, the more hair I lose in a very short period of time, until I reach despair, and I just enter extreme survival mode, and the only thing I think about is to fight, so the only road is to get back to that person who did this to me and I either curse them or lash out at them.

Now, I'm just self Isolating in my own room, afraid even to go outside my room to avoid any noise or accidental touch by some relative, I haven't been outside home for over 3 years. The only reason I'm isolating is to avoid all that cycle of despair I described. Also, my blood pressure is now 139/90 and I'm only 34 years old. When an obsession episode happens, it goes up to 145/90. I'm also a male.",1754818802.0,1,0,OCD,ocd

1mm5mfd,Extreme distress about bugs and water damage,"Looking for help coping with contamination OCD, bugs, and water damage. Bugs in my home are my number one trigger, and I am living in a historic (75 year old) house for the first time with a shitty landlord who does not carry out repairs in a timely manner. 

We had a really big leak from a broken toilet in the house recently (inches of standing water both upstairs and downstairs) and maintenance didn't get here for a whole day. Cleaning up the water by myself and dealing with all the accompanying thoughts and worries was incredibly taxing. They cut holes in ceiling downstairs and put in a giant dehumidifier, which for a couple days, made the house (and my brain) feel SO much better. But the dehumidifiers generate so much heat that I think we're honestly worse off now. I have also begun finding smokey brown cockroach nymphs in the house, including two today. Cockroaches are my number one most feared bug. 

I am really scared to find bugs in my home because that tells me that my home is unsafe and I cannot relax there. I check every room many times in a specific manner to see if there are bugs. I am bound to find something with how excessively I am checking. I do not want to see a bug in my house at all, but in a kind of twisted, subconcious way, I \*do\* want to see a bug, because it would confirm my fears and anxieties and validate my obsessions and compulsions. 

I am just so tired, and I feel hopeless. I do not know how to relax. No amount of weed or drinking or sleep can quell the way I feel. I can't afford ERP or anything specific but I am on a few waitlists. I wish I could be someone that understands roaches and bugs are an inevitable part of life, and I wish they did not cause such a visceral reaction for me. It does not help that my roommates are not home often and do not see these things as a very big deal. They are very go with the flow, whatever happens happens kind of people, and it frustrates me.

Thank you for reading this. ",1754788533.0,3,2,OCD,ocd
1mm9qon,Shared office workspace triggering - contamination,"My workplace has moved to a shared office workspace model, which means we no longer have our own desks, chairs, keyboards, or mice. Having to share and touch these surfaces triggers my contamination OCD every single day. While I can disinfect everything, someone else uses the space again the next day. Even disinfecting is exhausting, because it requires thorough handwashing before and after, which makes it almost impossible to keep up with. I come home feeling dirty simply because of my workspace and spreading it all over. It’s all so exhausting.

Is anyone else dealing with this? Any advice?

1mmd3nw,Head banging because of anger issues and OCD.,"I'm 17, male. My OCD has started since December last year. Every day has been constant rituals, anything I do leads to a ritual, especially moving because my fear is avoiding to bump into things, and this is embarrassing to say, but it is because I want to avoid bumping into something on my behind. Narrow spaces make it worse, and my underwear makes it worse as well. Sometimes I spend an hour or even more trying to complete rituals. My family knows about this, but they are planning to get me a therapist to 'help', I have done research, and most therapists 'treat' OCD by recommending ERP. Something that I avoid because it only makes things worse. I have tried it as much as I could, but there is nothing I can do. So I extremely dislike it, and it seems like there is nothing else that can treat my OCD that isn't similar to ERP. When the rituals get very frustrating, I end up banging my own forehead with my fist. The anger issues do not contribute to this. They make it worse. Before this I was able to do a lot of things in my life without having to worry about bumping into something. If I get brain damage, it is very likely that I might kill myself, which is something I don't want to do, or I am going to run away from my own home, as I am running out of options.",1754813920.0,1,1,OCD,ocd

I went from being a hermit indoors to having a job, finishing up college etc. But I can’t take short showers after a bowel movement. I was always raised to shower your bottom after you go #2, and my contamination ocd makes me fear potentially not being clean in my bottom as if it’s the plague. If I go #2 I spend almost 1 hour & 20 mins mostly spent cleaning my bottom. I’ve experienced dry skin & bleeding, it’s literally painful and embarrassing to tell anyone. And despite this pain, I can’t stop. I know it’s not sustainable but I can’t stop. If I don’t go #2 I can take a 20-30 min shower like a normal person. But the fear of my bottom being dirty makes me spiral and think I’m going to get sick from it. I absolutely hate myself for being like this, I literally am just hurting myself & hurting my skin. This isn’t normal at all- other people can wipe with toilet paper and go on with their day. But the mere thought of doing that would drive my ocd nuts. It’s amazing to me this is the biggest issue my ocd has created for me now despite all that I’ve gotten through. ocd is a curse, it makes the simplest things incredibly difficult. it ruins your life in the strangest ways.

i know we’re all immoral in our own ways, but i can’t help and sit here and think how different i must be from everyone else.

i look around at society, everyone walking through the streets happily chatting, do they ever have thoughts that theyre irredeemable? thoughts of loved ones never speaking to them again if they knew? 

i’ve always been a very kind and compassionate person. i’ve always had a high sense of morality. i really thought i was one of the most morally perfect people in the world up until now.

i want to stay in this world and help people, make the world a better place. change lives POSITIVELY. so would my own desire for punishment, confessing my mistakes and ruining my reputation forever- not just prevent me from doing so?

would the universe not benefit more if i moved on? or do i truly not deserve to?

1mm58vb,constant anxiety at night over mom getting cancer/dementia,"I should clarify that I do *not* have a formal diagnosis of ocd nor has my psychiatrist mentioned me being at risk. I do, however, struggle with constant worrying (anxiety-adjacent? i don't know) and this also includes fixating on said worries even if I don't want to.

I'm 20 turning 21, and for the last 3 or so years I've been becoming more uncomfortably aware of my parents aging, even more so now since my mom just turned 51 about a month ago (this is mainly about my mom since i'm very attavhed to her, I have both a stepdad and my biogical dad but I didn't really get to get close with them, at least not for now)
I have a habit of having ruminating thoughts, one of the main topics that I struggle with is health conditions and disease (used to be very paranoid about having cancer back in highschool and obsessed over even slightly ""off"" symptoms I've had), this went away for a while and I would only sometimes get ocassionsl bothersome thoughts

I should also note that I've had lived through a lot of far relatives (but still relatives) dying, mainly from cancer. My grandma was diagnosed with alzheimers when I was a toddler, she was relatively fine for some time, but her condition had gotten down a slope at the time I was a teenagercand she had to be put under care since she was struggling with taking care of herself.
For about the next 2-3 years, me and my mom would visit her, my mom asked me to and I would also help her with some things when I was there.
My grandma's health would detoriate really quickly, she wouldn't remember my name or my mom's and only recognized us by appearance, until she didn't, she became incapable of forming sentences, then words, to the point she couldn't even make a simple noise of agreement or disagreement
Alzheimers turned her into a husk, it got so bad that I would wait with my stepdad outside because she was worried about how I'd react seeing her in such an awful state, she would come back to the car crying in the last few visits, some time later my mom would get a phone call from the care center informing her that grandma died

It was soul-crushing for my mom, and horrifying for me, especially now when I look back at it

i tend to fall asleep later than my parents do, so I often wnd up alone with my thoughts, and it doesn't always end well

I had a realization that a person is inherently at a higher risk of alzheimers if other members in the family have it

my grandma that has passed away was my mom's mother

cancer is also extremely common, and while not always a death sentence, it usually still is, increasingly more so the older you get
you are also more likely at risk of developing alzheimers and similar dementia-related conditions

it doesn't help that my mom smokes, maybe not entire packs a day, but ot is something she's done for a long time now

i'm afraid of the possibility of having to witness my own parent's mortality, my *mom's* inevitable death, and i'm so scared it's gonna be from the hands of a horrible disease, I don't want to see her wither away and not be able to do anything about it, just thinking about this sends me into a crying fit, I know everyone dies eventually, but I can't cope, even more so if it's going to be a long time of suffering for her

this fear has been persistent for months and has gotten worse since my mom's birthday, it's affected me to the point i've lost sleep. It's currently almost 3 in the morning and I'm not asleep because my brain convinced me that she will get the beginnings cancer/dementis if I let my guard down

I don't know what to do, I feel like I can't cope because I would just be deluding myself, I'm an adult and I still can't comprehend the loss of my parents, and that it could be painful and horrible. I don't know if any advice can be given in this case but at least I hope someone might be able to comfort me, thanks",1754787395.0,2,0,OCD,ocd

About 2 weeks ago, my most disturbing intrusive thought came up and I've had no way to shake it off. I've seen a psychologist, she said she's certain its OCD. I've told my close family about my disturbing thoughts and they are very supportive.

The thing is, this might be considered reassurance. Talking and letting it out is good and it felt like such a relief opening up without holding everything in my head. But my family want to reassure me with comments like ""We know you would never do something like this"", ""We would still love you"". While this is nice to hear, it feels like reassurance and I need to be able to handle my thoughts without reassurance, which I've never had to learn before. But without this reassurance I would feel miserable, I would still be alone thinking my family would hate me because of my thoughts.

So when is ""reassurance"" good and when is it not? I mean is it bad being told my family believes in me and will support me? Maybe if I keep asking them to reassure me its a bad thing, since then its a compulsion. I feel bad > talk to family > I feel better short-term.

I often ruminate thinking about whether or not chronic stress and fear from OCD can “turn into” schizophrenia and cause delusions and hallucinations.

This fear has been particularly worse after I tried psychedelic mushrooms and had a terrible experience. No visuals or hallucinations, just fear and stress. I kept ruminating about whether or not I’m going crazy. Now after the fact, I’m trying ERP methods to help recover. I went over to r/schizophrenia and looked through the threads. Just being there I could feel my anxiety rising, my brain immediately starts trying to make the connections of “that’s me,  I belong in this subreddit” but I tried to just sit in that uncomfortable feeling and think rationally. But the more I read the more anxious I felt. I ended up searching OCD on there to see if anyone had their OCD turn into schizophrenia, and saw a lot of people saying their schizophrenia started with an OCD diagnosis. At this point I realized I was doing more harm than good and it just turned into ruminating. And now I’m here cause I feel freaked out.

I'm having to work at it faster than I want to, because I have to go to a funeral soon. This means working hard every day to make some progress towards feeling okay getting in the car again. Instead of letting the progress happen at a comfortable pace, I have to rush it.

Yeah, it's good that I think I can make it, and it'll be good to be using my car again but I'd really rather not be so anxiously rushed to get there and it would feel better if I got back in my car because I *wanted to*, because I worked up to it more comfortably, because I was *ready*, and because I was going someplace better than a damn *funeral*, I mean what a reward for all my hard work.

Even when I tried to explain, I was still shunned.

Four years later and I feel guilty despite knowing I didn't do anything wrong. I reached out to apologize, even though I did nothing horrible.

I know it's not my fault, and I've gotten so much reassurance, but False Memory and just the way this happened has made my OCD fueled.

At this point, I've gaslit my own self I don't know whats real anymore. That and rumination makes me find other things in my past to use as evidence of me as guilty.",1754789029.0,1,1,OCD,ocd
1mm5qa8,Has anyone else struggled to find a therapist/psychologist  that SPECIALIZES in OCD?,"Hey everybody. So, my intrusive thoughts have flared up again, and I am considering going back to see somebody for talk therapy/ERP. 

My main problem at the moment is that I live in a comparatively underpopulated, rural area of the US, and no one within at least, like, a 50-mile radius seems to specialize in OCD treatment. It’s frustrating as heck. 

I tried the IOCDF’s (International OCD Foundation) search tool, and that yielded nothing. Anyone with accreditation at the closest distance was about 2 hours away. Then I tried seeing if anyone on NOCD was licensed in my state and took my insurance (spoiler alert: none of them took the insurance). 

Does anyone have any other recommendations or search tools for finding somebody who has a proven track record of treating clients with OCD? Or am I just going to have to window shop for therapists and psychologists?

1mluyuv,Friend With OCD Compulsively Seeking Reassurance,"Hello there. 

I have OCD myself and I've been in treatment for about a year. ERP therapy is fantastic and has reduced my symptoms by an incredible amount. 

I'm not posting this because I'm experiencing anxiety related to the question, and I'm not interested in reassurance or getting it solved. I would just like general thoughts and opinions from more people who have been on both sides.

I have a friend with OCD whose method of seeking reassurance involves guilting members of the friend group by saying they're responsible for their anxiety, so people who are less aware of how OCD works panic and feel compelled to reassure them.

I have been very clear about setting limits on reassurance seeking, but the friend has been sending long guilt-tripping messages to different friends several times a day, and is clearly in crisis, but refuses to go to a professional. 

They repeatedly state it's our fault their OCD is as bad as it is, and that we need to drop everything and do what they say in order to fix it for them. This is inappropriate and alarming, especially for much younger members of the friend group who don't know how OCD works, who are being told they are directly responsible for this person's distress.

I'm unclear on how to approach this compassionately. I've been in crisis before and I know how it feels, and I know their actions are compulsions. This doesn't change the fact that they are frightening the people around them. I feel like I'm watching them self-destruct all their friendships, but I don't think there's anything I can do.

Is it excessive to say to them ""we can't help you the way you need to be helped, and your actions are scaring your friends. Please reach out a professional?""

1mlx9hx,21M with OCD struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"After the break-up of my 2 to 2 and a half year long relationship (he was checked out the last half a year so I don't know if it even counts) due to cheating a few months back, I've realized I don't really have much of anyone to lean on in my life. All my old friends just went their seperate ways in life and are with people they would much rather be around, I got left behind in the shuffle. And reaching out just has not been successful in that regard, either. So I've been trying to make new friends, but nothing really sticks. Either it's temporary fulfillment because they're bored and they just go back to their usual circles when they're done with you or there is a VERY CLEAR REASON why they are alone in life in the first place. I can't lean on family either, there is far too much diagnosed PTSD trauma attached to them to want to stay under their roof any longer. 

I need to work really hard this senior year to get something rolling in my art career, because right now I don't have any prospects at all. And I need a career to help get me out my abusive household. But the drive to continue is just not there. And even then, getting a career and living alone with no one doesn't even sound that appealing either, even if it gets me out of my trauma. Because I'll still be alone. I'm starting with a new therapist at the end of the month, but I honestly don't even care about myself enough to take any of their advice to heart. So I don't know why I'm even bothering. I don't really care if I have my whole life to live. I don't really care if there's a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. Every day of intrusive thoughts from OCD just kick me over and over again and the anhedonia has never been worse so I can't even distract myself in my hobbies. So I am at an utter loss. Empty condolences only do so much, I need something to change and quick. Otherwise I'm not reaching that light at the end of the tunnel.",1754765919.0,2,0,OCD,ocd
1mlx2cw,current intrusive thought fixation: incest! 🫩,"as the post title says, big tw for intrusive thoughts about incest and s/a. i want to share my intrusive thoughts here again to help myself feel less ashamed, which will hopefully lessen the power of my ocd.

i've had these types of intrusive thoughts literally all my life, but my mind likes to particularly fixate on the possibility of my dad molesting me. he is an amazing person and i know for a fact that he would NEVER hurt me, but for whatever reason it's something i've always ""obsessed"" over. whenever i sit next to him in the front seat of the car, i get flashing images of him trying to assault me and i usually physically shake my head to try and get rid of them, which i'm sure disturbs him LOL it probably feels like it's worse right now because i've been driving around alone with him pretty often. i have incestuous intrusive thoughts about my mom and sister as well, but i'm inherently very afraid of men so that definitely contributes to it being particularly about my dad most of the time. i also have that horrible fear that i'm secretly into incest and want to be with my dad 😐 

i've been medicated for ocd for a while, which has significantly helped me stop doing rituals. unfortunately, i still struggle a lot with the intrusive thoughts themselves. i don't know if they ever really go away. i was wondering if anyone has advice about this? again, i hope talking about it openly like this will help, but ocd really likes to just be as annoying as possible!",1754765422.0,2,3,OCD,ocd

I got in a relationship with my partner a little over a year ago, and I love them dearly, but I had went from no social interaction to dating them. Before them, I was experiencing mild symptoms which we all thought was psychosis due to “delusional beliefs”. After a while, my therapist figured out it was intrusive thoughts related to OCD rather than psychosis.

After I started dating my partner, I started realizing they were starting to trigger some thoughts regarding religion(which I had stayed far away from due to these thoughts) and relationship worries, all the way to intrusive thoughts about my own morality. Some others sprinkled in there for fun.
— I’m still unsure of the words for all of this, I don’t even know if I have a specific subtype or if I just experience them all honestly.

The therapist that helped me, I have had to stop seeing due to other reasons and my new therapist and psychiatrist don’t even have a clue about it, so I can’t talk to them. 

I’ve tried every coping mechanism I can think of, and I don’t know how to bring it up to my new therapist and psychiatrist because I don’t trust them yet. I’m also dealing with trying to get them to understand another mental health issue of mine (DID) because they’re not aware of it either from my past therapist.

How do you handle when someone you absolutely love with all of your heart, just sets the thoughts off? It’s like a daily thing where I am constantly experiencing at least one intrusive worry and am battling with the compulsive urges. On bad days, it’s back to back compulsion after compulsion.

1mltld7,Vyvanse allowing me to actually organize erp sessions and commit to them,"I started taking vyvanse a few days ago and it seems to have decreased my severe intrusive thoughts and compulsions which is strange. I mean I’ve had very severe ocd since I was like 13… and of course it’s also helping me commit to erp. For instance, I was nervous yet still highly motivated about purposely giving myself a sunburn yesterday as a form of erp. I followed through with it exactly as planned, and habituated myself to the anxiety surrounding it without running away or giving myself reassurance. My obsessions and compulsions are still here, just way milder and seem to have shifted more to the pure o form which is actually what I prefer (as opposed to dictating where I can physically go). Im still sort of avoidant towards stressful tasks but it’s not nearly as bad. I’m cautiously optimistic about this, it reminds me of when my ocd was under much better control as a teen before the SSRIs stopped working. Though I will say the come down is absolutely awful. I’d rather not be on this long term and hope it just allows me to practice TRUE erp for the first time in years so that I can go into remission again. Anybody else experience something like this? I’m no scientist but I feel like the way it impacts dopamine in my brain is helpful, whereas SSRIs have been inducing extrapyramidal side effects in me lately (which is a result of dopamine receptors being blocked).

1mlkkic,I'm starting to avoid people because I fear everyone is secretly a pedophile,"Background: I've been diagnosed with Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (With an emphasis on obsessive symptoms and intrusive thoughts) since I was 15, my current psychiatrist believes it is actually OCD due to issues unrelated to this post. I've always struggled with paranoia that people are secretly pedophiles or predators, it's just been more frequent recently.

I'm asking for advice on how to deal with these intrusive thoughts, around a year ago I deleted almost all social media after a breakdown following some online sexual harassment (as well as just not supporting them).  Recently (I think in part due to regained teenage memories) I've been having like weird daydreams that in the future, my partner will be arrested for possession of CP.  I'm somewhat worried that my father is a disgusting pervert. And I am terrified that I'll befriend new people and they'll turn out to be registered sex offenders.

So far, these thoughts haven't yet reached the obsessive mind spiral and avoidant behaviour I've had in the past and I've been avoiding things that will make it worse (Obsessively comparing myself to teenage photos of me in the mirror, checking the Sex Offenders list, looking up my exes online, etc etc).  But I know I can't deal with it forever, especially if I want to move on from the past and continue pursuing my relationship and building trust so I want to deal with it in a more permanent productive way.  I've been trying to find resources to help but everything that pops up is abt POCD and abt fear of being a pedophile, which it's great that POCD is becoming more acknowledged and less stigmatized but gods I've not found much to help with my specific fears, especially not when a lot of current conversation is about how anonymity on the internet might be encouraging pedophilia. It's all very interesting but unhelpful.

In the hopes of not falling back into a depressive pit with a side of paranoia, please does anyone have advice or have experience with these things?  I care for my partner very much and I do enjoy leaving the house, I don't like where these thoughts might lead.  I'm also worried that my fear of getting worse could be obsessive itself and that it all comes back to the same irrationality.  Thoroughly confused and sleep deprived.",1754728709.0,5,1,OCD,ocd

1ml0xh1,ChatGPT made my OCD worse than its ever been,"Who could have guessed, right? I think my sister got tired of me asking questions and reassurance (which is very understandable) so she told me to just download ChatGPT. I have always had reservations about AI and was pretty staunchly against it, just on environmental impact alone, and I also thought it had potential to make people forget their humanity. I really do trust my sister's judgement as she is in the medical field, I just don't think either of us could have anticipated how badly it would affect my OCD.

I was going through a really bad health anxiety spell, so I caved and just wanted to try anything while waiting for my insurance to all smooth out so I could get real therapy.

In a previous comment on this sub I mentioned that I told my ChatGPT to try ERP methods instead of reassuring me and thought this was great, and assumed it was helping and could even be the cure I was looking for. I was stupid and desperate and I am very ashamed. 

Obviously it didn't work long term but in the moment it felt so good to covertly get reassurance and then feel like I was making progress on top of that. But I started finding myself talking to ChatGPT instead of reaching out to my support system because it gave constant unconditional feedback, and I became very disillusioned and isolated. I also stopped relying on my creative outlets for processing and instead just spent all my time in loops of questions and reassurance.

My OCD got EXTREMELY bad. Like, 10 years old and unmedicated levels of bad. So many old habits came back and my compulsions felt almost impossible to resist. I became suicidal and went days without proper sleep from how time consuming my compulsions were. I felt hopeless to stop them on my own. I assumed my meds stopped working or that I was going through extinction burst or something, but when I tracked the timeline back, things only started going downhill when I started using Chat. So I deleted it and wouldn't ya know! It was AWFUL at first. I had a panic attack from not being able to check and ask, and started waking up with nauseous anxiety every morning but waited it out, and it's slowly gotten a lot better.

This isn't to say I got NOTHING out of it. I think I actually did learn a few helpful things, like ERP methods I didn't really know about and that writing down those grounding ""5 things I can see"" exercises helps more than just trying to think about the answers. I got a really helpful exercise routine that gave me the confidence to start getting into fitness. I realized that writing things down and journaling in general is probably a really useful processing method for me.

But after deleting it my OCD has eased up again and I'm more able to resist compulsions, even checking. I do feel grateful for the methods I learned and the confidence it gave me, but it got those from communities like this that I could have reached out to. I think since deleting it I've become a lot more interested in making genuine connections with people. I think I just wanted a friend? Or to feel like someone was listening and seeing me. 

Either way, I am more understanding to people who use this tool now, but I believe it is overall an unreliable and misleading ""solution."" What if instead I had just reached out to someone into fitness? Or joined a group for ERP? I would have made connections AND been environmentally friendly.

Anyways, this is long and rambly. Curious about people's thoughts and experiences with this. So far I have been able to resist redownloading and even Googling, which I guess WOULD make me in a better place than before I started using it. But how much of that is just my own reflecting?

It feels like there is someone else inside me, that is always in opposition. 
Every opinion I have is immediately barraged by counter arguments, like ""is this opinion morally correct? is it socially acceptable? what if I ever run into somenone who has an opposite opinion of said thing?"" 
Every single thought and move of mine is constantly exposed to these destructive thoughts.
I think the most hard aspect of this for me is that when i see small children somewhere, my first feeling is happiness, just pure childlike joy.
I want to smile at them, wave at them, make them laugh (for americans, i am from a country where it is normal to talk to other people's kids), and suddenly a stream of awful thoughts start pounding my mind, like ""what if the parents think i'm a freak? what if someone else is watching this and finds it weird? what if some pred catchers suddenly appear out of nowhere and start filming me? how could i possibly defend myself at the face of such an injustice?""

It is really hard for me to live like this, as these doubts have by now taken over every aspect of my being. Up until recently, they regarded mostly the material things, but now, when these thoughts attack my own soul, it's very hard to cope.

I'm not diagnosed but from what i read, it could very well be OCD. I will talk with my psychiatrist about all of this.

1mll8z1,Extreme fear of crystals,"Please do not give advice if you’re not sure if it’s helpful❤️ 

I have ROCD. All my fears and thoughts are about possibly losing the love of my life. 

Last week I remembered the existence of crystals and that I used to use crystals to attract what I wanted 6 years ago. I never really questioned if it could work back then cause there were people saying that it did so I believed that. I am quite easily influenced and gullible.

I have not been into spirituality for years, not interested in it and don’t want to use it. I just want to live my life the way I want to without using ‘external’ influences to try and attract something or change something, it kind of scares me. But because I used to be sure that it could work , I can’t say that I don’t believe in it at all. However this belief has changed into fear. Specifically the fear that having crystals around or using crystals will lead to my relationship ending, maybe I’ll suddenly lose feelings or the crystals will make me realize that my fiancé isn’t the one for me. 

I accepted that I have to live with this uncertainty but that I also don’t need to practice crystals to prove that it’s true or not true (and I also created a script for imaginal exposure). I soon wasn’t too bothered by the thoughts of crystals because there were more threatening thoughts about my relationship ending last week. 

However yesterday I realized that the crystals I bought 6 years ago (and kind of set intentions with, eg to attract a boyfriend) are still in my room at my parents house. I have lived on my own for the past 3 years and I almost never sleep at my parents but lately I have been doing it a little more often and am planning on sleeping there sometimes. 

So right now I am dealing with an extreme fear that if I sleep there, those crystals might influence me even though I don’t want them to and I don’t want to use crystals. I am just so scared that by just being there they’ll do that, especially since I bought them 6 years ago so they’re mine and I did want to use them with a specific purpose back then. 

I understand that throwing them away would be avoidance, but I also feel like my OCD will try to add a next step each time. That I’ll sleep at my parents once but that it’ll tell me that it could also happen in the future. That I have to have crystals in my own home as exposure or use crystals as exposure even though I don’t want to have or own them (also that might be a compulsion to prove that it’s true or false). I am just really scared and I don’t know if anyone has something helpful. ",1754731538.0,2,0,OCD,ocd
1mled2w,Obsessing over death,"Hello. I am 19f, was diagnosed with OCD 5 years ago after my dad passed away. Most of my life i’ve struggled with loss and death was quite common in my family. Last year, i started dating my current boyfriend. He’s an absolute gem in my life. Just poster perfect boyfriend. He’s supportive, kind, so caring. 
Lately one of my obsessive thoughts have been about him… well I can’t even type it in fear of manifestation, but i’m sure you can assume by the title. I can’t even talk to him about this either in fear that my thoughts will imprint onto him. I’ve been grieving him in my head, and my ocd has already come up with a date it’s going to happen and I can’t stop obsessing and stressing about it happening.

I’m a 21-year-old woman who’s been struggling with my sexuality for a while. I don’t feel any real attraction to women in real life it feels more like lust than actual attraction.

I was exposed to adult content early on 9 or 10 and had constant sexual thoughts, but they didn’t cause me stress at first because I thought it was normal. Later, around 16 or 18, these thoughts became more intrusive and distressing.

Lately, watching adult videos with women, men, or both triggers intrusive thoughts about my female and male relatives. This makes me feel uncomfortable. Sometimes I don’t care about the thoughts, which makes me feel gross about myself and makes it harder to deal with .

I don’t have any actual attraction to females and have never been with one. My boyfriend, who I’ve been with since 2018, says he’s okay with me watching adult content as long as I’m not dependent on it. But I still feel guilty about it and genuinely feel like I can’t stop.",1754723438.0,2,3,OCD,ocd

I would keep a track so I won't make that mistake again but my brain also telling me that I won't count cause I made that mistake when I was in ""I don't care"" mode so keeping track of it useless since I care about that mistake.

For example, one time I forgot to brush my back when I was in shower, after that my brain told me that I never wash my back before and it wasn't a one time mistake, I made that mistake before but I only realized it now. Then, I'd thinking about it all day, that I didn't clean my body properly all this time because I didn't care and I'm disgusting for it.

Another example when I was watching a movie, hall the way through I realized that I put the movie on 0.75x speed, I was surprised that I didn't realized the movie slowed (I wonder if it was because I didn't that care about the movie so I didn't realize).

1mlkd0e,Diagnosis,"Hey all.
So... i don't officially have ocd, I'm just coming on here to basically ask if it's worth it getting an ocd diagnosis? I think I may have ocd and I'm seriously considering trying to get diagnosed. I am already diagnosed with GAD (generalised anxiety disorder) and autism.
There are two main reasons really, that im thinking about trying to get diagnosed,
1 is that recently my ocd-like or anxiety symptoms have manifested into being obsessed or hyper aware of food/utensils/hands being ""dirty"". So if a family member takes crisps from a sharing bag without washing their hands it makes me really stressed and I just don't eat the crisps. I just can't. It's not even a fear of getting ill from them, it's just this kind of weird mind fuckery, where if I _know_ the food is dirty I just literally can't eat it. If I didn't know I would happily eat it and i think I would probably be fine. I just cant seem to knowingly ingest food that I think is dirty. And this NEVER used to be a problem.
It's getting kinda hard to deal with. Like I'll buy a sandwich from the shop and I'll clean my hands using anti bac wet wipes (I love them) and open the sandwich bag, but oh no. I've touched the outside of the sandwich bag which has been in the shop which is undoubtedly unclean, with people's hands touching it. So I have to clean my hands with the wet wipes again, then I can pick up the sandwich and eat.
I just never literally used to think about stuff like that at all. I just ate. I don't know why this is happening. It's tiring.

2  is that I've struggled with intrusive thoughts my whole life. I've had periods where I'd obsess over something in a similar way to the 'clean' thing now. I used to think (i say think, but I'd get graphic images flashing in my mind) that I'd get attacked or SA'd by the people passing me on the path I'd be walking on. And I was convinced, i'd tense up and everything, I would avoid walking because of it. Every time a person walked past me and didn't hurt me I'd be _genuinely_ relieved and surprised.
The other bout of those kind of intense intrusive thoughts was... well i don't really want to talk about them here. Those ones are the main reason I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of having to talk to someone about my intrusive thoughts. I have this stupid fear that I'm actually happily thinking those particular intrusive thoughts and that I'm a terrible person.. but yeahh.


This is all just a very simplified version of my experiences, but i was just wondering, is there help for these kinds of things? Would getting an ocd diagnosis (IF it is ocd) help me to get some support for these things? I have a friend with ocd who says it sounds like ocd to them, but yeah.
I don't know if this is just anxiety and autism. I mean, truthfully you guys aren't going to be able to tell me, I guess i just need to book an appointment.
I just. I just don't know if I can talk about those particular intrusive thoughts. The idea of them being on record forever with the nhs... I hate that thought. Andwhat if it is true and... idk. I'm spiralling here. But anyways.

I guess what I'm really asking is: did getting diagnosed with ocd help you to get better? Is it worth it for me to persue this? I really don't want to have ocd. But, if all these things i experience are ocd, then I've had it since I was a tiny kid. Not being diagnosed doesn't change that. But who knows, maybe it is just the GAD... 
I just really really really want to nip the obsessive clean thing in the bud, because it's causing trouble for my family and I just can't frankly deal with another thing rn lol...

Uhh, yeah, thanks for reading all this if you got his far :)

Ever since I was young, especially when dealing with anxiety or OCD, I’ve felt like I’ve had a hard time expressing my thoughts and feelings to others.

I recently came across the term alexithymia, which makes sense to me. Usually it’s associated with autism, but it seems like there could be some link to OCD as well. This also makes some sense to me since during times of high stress and anxiety, when my OCD tends to kick in even more so, my mind gets “stuck” in rumination.

1mlc6go,Real Event OCD --> Revenge OCD?,"TL;DR: I'm looking for help on how to resolve the need for revenge against people who've wronged me in the past. This desire is closely related to my Real Event OCD, for which I've had success with medications but the Revenge OCD remains.

QUICK BACKGROUND ON MY REAL EVENT OCD

All of my obsessions are related to how people have unfairly wronged me in the past, usually at work. My compulsions usually consist of me rehearsing out loud of what I could have said in the situation to prevent the unfair outcome or how to come out on top after. What I rehearse out loud is often full of anger but I have also realized that while some of these things feel good to say, they wouldn't be effective so I sometimes practice rehearsing more emotionally intelligent things to say. Although these compulsions are exhausting, they have also allowed me to uncover some insights into how some of my prior interactions might have helped lead to the outcomes as well as detect what might have also happened ""behind the scenes."" It has also taught me some lessons and tactics that I have used to my benefit in other work situations. However, I could have arrived at a lot of the same conclusions a lot earlier if not for the intense emotional fog related to these situations.

My compulsions are not all related to imaginary verbal confrontations though. Some veer into a violent fantasyland, either where I get into a physical altercation or the mafia shows up during the verbal confrontation and, at my behest, does something even more violent to the person who wronged me. I know these are completely realistic and would never happen. 

REVENGE

The above have been very effectively treated with medications. As long as I stay consistent with the medications, the thoughts and the talking out loud stop. What I still obsess about is revenge against someone who wronged me in the distant past. With this person, the situation didn't lend itself to where I could have said the right thing. In fact, I have to acknowledge that he made a decision that was in his best interest, even knowing that the effect to me was unfair. To him, I guess I was just collateral damage. I still think he could have been more upfront about it rather than making up excuses that he didn't know certain details, something I know that isn't true. My career and mental health has been severely negatively affected by his decision, even several years after the fact. I did something as revenge that did affect him to a small degree, but it was because I didn't go through with everything that I want to, something that could destroy him publicly and permanently.

I should mention that I have enacted some revenge in the past. 

Dish-served-cold revenge: With one person, I got a story printed about him in a large newspaper about something he was involved with that was illegal, more than a year after we no lon. Although he wasn't charged with a crime (someone else was ultimately convicted), he at least got a permanent stain on his name, that has followed him since. He probably suspects I was involved with it, but he doesn't know for sure as he made many enemies. Unfortunately, it didn't affect him to a noticeable level. He is now extremely wealthy.

Dish-served-hot revenge: With some toxic bosses who were extremely disrespectful to me as well as others, I eventually got them into trouble with the company to the point where they were pushed out and had to find a new job before they were formally fired. Before I did anything, I would obsess about what I should have said to them earlier. The fact I was able to cause them harm and they know that it was me has severely relieved my obsessions regarding them.

THEORY AND ADVICE NEEDED

I suspect that while the Revenge OCD is fueled by the same resentment underlying the Real Event OCD, it is not treatable by the same kind and/or amount of medication because it is not about things I should have said in the past; it is about what I should do in the present and future. Someone in my OCD support group also mentioned that my OCD may also be related to a kind of morality-based OCD. Fairness has always been important to me, to the point where I also have less 

From what I've read online, therapists say that revenge doesn't solve anything, that getting revenge doesn't absolve the feelings and may lead to guilt about the revenge. For me, this hasn't been the case at all. As I've mentioned above, it has led to relief and I feel no guilt whatsoever, especially since colleagues aware of the specifics also believe it to be appropriate given what these people have also done to others.

Despite the pay-off from getting revenge, I still would rather be free of my obsession with it. Just like with any other kind of OCD, it takes away from things I should be focusing on, such as my career and personal relationships (both have suffered).

But I don't know how to let go. I've tried forgiveness by stating out loud and writing how I forgive these people for what they've done but it hasn't worked.

Has anyone had any success overcoming the desire for revenge? I would very much appreciate your input. If you have the same kind of obsessions, please feel free to DM.

I have been in therapy since last summer which was also when i was diagnosed with EOCD. Since then, my therapist and i organized an ERP hierarchy surrounding my fear of death and a false reality/solipsism. After performing several exposures i noticed my rumination slowly disappearing over the course of a year but i recently experienced a severe relapse this june after a family member passed. My experiences these past few months have led me to believe that i must accept that death is inevitable and find some sort of peace with it rather than the ways that i treat my other obsessive thoughts, i.e resisting compulsions or accepting uncertainty, as i’m more scared of the fact that i’m going to die rather than what happens after, so i can’t really respond in a ‘maybe, maybe not’ or ‘who knows’ format. I am prepping to undergo the same exposures i did throughout last year but just looking to hear from people who have dealt with / recovered from similar themes and/or what helped you navigate and accept death — how should i be treating my thoughts surrounding it?

do you guys have any tips on how to stop this madness? do i try to not check twitter at all or the opposite - expose myself to it and try to not care about what i see there? how do i deal with worrying about a person that i can’t personally talk to? i feel so alone in this, because yes, ppl with ocd often worry about their loved ones like family and stuff, but a celebrity? i havent seen any posts about this, i feel so insane. 
sometimes idk what’s ocd and what is just me being weird and parasocial. but what keeps me ""sane"" is that i do notice my ocd themes changing because some months ago i was crazy anxious and obsessing about tragic world events like wars etc. and now it has completely passed, i dont spiral over it at all. but i have this current issue and im so tired. i kinda even wish i still had my previous theme and not this because on top of everything this is just so sad because my idol and his music and all that should be my source of joy, not the opposite.

It was summer and I was staying at my grandma's house. A lot of bad stuff had already happened because of my ocd back at home, so my grandma would temporarily take care of me. At first, it was cool because I loved staying over at her house, but then I became a nuisance again. I damaged the walls in my room, I slammed the bathroom door so many times, I jumped up and down on the floor, etc. I broke my nails, my fists became more swollen, I had bruises on my body from hitting it against stuff, and my legs hurt from all the jumping off stuff. I dont think they could sleep well those nights. And I was left breathless from those compulsions, it was so physical and required so much energy that it was such a nuisance to do when I was already focused on something/ wanted to relax. But what really hurt was when it was brought to my senses how much it really affected my grandma. I was told she was crying and was scared for me, and by then I felt very guilty. At the time, I was denying that I was suffering from something and thought that ""it would all end eventually"". ""Just one more hit against the table and it will all stop."" I thought if I just did one last compulsion, it would all stop. And I continued to think that way 100 compulsions later. And then it moved onto affecting how I spoke, how I walked, how I THOUGHT, how I BREATHED, how I blinked, how I swallowed, I couldn't escape it. Living was too much work at this point, it was too much. Every single thing I could do at all at any time had me doing weird stuff until it was ""just right"". Nothing was OCD free, not even going into the car or walking outside or opening a door or plugging in my phone or petting my cat. So, it got to the point where all I really did was stay in my bed and sometimes get up to use the restroom. I couldn't go outside or do anything too drastic with my breathing or movements. I had to be still and on my bed. My phone wasn't free of this either because I had a habit of hitting it if I touched it ""wrong"". So, I was just constantly exhausted and sad. I desperately wanted to go outside and have fun, but it hurt too much to not do what my mind kept telling me to. And so, for weeks, I stayed doing absolutely nothing in my grandma's house, trying to find comfort in whatever I could on my phone. And that was truly horrible.",1754698434.0,2,0,OCD,ocd

Sorry if I'm asking something that's been brought up frequently - reading too much about OCD tends to be a little bit of a trigger for me, so I tend to avoid it for the most part and so am not super well-versed in this subreddit. I did give it a quick google and nothing came up, so hope this is ok!

I've had compulsive behaviours for so long, and they became much worse when I started living on my own at c. 17. I've since gone to therapy and am doing much better, but now I'm ten years older and struggling with one thing: habits. Because when tidying up, doing the dishes, etc, is always a potential trigger (I sometimes struggle with moving objects without moving them again and again lmao) it's already something I'd prefer to avoid when I'm not feeling my best, but when I *am* feeling fine the issue is this: I used to feel like if I didn't do the dishes, cleaned up, do whatever, people would die or some shit - you know the drill. But now the stakes are gone; why do the dishes when the stakes are not life or death? This is my primary question, basically. **How to form habits when the stakes have lowered?**

I feel like in the years when I'd normally form those habits I kind of missed the boat - I was never able to incorporate them healthily; either they'd fall to the wayside when my anxiety got bad or I'd only do them because otherwise Something Bad would happen. But I'd love to just have my life in order finally; anyone any advice?

1mle448,Spiders,"Ive never liked spiders but it was never a big deal, i wasnt scared if them and they didn't bother me unless i saw one at night. 

I have always thought what if i wake up and its crawling on me or worse in my mouth (even though i know how unlikely that is now and how irrational it is). 

Before i found out that ""everyone eats 8 spiders"" in there lifetime was faulse, i think that started the problem, then even though i knew it was wrong, as my ocd got worse so did my obsessive thoughts about them.

Its gotten to the point where I am unsure if im seeing spider or i am hallucinating them because ill see them for a split second and then GONE and i cant find them... but that also means i cant kill them or get a glass and take it outside... meaning i cant sleep. 

It took me 32hours to sleep the other week because i saw one and then it dissapeared. 

When i am at my boyfriends i make him either kill them or take them out, his choice. This week there has been one in the corner of the room that hadn't moved so my bf said hes not gonna kill it unless it moves because apparently it had been still for weeks.

I would keep an eye on it, checking multiple times before sleeping. 


This morning it was still there but we went shops and when we came back it mived to the bottom corner or the room. It was covered in cobwebs and my bf didnt wanna get his hands in cobwebs.

Eventually we sorted it out but the idea of it staying there made me feel like spiders where all over me and I started to panic cry because i just wanted to take a nap.

because ive only really had issues with spiders when my obsessions get worse, and i never considered myself scared of them before, just hating the idea of them on me (im autistic and dont like light touch anyways/ swallowing spiders is pretty much something nobody wants to do).

I know i should expose myself to them but i legit cant sleep knowing their there, idrk what to do, especially since half the time if im on my own they may not even be real.

I’ve been dealing with anxiety and OCD for quite a while, and I recently decided to get some lab work done to see if there might be any underlying factors influencing my symptoms. Here are my results:

* **TSH:** 3.88 uUI/ml (range: 0.35–4.94)
* **Free T4 (T4L):** 10 pmol/ml (range: 9.00–19.05)
* **Free T3 (T3L):** 4.56 pmol/ml (range: 2.43–6.01)

1ml04bq,How to accept what the doctors have said to me?,"Let me start with, I have booked an appointment with an OCD psychologist for Monday. 
In the meantime, I need somewhere to put this cycle because it's got me in a bad hold, and I'm having daily panic attacks. 

My new “obsession” is rabies. Through this sub, I have come to know that this is a common theme for a lot of people with OCD. 

I was on a family vacation at a family resort close to where I live in Canada. Lots of families and Pets go here. I was on the private beach that this resort owns, and it's not uncommon for people to have their leashed Pets with them. 
I was walking on the beach, and a king cavalier dog, as I was walking past, where it was with its family, came up to me and just jumped up on my legs, looking for a pet, wagging its tail, and then it gave me a couple of licks. 
Hopped back down and went back to its spot under the sun tent. It was also on a long leash attached to the sun tent. 

I didn't think anything of it, really. 
But now this week a thought popped into my head of maybe this dog had rabies and licked my leg and hand and I had some tiny little cuts on. 
Because I can't observe the dog my spirals are crazy. 
I called my local public health and spoke to an officer who deals with possible rabies exposures and they said based on the circumstances this is considered very low risk and the only reason they can't say 100% is because they can't observe the dog. 
However they did say they don't recommend PEP or shots at this time, however, a doctor has to make the final call and any doctor is able to access. I went to an urgent care and the doctor accessed it, she also spoke to public health while I was there and they both concluded that no other steps are required and the risk is quite minuscule. 

I mean OCD clearly doesnt care about logic and I'm struggling with accepting what they have said. 
And I keep going back and obsessing over the moment. Did I miss something? Why didn't I pay more attention to the dog? Was it foaming? I could have sworn I had a bandaid on and now I can't remember if I did and i just hate OCD so much and I hate false memory OCD.

I am crying writing this because I'm tired of the spiral. 

Any tips on how to accept what the professionals said? ",1754671078.0,3,12,OCD,ocd
1ml94wp,Help labelling thoughts,"There are various things I obsess over and my compulsion is to confess to loved ones (typically my bf). One of the more upsetting obsessions of mine is fear that I have SA’d someone in the past and I don’t know if it’s an OCD thought or real. 

Some important context - I’ve never received an official diagnosis (thanks to long NHS waitlists) but I have previously worked with a therapist who thought it likely based on my symptoms and helped treat me with ERP. 

Back to why I’m stuck: I had a series of sexual partners in my late teens/early 20s when I was figuring things out and I often find myself  cataloging those experiences in my mind to ‘check’ that I’ve never taken advantage of someone. One instance that stands out in my mind is from over a decade ago. I don’t remember much, other than a vague memory that a close friend of mine at the time (who was also the guy I had my first time with and had a loose fwb situation with) was upset and I was comforting him. One thing led to another and we did ‘the deed’. I have a deep fear that I took advantage of his sadness and manipulated him into have s*x with me. This thought first occurred to me at the end of last year - over a decade after the fact and without any concrete evidence of this ever occurring. I continued to socialise with this person for a while after the incident (we don’t talk anymore and I wouldn’t feel comfortable reaching out about something like this) and remained friends with the wider group (one of whom would go on to be his gf for a few years) for many years following. 


I assume had something bad happened it would have been mentioned and the fact that these thoughts only first occurred to me at the end of last year suggest to me that this is possibly OCD, rather than real. The issue is I can’t tell if this is an OCD thought or a real thought. If the former I know I shouldn’t do anything and just sit with the uncertainty. But if it’s a genuine fear I feel like I need to figure out if I did commit SA and try and apologise to the victim. It feels different to most of my other suspected OCD thoughts as it’s based in a real life event (as opposed to the horrible made up things I typically experience with intrusive thoughts).

1ml26i8,What I've Done For ERP Today (Flooding) - i'd like some feedback and suggestions,"i have an obsession with keeping my skin from getting damaged by the sun, and today i decided to go to the beach with no sunscreen or sunglasses for about 45 minutes, then i went to the park with only some sunscreen on my face. I will definitely get a sunburn today because i have pale skin and live in a tropical climate, and actually i can already feel it beginning to form. ive made a rule for myself that i can only start regularly applying sunscreen again once my distress fades enough to the point where i dont care if i go outside with or without sun protection. I also decided to lay on my bed after getting in the ocean and contaminating it. 

Today was very stressful but I feel much more confident. Its kind of hard to know how far/long to keep this going though, because putting myself at such a risk of skin cancer may seem extreme. But what i realized is that my father has far more sun damage than me, has had benign skin cancer removed, and yet he is still HAPPIER and MORE FULFILLED than I am. I wore sunscreen on only a 50/50 basis as a kid and was also happier. I'm chasing after comfort that doesnt exist. I someday dream of hiking the pacific crest trail and that wont be possible if im scared of sun damage. its really difficult to realize that in order to achieve your dreams you have to face insurmountable objects like this in the present. I'm also scared that no one will ever love me and will find me disgusting due to this. I would appreciate some kind words (not reassurance), as well. If you have any ideas on how to add on to this and make it even more effective then please do tell me. Lately whenever I start ruminating about all of this my response is just ""well I would rather get skin cancer, photokeratosis, and die than capitulate to my ocd"" which i think is helping me build confidence.

Ultimately I need to stop checking my phone and will try that at the same time (notifications are never on for Reddit I’ve just opened the app 47 times today according to my Be Present app), but I am hoping this might be a backup and this feels like the more direct exposure anyway.

1mkziuu,How do I get around this?,"Hey guys, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD with themes of ROCD and also morality and being a “good” person. 

Some quick background, I ended a relationship with my ex 5 months ago, although there were valid reasons for a break up (future plans didn’t line up), there was definitely some impulsivity and OCD at play, it was very messy and even though I broke up with them, I’m finding I’m still pretty messed up. I’m also a DA if that adds to anything. 

Anyways, I thought I was ready to date again so I got on dating apps and met some people. One person, we’ll call her Olivia was someone who at the start I really gelled with, but as time went on I started to freak out and wonder if this was right for me and if I was even fully ready to date in the first place. Another big fear I have is, if I get into a relationship and it’s not a “perfect fit” it will end horrifically like my last relationship and I’ll end up hurting another person. So I told them, let’s keep it platonic, and we hung out in person but with the label as friends. And that’s where we are now. 

Where my problem begins is, I think the moment I get triggered, and I still don’t know what my trigger is, I ruminate excessively and get an anxious stomach that doesn’t go away. 24/7 stomach ache and feeling sick. Whenever I think of Olivia, even when I want to be JUST FRIENDS with them, and they are okay with that too. I feel sick and I feel the impulsive need to block them and never speak to them again. When they have been nothing but nice to me and I don’t see why I feel the need to block them. I only block people who are mean or bad people, yet Olivia simply is someone I get along with and want to be friends with yet, my brain is telling my the only way to stop this anxious stomach is to block them. 

Maybe I do have feelings for them, or could and that’s causing me to freak out? I really don’t know what to do here because I don’t want to fall to my compulsion to block someone for relief, but it’s been a week of this and I feel like I’m falling apart. 

Any insight helps, thank you.

Edit:

Also I’ll add, this feelings has made me avoid texting them and voice calling them, even thought I have a lot of fun while on call or hanging out with them…

This may be reassurance seeking I'm not entirely sure but I also feel like I need to rant. 

My ocd feels like it's getting worse. I came off sertraline after 9 years and tried a new medication fluoxetine and honestly feel like it hasn't made any difference at all. Im currently on 60mg. 

My thoughts have always been harm related and pocd occasionally as well. Recently it feels like my thoughts are getting out of control but they're so random. 

The other night I spiralled for the full night thinking I was a pedophile and the next day I just didn't feel as scared. Then today I had a really random thought of what if I became addicted to food and my health got really bad then for no reason at all I thought about the opposite of what if I become anorexic and that thought has terrified me. Part of me understands this is ocd thinking but another part of me is so confused like why my thoughts feel so random at the minute and it feels like EVERYTHING is scaring me. Im so terrified of everything - I'm scared of becoming depressed, I'm scared of self harm, I'm scared of my health, I'm scared of my mental health becoming worse and I just don't know how to handle all these fears. 

Im aware I may be seeking reassurance but also I just don't know what to do right now. And this random 'what if I have an eating disorder' has really scared me but literally came from nowhere. (I have no history of eating disorders)

1ml498n,What to do when rational fears/suspicions/uncertainties are like catnip to your OCD?,"
I’ve been able to shelve anxious obsessions surrounding irrational ideas (e.g., I believed a plane would crash if I didn’t imagine it crashing in every way possible— the “logic” being that humans can’t predict the future).

What I can’t deal with, however, are my thoughts locking onto a valid suspicions or very real uncertainties.  Often times it will be someone else’s bizarre behavior that leads me to feel validly suspicious; for example, I’ve caught two different people in lies, before, and even though I did nothing about it except yield to their manipulation and cut ties, my rumination became obsessive.  I continued to care because they’d treated me poorly and seemed like personalities who would be dangerous to encounter again in the future.  After entire years, my mind wasn’t satisfied even after trying to make sense of the situations and patterns of behavior from basically every angle I could think up (including plenty which denied the facts and my own perspective and tried to give the other people any benefit of the doubt). 

I went down a spiral of, ‘I’m thinking so hard about this, and that in itself is abnormal, so there must be something wrong with me.  Would someone with a stronger belief in themselves have simply let this go and moved on?  What if I’m all wrong, and my perception of reality is warped— even though the facts I know to be true wouldn’t make sense anymore, if such was the case?’  This led to a lot of debilitating self-doubt and questioning of reality, which led to a lot of self-isolation.  

That’s all to say, I’m in trauma therapy now that the symptoms have become so debilitating.

For some reason, I have this persistent, obsessive feeling like I need to cut off my leg. I don’t want to act on it. I don’t believe it would help anything. There’s no physical injury. But my brain keeps telling me something’s wrong with it, like there’s a “corruption” in my body or like it just doesn’t belong.

The worst part? It doesn’t feel like just a thought. It feels like an instinct, like something deeper than logic. My instincts usually guide me well in life, I actually trust them a lot. But this one? It’s like a rogue instinct, completely irrational, yet it won’t go away. And because it feels like instinct, it’s hard to ignore.

I’m fully aware this is likely part of my OCD. It’s like my brain has generated a false alarm and keeps sounding it over and over, even though there’s no fire. I can think clearly, I know it’s irrational, but the feeling just won’t let go.

1mkut8u,I feel like I am not controlling my life,"I have dealt with traumatic experiences through injuries ( Non abusive ) and sexual trauma ( non abusive ) growing up.

1mkqhvp,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my OCD journey in case it helps someone else feel less alone.","Looking back, I realize I've had OCD since I was a kid. Around age 6 or 7, I thought my brother was ""gross"" after he got sick, and I started avoiding food he touched. I even cried if he handed me something. Later, I became obsessed with burping. I thought it was disgusting and would wave the air away with my hands. By 8 or 9, I had severe handwashing OCD. My hands would crack and bleed from overwashing. Around age 10, my OCD shifted to bathroom rituals. I would wipe obsessively after pooping to the point of bleeding, fixated on doing it ""right"" and constantly asked my mom things like ""how many times do you wipe?"" That ritual stuck with me for years and still affects me today, although I've improved a lot thanks to buying a bidet.

In high school and college, I had random episodes of health OCD. I believed I had an STD or cancer even though there was no logical reason. I also became obsessed with the idea that my friends didn't like me. That might have been social OCD or maybe just insecurity. Later, I developed a fear of sudden diarrhea and carried tummy pills with me everywhere. In 2024, I developed a fear of vomiting. I never actually threw up, but I felt sick constantly and took Dramamine with me all the time. I would sometimes gag and feel better afterward, which weirdly relieved the anxiety

Now in 2025, I've been struggling with harm OCD. This theme hit me out of nowhere and feels completely alien to my usual experience. Unlike my past themes, which always felt logical or self-focused, this one brings intense anxiety and fear. It's the first time OCD has made me afraid of hurting other people, which makes it so much more distressing. Still, looking back, I can finally see the OCD pattern throughout my life, even in moments I didn't realize were part of it.

And..... my harm ocd morphed into meta-ocd where I convinced myself I was a psychopath and lacked ghe ability to feel anything....

What I'm getting at is ive been feeling a lot better this past week remembering that what it is im experiencing is pretty much textbook ocd. Its sometimes hard to see and to forget where you've been in the past with ocd and its important to remember your old themes.  What seemed impossible then is old news today. And what scares you today will be old news tomorrow ;).

1mkzpee,What am i even dealing with at this point ?,"Hello ! Hope you are having a great day.

So starting out strong, i love familial and hurt/comfort scenes in media. And i love writing about, they just scratch this kinda itch (relevant to the post, trust) . But...

My body reacts to it with lubrication. That's what causing me distress. (And i am religious so it's even more distressing)

So it started in the summer of last year, i started to indulge in hurt/comfort found family stories. Then it started to build in my mind that I am doing it for sex\*al pleasure. I fought those thoughts, even joked about them in my head until September where i read something about them in a fit of fear (big mistake) and it became bad...

...then i fought them off ! Whole uni year, whole groinal responses package. One night at my dorm i just hit the ""it is what it is"" , and life been kinda good. (Kinda).

So now it's this year's summer, and it's kinda coming back.what gave me this doubt was how as time went on the rest of the groinal responses package slowly disappeared...Except for the lubrication , and that put me in the edge of that feeling of fear again, it doesn't help that I've been going through life changes. And every post i found is always about the groinal responses appearing for them in response to intrusive thoughts that they don't like. which confused me bc idk which thoughts are the intrusive ones or if i even have them. I don't wanna relapse to that zone y'know, it's scary.

I still think about the area, even when i am literally doing nothing, it's like i am constantly guarding (to be fair i am, even when i say I don't care i still feel happy when there's nothing. And i think i might have been ""testing"" and getting mad when it doesn't react appropriately (as in acceptable situations. I've been trying to show myself it can react in other non related situations...like what the articles say)

So should i continue what i am doing ? Should i just clean and not care (or would that be me doing avoidance ?) or should i confront the ""evidence"" and just accept it and not care afterwards ?  U could say i already relapsed with the reassurance seeking and i guess i never rlly got rid of the hate and shame i feel (but 2 months is a good time, right ?)

1mkgd11,"My girlfriend has OCD and I'd like to be supportive, but I don't know how.","I'm M34 and my girlfriend is F26. We've been together for about four months now and have known each other for about five months. We had broken up a few times before because there were a few times that we were supposed to hang out and she just completed ghosted me for days. However, something about our connection always brought us back together. She eventually told me that she has OCD, but it didn't click that that was why this kept happening until one week it got really bad. There was about a week where there were days I wouldn't hear from her at all, and if I did, it was 2-3 text messages tops. That's when I decided to look into what OCD was to see what I could learn to help her and to help our relationship. She was floored that I took time to learn about it and she said it's the most heard that she's ever felt in a relationship. She's started opening up more about her intrusive thoughts and I can tell that she's putting in more effort to be present in the relationship, however there are days when she goes almost completely silent and I don't hear from her. We've come up with a way for her to communicate that she feels an OCD coming on and we've talked about her trying to communicate as minimally as possible during episodes but sometimes she just doesn't, and as someone that doesn't have OCD, that gets difficult to wrap my head around. 

She's shared with me that her OCD type is called Pure O, and everything is mostly mental, she doesn't have many physical compulsions. In the reading that I've done, I've heard that that is one of the most intense forms of OCD. 

I am autistic, and I have an anxious attachment style. So, I tend to get very anxious when I start to not hear anything from her from awhile. And as someone with autism, I like to make plans, and when things don't go according to plan, I start having a meltdown. Not only does it affect making plans to hang out, but it makes me not want to make future scheduled plans, especially if we're going to plan on something that we have to pre-pay for. A few weeks ago I had to cancel a trip that we had planned for her to meet my mom. It was something that we had planned ahead of time and it was something that I had to cancel with no communication from her, it just got to the day we were supposed to go and I still hadn't heard from her. One thing specifically that I'm anxious about, is we are planning to go to my cousin's wedding and get a hotel room. We aren't well off by any means, we both need to buy formal attire for the wedding and split the hotel room. I'm just nervous that we're going to put money into all of this and then she has an OCD episode and then we wasted all of that money for something we didn't go to. 

I'm not looking for advice on how to fix her so my life becomes more convenient, I know that it's going to take compromise and hard work and I'm willing to put in the work, I just don't know how to help her, and she doesn't know/doesn't know how to communicate what she needs from me. The hardest part is that we don't live together, so usually the only communication I'll have with her is through text, so most of the time I don't know if she's even seen my messages.

1mkxi4r,I need help,"For most of my life, I’ve lived with OCD and I never really questioned it that much. I’d adjust things repeatedly until they felt “right,” check things over and over, and spend extra time making sure I was clean. I always thought it was just part of my personality, I thought maybe I was just a germaphobe or an overthinker. Since it didn’t interfere too much with my daily life, I didn’t give it much attention.

But everything changed about five weeks ago.
Out of nowhere, my heart was racing so hard, and I felt nauseous and had to go to the hospital. It turned out to be caused by a vitamin D deficiency, but the panic and fear that hit me that day didn’t go away. Instead, they opened the door to my OCD, which suddenly became impossible to ignore. like this tome it's not just discomfort, it's literal burning in my heart, it's my brain telling me: GET UP RIGHT NOW AND DO IT.

Since that day, my mind has been on high alert, anxious, worried, and unsettled every hour I’m awake. The thoughts that used to come and go now feel constant and urgent. The compulsions that used to be manageable (which I were fighting, and actually started getting better) now consume hours of my day. And the worst part is the cleanliness obsessionit has taken over my nights.
Something as simple as getting ready for bed has turned into a nightmare. I might brush my teeth and wash my face, then go to lie down. But my brain won’t let me rest. It says, “Maybe a splash of water hit the sink and bounced back onto your skin.” That tiny doubt grows into anxiety, and I feel forced to get up and wash again. I'm repeating, it's not just discomfort, it's burning. Sometimes this hours.

My hands are so raw and damaged from overwashing. My sleep is broken, my energy is drained, and my heart is constantly racing. It feels like I’m trapped in a loop of fear and repetition. And what's worse is that no one around me seems to understand.
see, in my country, OCD isn't seen as a mental health condition. matter of fact, it's not really a thing here. People see it as “overthinking” or think I’m just being too clean. That makes it even harder, because I’m dealing with something serious and real, but I feel completely alone in it.

Still, I’ve started to learn more about OCD and how it works. I now understand that this isn’t just about being clean, it’s a cycle of obsession, anxiety, and compulsion. And even though I don’t have access to therapy or support nearby, I’m trying to fight back. and openedfor advices.",1754665163.0,1,6,OCD,ocd

I have chronic depression, and in the last few weeks I've been ""discovering"" my OCD (I've had hygiene OCD since childhood, but I never paid it any attention). This is thanks to a recent trigger at work: I started a company with someone I met through LinkedIn, and I've been obsessed with him ever since.

This has gone through all the phases: thinking I'm jealous, thinking I liked him romantically, feeling sorry for myself, and getting angry at him. But right now, it's debilitating, and I'm even considering leaving the company we started together. I get anxious for him to text me, and when he does, I get angry (maybe because it's not what I expected). He's a good and understanding person, and he even recommended a therapist for my OCD, but I'm constantly consumed by thoughts of how he's better looking than me, happier than me, smarter than me, more sociable than me. It's like he's a better version of me.

1mkgrv8,OCD crisis led to nervous system collapse & insomnia — anyone relate?,"I’m 28 years old, a college student, and until recently, I thought sleep was one of the few things in life I could always count on.

It began innocently enough — strange, unwanted thoughts popping into my head. *“What if you feel like doing Y or Z?”*they’d whisper. The thoughts were absurd, almost laughable, and at first, I brushed them aside. But they kept coming back. More often. Louder.

Soon, I was arguing with them in my head all day long. The more I fought, the stronger they became. It felt like living with an invisible enemy who knew exactly how to twist my words. If I thought of something imprecisely, they’d treat it like a confession. Sometimes I’d be having a normal thought, and they’d hijack it, finishing it with something I’d never intend — then immediately accuse me of meaning it.

Each time, my heart would pound, adrenaline flooding my body as if I’d been startled a hundred times a day.

Then they began following me into my dreams. I’d wake up already in fight-or-flight mode, ready to defend myself before the day even began.

One day, everything lost its color. The world felt flat, empty, unreal. That night, something I’d never experienced happened: I couldn’t sleep.

Not “restless” — I mean not at all. I lay in the dark, watching the hours crawl by. Every time I started to drift off, my heart would jolt me awake. Fear kept me wired. By morning, I realized: my nervous system had collapsed.

From that night on, something had changed. It was as if insomnia had been *unlocked* in my brain. Some nights I’d sleep okay, others barely at all. But the worst part wasn’t the bad nights — it was losing that warm, natural drowsiness that always came before sleep.

Before this, I loved afternoon naps. My eyelids would grow heavy, and I’d sink into rest without effort. Now, that feeling is gone — or worse, it’s there but blocked. In all these months, I’ve only truly felt it a handful of times. The last was about a month ago, after I prayed with everything in me. That night, I slept seven uninterrupted hours.

In the beginning, I wasted time with a so-called “holistic therapist” who claimed my problem was loneliness and not living life to the fullest. Imagine it: my mind in the middle of a war, my body exhausted, my sleep shattered — and his advice was, *“Forget about sleep, just live your life.”* He sold me rescue remedies and empty promises.

Eventually, I walked away and saw a psychiatrist. She diagnosed me with OCD and prescribed Lamotrigine. I’m at 50 mg now, aiming for 100.

It’s been two and a half months since the night it all began. I still can’t believe how something as basic as sleep — once as automatic as breathing — could suddenly become a stranger. The intrusive thoughts are gone, but the damage they caused remains.

So far, I haven’t used anything to induce sleep, though I may have to — just to teach my brain how to shut off again and, hopefully, unlock my natural drowsiness.

I believe I’m getting better. Sleep is slowly improving… but every sleepless night feels like a huge setback.

All I want is to find my way back — to unlock that drowsiness, to close my eyes, and know, without doubt, that sleep will come. ",1754612721.0,10,5,OCD,ocd

1mkgm9e,My recovery journey,"I feel like I’m finally at a place where I can share my recovery journey to make people who are suffering from the same problem feel more hopeful and optimistic.

My issues with mental health started last summer. I was a fresh graduate and couldn’t find a job or an internship no matter how much effort I put into trying. The uncertainty about my future coupled with the feeling of falling behind in life made me very anxious, but I dismissed it until I started experiencing some health issues.

I became so obsessed with my physical well-being and kept going to the hospital to check everything I thought was wrong with me. Then one day I came home with my dad. Everything was fine until I started eating lunch and felt like something about my surroundings was off. Panic started to build up and I freaked out because I thought I was going insane.

That was my first full-blown panic attack ever. Luckily my dad knew exactly what I was going through and helped me calm down. Turned out his sister and my mom went through the same when they were younger, so they played a huge part in helping me navigate through those terrible times. Mom had a book about panic attacks so I reached out to the author who later became my psychologist.

My therapy was helping a lot by reducing the physical symptoms of panic attacks and anxiety, like trembling, racing heart and dizziness, but my mental state was getting worse. I went from not experiencing any intrusive thoughts at all to having them almost every second of my day and it had taken such a huge toll on me at that time. 

The thoughts were by far the worst aspect of this whole experience.
It was so exhausting that after two months I decided to make an appointment with a doctor. She listened to the utter nonsense I came up with to describe what was going on in my head and diagnosed me with OCD. Looking back, I wish I had come to her sooner. She helped me so much by reassuring me and prescribing the right medication. 

Although my symptoms seemed severe to me, I started feeling so much better even on a minimal dose and I had no side effects whatsoever.

Some time later, I went through the loss of my dear grandma and two job rejections in a row, but I still managed to get better despite my problems. I kept reminding myself that everything I feel and think due to OCD is just a symptom of it. The best thing I could do for myself was accepting everything that was happening and helping my nervous system recover.

I just imagined that I was recovering from a very bad flu and it helped tremendously. Months passed and I felt so much better. The number of intrusive thoughts I had in a day decreased dramatically and it made me so happy and hopeful. The other day I caught myself thinking that I hadn’t had a single intrusive thought until 10 p.m. and I’ve never felt so relieved.

Right now I’m slowly reducing the dose of my medication and don’t feel any side effects except the sleepiness during the first few days. 

I’m wishing everyone who’s currently struggling with anxiety a speedy recovery. Take care of yourself and remember that things do get better.

I’d be happy to share the tips and lifestyle changes I made in order to help me get better if needed.

1mkq5zt,Sudden severe OCD episode,"TW- digestive, emeto and poop talk, this is entirely what my ocd surrounds, sorry 😭

I have always had OCD around my stomach health, as my anxiety makes me feel nauseous and upsets my stomach generally.
Recent years it has entirely been around the possibility of me getting diarrhoea. I have got IBS as well which for me means I will get an diarrhoea at least once every 1-2 weeks. 

It’s gotten a lot worse recently, I have had to carry anti-diarrhoea meds with me everywhere I go out of fear, even at home. And I’ve been taking it as a precaution when I even start to feel my stomach get weird. I’m so outrageously scared of my own stomach that any feeling sends me spiralling, which in turn, makes my stomach actually get sick. 

If anyone is similar and has been able to break out of their dependency on meds and NOT freak out everytime they leave the house, any advice would be greatly appreciated.
(Also I do believe my stomach health is entirely stress related, I always get sick at the same time of day, dinner, which I find very stressful. Even with this knowledge, it doesn’t help) ",1754643514.0,1,2,OCD,ocd

now i’m panicking because i cant tell if that was some bat bites that just bled or not. i’m wearing a sweater with red on it that’s kind of easy to fall off, and my guess is the thread somehow caught onto the part of the blanket i was wiping it with, and it made it look like i was bleeding.

Also used the tube daily. I hate trains and subways because of obvious reasons (the tracks). But taking an Uber to every place not within walking distance is not currently financially feasible. So the tube it was. Even though there were bouts of nervousness, panic, and general anxiety/unease.

But I made it through the trip.

So today was kind of weird. I finally got in to see a therapist after waiting 6 months (Canada wait times 🙃).

Before this, I was in another program where I got assessed by a psychiatrist. My official diagnoses back then were ADHD, GAD, SAD, and a traumatic stress disorder. No mention of OCD.

But today, in my session, my new therapist was going over notes from that previous program and casually mentioned that apparently I also have OCD. Like… excuse me?? This is the first I’m hearing of it.

I told my sister (who actually has OCD) and she said she doesn’t think I do. But then I remembered that last year, when I was in the hospital after an attempt, the psychologist there said they saw OCD-type symptoms in me — but they never officially diagnosed me either.

The weird thing is, I’m having trouble even figuring out what behaviours gave them that indication and what’s normal considering all my other diagnoses? Years ago, I used to check door locks a lot, but that’s mostly faded. I have a feeling it might be more to do with reassurance seeking, but I’m not sure.

She has been doing ERP for this however she has been put in a situation where she has had to be home alone for a few weeks which seems to worsen the anxiety substantially. She has been struggling to sleep on nights I'm not there and she had a panic attack when I arrived late last night after she called me and asked me to come there. It's unrealistic to never be home alone at night and in the event she actually has forgot to lock up it could pose a legitimate risk, but checking is obviously a massive no-no.

Every time I try to leave the bed I just end up freaking myself out and going back to just numb my mind with a movie or tiktok or something. 

Staying is in bed is really bad too because I just feel like I’m so dirty and contaminated and I know that even taking a shower would require me to just do my normal routine 100x worse because of how dirty I feel, so I can’t even get the energy to do it because showers have become so traumatizing to me. 

I am also in the middle of trying to find a new therapist (to no avail), because none of them seem to be working or care much about OCD. I also looked into some mental health in-patient centers, but no one has an opening and I honestly think it would be more triggering to be somewhere new and be around people. I also messaged my psychologist as well (hasn’t answered yet) but I don’t really know them that well yet, and I don’t think they really realize the extent of my issues.

I was starting a new school at the time and people kept telling me “oooo you’re gonna get a boyfriend when you go to school!!” (I’m closeted) and it kept giving me episodes. So I’m order for people to immediately assume that I’m gay, I started dressing super masculine and got a really short haircut. I hated it but I thought in order for me to be gay I had to be masculine. (I know I know, you can’t assume people are gay/straight based on what they look like, but I was in a really bad headspace). I didn’t feel comfortable being hyper masculine but I did it anyway so people would stop assuming I was straight, so I wouldn’t have as many episodes. It didn’t work btw people kept assuming I was straight. 

I realized it was an ocd episode after a few days ago, when I got a really bad short haircut. I have to hide it cuz it looks so bad.

1mkdmas,I need help dealing with my friend who’s got OCD.,"Hello everyone ! I’m seeking some help in the understanding and being supportive with my new friend and new coloc who has OCD (I do NOT have OCD)

I’ve (20F) known this girl (21F) not long ago, like back in April. 

We are moving in together with another girl I know because we got accepted at the university of our dreams and needed to find colocs and an appartment.

Tonight, she just opened up for the 1st time about having OCD. I had no idea, but I did notice some patterns, but thought nothing of it.

The patterns being like her overthinking everything she says in a convo, fearing it could be badly interpretated. Or overly justificating details. Or apologize often - even when she really doesn’t have to ?) 

She confessed that she had this - and she knows it is- irrational fear of writing horrible things to the persons she loves and therefore she has to screen recording EVERY convos she has in order to then check she didn’t say something bad. She also records IRL convos. I have some mixed feeling about this, because…she’s been recording a lot of our IRL conversations and I didn’t even know ? 

Well, she said she KNOWS she won’t do such horrible things as she thinks could happen, but she HAS to double check every convos she has. It’s to the point she has difficulties to be aroumd screens, paper etc. cause she’s convinced she could write something horrible to someone. She has a hard time sending mails also, for this reason. 

I don’t know how I’m supposed to react. Especially since we’re gonna LIVE together, I urgently need some insights. Like…I don’t want every convos we have to be recorded ?  
Is it even normal for people with OCD to do this ?

I’m aware I surely only know the tip of the iceberg, what she chose to share with me. But I feel like I need to know some things about this condition. ",1754604452.0,1,5,OCD,ocd

But then I decided that I would listen to what my mind was telling me. That these actions were not offensive, and that acting like this was irrational. After a while, I still decided to fight it and went against my obsessive thoughts. I was anxious. Yes, at first I did not want to do anything. But then I felt lighter and freer. After several resistances to doing the ritual, I did not want to do it at all. And although some symptoms still remained, life became much easier. The world did not collapse, as I feared.

I just wanted to apologize in advance if this comes off as an “I’m sooo ocd” type of post, but I’ve read up a lot about this over the years and can definitely relate to people here who go through the same thing as me.

Lately it’s gotten way worse and my family’s being extra critical about it, especially my mom. She times my showers most of the time, and comes up to the door and goes “5 minutes left!” “Okay fineee I’ll give you an extra 3 minutes”, it’s so annoying and honestly none of her business. I get it if we’re going out as a family and I’m running late, that’s genuinely my fault. Sometimes I enter the shower hours before and still get out late because of these rituals. Like I can’t tell how long they are gonna take. But even when we’re all at home with no plans, they’re constantly on my back. I’ve explained to my mom about my rituals and it just doesn’t make sense to her. They ask me what I’m doing in there for so long, they just think it’s a bad habit rather than something I have no/very little control over. It’s fine if they ask me once or twice but they do it every single time, it feels like they enjoy having something to criticize about me rather than trying to understand me. It’s so exhausting and unfair, especially since I don’t like bringing up their shortcomings. Please if y’all have family or friends like this I would appreciate some advice

we’ve been fighting a lot the last few days. i’ve been depressed and irritable and probably haven’t been the nicest to him. he’s also been angry and distant with his emotions. he got upset with me the other day because i reacted unkindly to him trying to bust in the bathroom to show me something funny, i tried to talk through it with him and his opinion was that i had been unkind to him for days now and that im ungrateful for all his efforts to brighten my mood. i understood where he was coming from but still tried to communicate that i was experiencing deep depression and anxiety and it seemed to go nowhere. the next day we talked about it again and it seemed like he more understood where i was coming from but it still didn’t feel resolved, it still seemed like he was unhappy. today, i was continuing down the spiral, i was angry, confused, and annoyed and him trying to cheer me up was only making it worse. seemed like that broke him, he started asking me if i was even happy with him, if id rather dissolve our marriage and find other people, he shared that he feels like he makes me miserable, “you’re always annoyed or sad when im around”. the way he shared, i just starting sobbing, i couldn’t believe the way id been treating him in his eyes. i thought i was just mildly annoyed or at most meh or boring. but to know that i was making him feel like such a nuisance was heart wrenching.

1mk5o70,How to cope with isolation and mistreatment at work?,"Hello, this is my first time posting here. I have OCD that has mostly been untreated and was casually diagnosed by an online therapist a couple years ago. I never knew before then that my intrusive thoughts weren't normal, because I grew up in a fundamental Christian church and thought my obsessions with confessing my sins and being a good person were good things. In the past few years I've learned that I have always had severe OCD, including Harm OCD. I've always been constantly afraid that I'm doing something wrong or that I could easily become evil. I'm getting better, but my social development was stunted because of my OCD symptoms and my twenties mostly consisted of me trying to learn how to exist in the world. I never thought I would make it to 20 and I'm turning 30 this year. I'm proud that I was strong enough to leave religion despite no longer fitting in with my family. I have had to leave most of the people from my old life behind and have struggled with loneliness.

Anyway, I was tricked into accepting an internship in a rural town because I was promised training and mentorship in a field I was interested in, which never happened. I'm 6 months in and now just trying to survive until the end of the program in 4 months because I'm unable to get out of my lease. My project advisor doesn't respect me and has made it clear that he doesn't see me as being capable of challenging tasks, though I have proven myself in the past. He ignored the requirements of my internship program until I became so fed up that I confronted him about it in a meeting with his boss. Now he does the bare minimum to appear helpful so he doesn't get in more trouble with my internship program manager.

I have been unable to stop obsessing about my job situation outside of work. From the outside looking in, it seems like I could just happily coast until the end of this thing. The people here think I'm stupid for some reason (though I do very well with every task I'm assigned) so they don't expect me to get things done quickly. I also have barely anything to do. No one even keeps track of when I'm at work. I could not come in at all tomorrow and I doubt anyone would notice or care. I could work 8 hours a week and made it look like a week of work to them.

But I can't stop being so angry that I moved from the PNW to the Midwest for what I thought would be a good opportunity. Instead I'm being treated like I'm stupid and mostly ignored, and I'm being given tasks a ten-year-old could do. I'm so fucking mad that I have to use an EBT card to survive and that I'm only able to save $100 each month even if I never go out. I can't stop ruminating on the way my advisor treats me. I am so full of anger and hatred. Anger is a hard emotion for me because my father was an asshole/gaslighter who never allowed me to be angry at him for mistreating me, and he always made me think it was my fault. I was also taught as a kid in church that anger was a sin unless it was anger in defense of God (righteous anger), so I always doubt the validity of my anger as an adult.

  
How can I get through the rest of this year without obsessing about work? Does anyone have suggestions on how to cope with anger, especially anger related to poor treatment from other people? I tend to get stuck in a loop when I'm angry where I feel like I need to make a list of every reason I'm allowed to be mad in order to feel like my anger is valid. This just results in me going over everything that pisses me off over and over, which only stops if I get distracted. It starts to feel like I'm not in the real world anymore, and sometimes I'll come out of it and feel like I lost a big chunk of time just thinking.

My partner is trying to maintain the house, but struggling due to lacking help from them. He has spoken to them, but of course it isn’t our home and so it’s their choice if they choose to help, or not.

1mk7o51,My mother,"I am female and I have a mom who probably has OCD, especially contamination OCD. I wonder if it is maybe OCPD because she does not suffer, she thinks she is doing the right thing. 

But I suffer so much of it and I don't know what to do, because I am completely isolated and I only have my mom and she thinks she is normal and everything she does is normal. 

I used to believe her, because I grew up this way but I am starting to think that this can't be normal. 

She stopped hugging me when I was 10 years old. She claimed that her clothes are dirtier than mine and if we hug, my clothes will get dirtier and she claimed that my clothes are dirtier than hers and if we hug, her clothes will get dirtier. 

She refused to hug me all my life after that and I suffer so much because I need a hug. This does not make sense because we both had clean clothes. 

At first I did not question it, then I brought up solutions like we could both change our clothes and then hug? She refused to accept my solutions. 

A few years later I started to question it and she claimed I am not able to understand that yet and I believed her.

There are so many things she made me believe I will understand when I am older, but I still don't understand them. Only recently I realized that there is nothing to understand, because that is not normal and there is no logical reason for this.

When I was 9 years old we still used to visit people and she did not do any of the things she does at home. Suddenly hygiene was not that important. When we came back home suddenly her extreme hygiene standards were back.

When I told her: ""But when we were with aunt XY you did not do this, why do we have to do it now?"" 

She said: ""If I did this when others are present, they would think I am not normal, so I cant do it when others are present. But I am normal, the others just never learned the right hygiene. The others are all so unsanitary!"" 

Then when she sees another woman who has contamination OCD, she feels validated ""See? She also does it!""

She thinks EVERYONE EXEPT HER does not know how to be hygienic. I don't know how she doesn't see that can't be true.

She never lets me do household chores, because she claims only she knows how to do it right. I tried to do everything exactly like her and it was never enough. 

A few times I tried to clean something without her permission when I was like 13. She screamed hysterically. Once I cleaned a vase that was on a desk and I did everything right. Then she claimed that now the whole desk and everything that is on it is dirty now and now she has to clean everything. 

But she never did clean it. She forbid me to use and touch the desk and anything that is on it until she cleaned it. But she never cleaned it and I was never allowed me to use the desk again in my whole life and I had to do my homework on my bed since then.

She always ""had to"" wash my school supplies after school before I was allowed to do homework and I had to go to school without homework several times because she had no time to clean my school supplies.

Our flat increasingly started to look like a hoarders flat since I was 10 or 11. In the end there were only very narrow paths to get to the bed, the bathroom and the kitchen. All rooms were full except the bathroom and kitchen. I was not allowed to enter at least 5 rooms. 

But I am not sure if she is a hoarder because the flat looked like this because of these three reasons:

1. Every time she was convinced that something is so dirty that she has to scrub it for a week she put it in a trash bag or box and put it in a corner to clean later when she ""has time"". But she never had time, she never had a job but she found no time. Then she bought the same thing new because she has to clean it much less if it is new from the store. Because of this so much stuff to clean later and the replacement for the stuff piled up.

2. She bought a new cupboard because she wanted to throw out the old one but she never did throw out the old one because no time, so there were two huuuge cupboards in the livingroom for many years. Same with the couch and with several carpets. She also always claims she can't do this and that because she has to do other things first. But she also never does the other things. That would be okay, if she allowed me to do anything but she forbids it. 

3. We have several moldy furniture but she refused to throw it out, because we could remove the mold later. But she never did and I feel like my lungs are damaged after I had to breathe the mold for years because it was where I slept and lived while she slept in a non moldy room.

  
She used to clean so much and our flat was clean when I was 7 years old. But since I was 10 or 11 our flat started to look like a hoarders flat and it only gets worse. The flat is so dirty! The toilet has not been cleaned for YEARS! But she forbids me to clean it!

But when she washes the dishes she takes 5 hours to wash ONE pot! Because she thinks it is not clean otherwise. 

I dont know how she can be so fixated on hygiene that she scrubs the sink for 5 hours, the pot for another 5 hours and so on but she is okay with not cleaning anything else at all. The only things she scrubs all the time is her hands, her face and her sink. She also washes the dishes and does the laundry and takes the trash out. 

But the toilet, the floor, everything else did not get cleaned for years. She does not even shower regularly. It is a contradiction. She also made me drink water out of moldy cups for years because she claimed they are too hard to clean and i was not allowed to clean them.

She ruined my health and is continuing to ruin my health and I don't know how to get out because she keeps all my papers out of my reach and I have no knowledge what to do to get out. CPS will not help me, because the only help children before they are 18. 

She was also extremely scared of AIDS HIV all my life. 

In the last years she traumatized me. I can not tell you how, because the text is already too long. But since then I have horrible intrusive thoughts. I never had intrusive thoughts before.

More than 10 years ago my mom had intrusive thoughts too but they vanished. And now she traumatized me until I got them too.

When I was 11 I was not scared of dirt, illnesses, bacteria and so on yet. I was running around in the meadow and picking flowers and catching insects. She always shouted at me if I picked something up from the floor, for example if my hairclip fell on the sidewalk. 

But after her screaming at me for so many years and telling me everything is dirty and isolating me and not letting me leave our flat for many years I feel different.

Suddenly I am scared to touch grass and other things. Also I just dont know how to clean normally. I know now that how my mom cleans things is wrong but I never learned how to do it differently. 

How am I supposed to clean my own flat if I find a way to move out? I have no one who can teach me how to clean. And i can't afford therapy.",1754590671.0,1,2,OCD,ocd

1mjxthl,Narcissistic Abuse triggering OCD,"Broke up with my narcissistic ex 1 year ago and in that year I started experiencing what I now can identify as OCD (recently diagnosed). My obsession was narcissism. Fears that I was actually the narcissist like my ex claimed. Fears of being a bad person. Compulsively researching and ruminating over the past and trying to make sense of my reality. I could barely work that’s how much this consumed me. I lost entire days to this obsession. I was hardly sleeping and eating. Some days I would be assured that I was the victim, but some days the doubt was so strong. I felt myself splitting back and forth between victim and abuser. It got so bad that one day I woke up fully convinced I was a narcissist and experiencing narcissistic collapse. I had paranoia that everyone around me knew. I fully lost insight and it was the scariest experience ever. It felt like an ego death and like I had no identity. Low dose abilify helped pull me out.

I believe this stemmed from chronic gaslighting over an 8 year relationship and was some sort of a trauma response.

My body has been failing me lately so that doesn't help, and I can't stop replaying that incident in that public restroom, it has only intensified my already existing worries. For the past days, I've been crying on and off, getting ugly thoughts that cutting that limb, how it might somehow make me safe. I wish this torment would end, I feel so ashamed of my struggles because in a way I feel crazy when I'm around people. Diagnosed with OCD at twelve, but I don't remember it ever being this bad, I'm about to be twenty. There was a time when the compulsions quieted down, but now they’ve returned with a vengeance, hitting me like a bat to the head. 

My heart pounds in all my limbs, and I feel crazy. My mind is spiraling, creating vivid documentation of my own demise, I lie awake, my until my mind quits racing for weeks, because I'm worried when a new sensation, new problem appears. Until the feeling that my thoughts become background noise sets in. My perception of life is like seeing through an old digital camera, everything is a blur but the sounds in my head...it's terrifying....how quickly things have spiraled. I find myself rocking back and forth, consumed by the weight of existence as a whole...pondering the strangers I pass...each one carrying their own grief, own life...while we all remain blissfully unaware of one another. I am just a stranger walking by.

I think about how uncertain this world is, how crazy it is that there's no clarity. I hate uncertainty. How did I manage to live this long? How am I expected to live like this? I just want to feel okay. I feel like my own sanity is slipping through me.

I often find myself wondering how anyone could choose to bring a new life into a world so full of uncertainty. This makes me feel guilty, I love my parents. I do want to live I'm glad I am here but this fear is hard. It dawns on me that this disorder has followed me throughout my whole existence. It has always been lurking just beneath the surface, never clear to my eyes, especially since it was never addressed during my younger years. I want help, yet the mere thought of seeking it feels wrong, as if believing in the possibility of my own saving could somehow...hurt me. I don't know.

1mk1y0l,"Not looking for diagnosis, just advice","I don't want to share my age but I will admit I am a female teenager. Around 1-2 years ago, I found out that I want to be a doctor. I enjoyed the aspect of biology and chemistry and helping others out. Everyday I would do research about mental health, physical health, skin conditions, etc. One day, I opened a page about OCD. I read the symptoms and thought 'oh wow, this sort of seems like me'. Not only that, but before all of this, I was already a very anxious person, with incredibly intrusive thoughts. Since the age of 5, I have always had disturbing thoughts like 'a giant bear is behind you, don't move', gradually getting more scarier.

I am a relatively clean person too. Some days I struggle to clean because the environment of my house is too much stress, where as other days, I clean the entire house, even my phone gallery, daily. If something isn't organised or in the right place, my brain just starts panicking and gets annoyed easily. I don't usually wash my hands twice or thrice, I just do it once and thoroughly. I don't like touching dirty surfaces, sitting on the grass or ground, eating food from the floor or anything that has to do with germs/contamination because it grosses me out.

Some of my intrusive thoughts are 'if you ____, you will die', or 'if you reply, you won't go to heaven', and some are a lot more religious than others, but I am too scared to type them here. I doubt myself very often too; sometimes I get thoughts like 'what if this is all a joke? what if you don't even have OCD, what if your just in an endless loop of thoughts?'. These confuse me a lot and I don't even get what my brain is saying. 

My dad hoards A LOT, like a lot, he also checks things over and over again, so I'm not sure if this could also be OCD, have had an impact on me or is genetic. He does not have diagnosed OCD.

I have trouble sleeping and have to cover my face because my brain always thinks that there is a monster or something. Sometimes it gets so bad that I get thoughts like 'stop breathing or you will get sleep paralysis' or whatever. 

I am currently not in a position where I can go to a doctor and get this checked out because my parents are Christian and will say 'just pray, and it will all go'. Of course I also believe in Christ, but I don't think this is the case. It seems very hard to believe and I'm upset too that I can't go to a doctor, so if you have any methods to get rid of these thoughts then please do. The moment I turn 18 I will get this checked out.

1mk06qj,Came back from a vacation and now my whole apartment feels contaminated — what would you do?,"Just got back from a family trip to Greece. We stayed in a familiar apartment complex, but this time we were in a unit we’d never been in before — and it was *rough*. Nothing had been renovated in over a decade.

The bathroom was the worst part: no shower cabin, just a raised tile section with no curtain, water everywhere, and the toilet + brush right next to it. It felt impossible to get clean — more like we were showering *in* filth. I felt gross the entire time.

When I got home, I showered right away — but I *purposely* didn’t clean my shower that night or in the days after. It was kind of an exposure therapy thing, like I was trying to sit with the discomfort and prove to myself that I didn’t *need* to scrub everything immediately. But now that time has passed, the feeling hasn’t gone away — I still feel like I brought the dirt back with me. Even brushing my teeth that first night felt wrong, like I didn’t actually get clean.

Now it feels like my entire apartment is “contaminated.” Not visibly dirty, but like the unclean *feeling* has spread everywhere. To make it worse, both my mom and I got sick (probably heat-related), but it just reinforced the idea that the place was unhygienic enough to affect me even after I left.

I have everything I ever wanted growing up: married, house, good job, pets. But my brain won’t let me enjoy any of it. All of this is really hard to admit on here, I can barely even talk to my spouse and family about it because I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t feel like I have a ton of support, when I told my mom I was looking into therapy she said maybe I just need more vitamins. Therapy is also an extremely long wait in my area. My husband is the only one who’s been supportive of me getting help and gently reminds me that my brain isn’t always kind to me. 

I’m fine while I’m distracted at work but later at home I might ruminate over an interaction over and over again, wondering if I said anything wrong or if my body language expressed anything negative but then I can’t remember EVERY detail and panic that I’m missing something I could have said that could have caused it to be a negative interaction. The other person never expresses that it was but I worry they’re just being nice and maybe all of my coworkers secretly hate me. 

When driving, I know I’m watching the road but I’ll hit a bump or maybe a rock hits my car or something and I wonder if I hit someone without realizing it so I’ll glance in the rear view mirror, then worry I hit someone while I was checking the mirror. I’ve turned back before just to check that no one was there. If an ambulance drives by going the opposite direction I worry that they’re heading to the scene because I hit someone and didn’t know it. If I’m not even in the car and hear sirens I worry if I hit someone or caused an accident on the way to my destination even if that was an hour ago. I’ve never been in a car accident in my life and I’ve been driving for 13 years. 

I feel like my memory is getting worse over time because I can’t remember every detail of every minute of my day. Then I panic that something is causing memory loss and will spend hours on Google searching about memory issues and fatigue. This usually happens around the time I need to go bed and I’ll end up getting only 3-4 hours of sleep because I’m convinced something is wrong with me. 

I try to find distractions and as long as I’m busy at work, can get into a tv show, read, or clean then I’m okay. But doing those things in the first place instead of focusing on another issue or as soon as I’m done with those tasks, it’s back to ruminating.

I've had a massive fear of someone walking in on me in the bathroom or while changing; getting undressed entirely was terrifying. I would constantly check locks, hide in my closet, change clothes in a specific order so I always had something on me, and I'd even turn stuffed animals in my room to face away from me. It took me forever to make an actual habit of showering.

As I got older and started working through therapy I realized how irrational my compulsions were and tried to avoid them, but then I'd worry that the one time I didn't check the locks would be the one time my fears actually came true.

And then tonight just happened. I finished watching a movie with my family, went to my room to change, and only realized once I'd taken my pants off that I hadn't closed my door all the way. Ofc I had that sudden moment of panic, but once I slipped my pants on and shut the door I just kinda chuckled to myself.

1mjw8sa,Having trouble with hyperfixations turning unhealthy,"Anyone else’s hyperfixations turn unhealthy? Tw for brief mention of sh below

For context I have bipolar 1 as well, and my psychiatrist thinks autism too but I haven’t gotten a diagnosis yet. I’ve had hyperfixations all my life, some lasting weeks and others lasting months or even years. I was diagnosed with OCD at 15 (I’m 18 now) I’m getting deep into another manic episode pretty quickly (it seems this tends to be a pattern with me) where all I can think about is my fixation and it consumes my life completely. 

I hardly sleep now and either forget to do things like shower or eat or just straight up ignore them in favor of consuming content related to my fixation. Even if I don’t have the internet or anything I can’t stop thinking about it and it even makes its way into my dreams. 

When I’m manic my resting heart rate goes up a noticeable amount and I am in constant cold sweats and have headaches with random bursts of energy and confidence. I’ve literally been sweating non-stop for the past 4 days now. 

In the past the only way I’ve been able to cope with mania was self harm and it became an addiction that spiraled pretty fast and right now I’m trying my best not to relapse into it. 

I just need some support right now honestly, this cycle I’m stuck in feels very tiring.",1754561773.0,1,1,OCD,ocd

I’ve been dealing with contamination OCD, and it’s been overwhelming. I’m actually having my first therapy session today, and I’m really excited about it. I’d really like to also have people I can talk to and relate to along the way.

I’m a female, but I don’t care about gender I just want to connect with others who get it. If anyone’s open to chatting, venting, or even becoming friends, I’d really appreciate it.

I’m not sure if this kind of post is allowed here, but I figured I’d give it a shot.

many obsessions and compulsions being formed and deeply integrated with my PTSD. In other words the fears and obsessions are rooted in reality and hypervilligance. On top of that is the autism which just makes everything more difficult and me unable to achieve the goals I set out to achieve, yet tried to do everything perfectly for. It’s a mess

1mjq888,Always being right when making catastrophic predictions,"Hi, my name is Andi. I am 34 years old and I am on the autism spectrum. In addition to autism I also have ADHD and of course OCD, mainly due to my complex-PTSD.

Ever since I was really young, I believe that I was cursed to have perpetual bad luck. This was as a result of severe physical abuse at home as well as as severe bullying in public school and the fact I had no friends, and my belief was that I was so unlucky and so cursed that I had something called reverse Karma that when I would do something good for someone instead of something good happening something bad would happen and when someone does something bad to me such as abuse me or bullying me the bad thing that’s meant to happen to them and returned what happened to me instead. 

And I believed that there was no end into this and so I decided to do some made up rituals that I believed would “break the curse.” 

Even though I was believing in such nonsense, it was the only logical thing I could believe based on how bad my situation was. 

Literally every catastrophic thing that I predicted would come true with 100% accuracy. 

And if I did my rituals that I believed would break the bad luck cars the bad things I was worried about would not happen and the more rituals I did the better things got for me. 

However, just as I was worried about the rituals, lost their muster and I realize I had to do more and more and more to feel satisfied, that I did enough to break the curse, or at least hold it at bay. 

This was when I was a teenager. I am now 34 years old. I’m about to get my bachelors degree in broadcasting. 

One of my catastrophic predictions that unfortunately did come true and is still happening in the present is that I am never going to be in a relationship and to prevent that outcome from happening I went on as many dating sites as I could find and would spend all my time on dating sites, including Facebook dating, and many autism datinggroups. I would get into frequent arguments with the others there that these dating groups and dating sites are a waste of time and that no one will ever date me and just as I predicted that’s exactly what happened. 

As soon as a girl that I have feelings for find out that I am autistic, she would immediately reject me and not even give me a chance. To prove my point and prove the others wrong who don’t think I’m being rejected for my autism. I did an experiment.

For a while, I did not put that I was autistic on my dating profile which they recommended I should. They said I should put on my dating profile that I am autistic as not putting that might make it harder for me to find the right person.

As part of the experiment for several months, I did not put on my profile description that I was on the spectrum, and as I expected all the girls that I matched with reply to me when I messaged them first. 

But then I made a prediction to my friends, a.k.a. the group home staff that when I do put my autism diagnosis, every single girl that I match with will either not reply to me or blocked me immediately. 

And I put my diagnosis somewhere at the bottom of my description, so it would be the last thing they read, as I did not want to make it a major part of myself and that it’s something that that is part of me, but not so major. 

As expected all the girls that I started getting matched with, did not reply to me and or unmatched me a.k.a. blocked me. 

I even predicted that girls who wrote on their profile that they were autistic would also not reply to me and or block me and I said that to the group home staff and just as I said, I was right as well I matched with at least 20 to 30 autistic women who were my age and all of them besides one did not reply to me and ignored me. 

And you know what their answer was even though I did everything right they said it’s because I’m putting so much negative energy into the universe. 

And I argued it’s because I’m not doing my rituals and because society hates people who are different. 

Maybe I’m taking this magical thinking thing a little too far but when I was doing my rituals years ago much more than I’m doing them now I had much better luck. 

So far in my life, I can’t say I’ve been single my whole life as I’ve been in two brief relationships, both in the last two years, but cumulatively only six months for both of them combined. 

And none of the break ups were my fault, but entirely due to circumstances outside of both our controls. And because the relationships ended on good terms, I am friends with both my exes.

1mjttt7,"my psychiatrist doesn’t believe I have trichotillomania, but I’ve been pulling my hair out for seven years.","so I (22F) have been pulling out my hair since I was 15. it started (and still mainly manifests) as pulling apart my split ends and quickly became a common practice anytime I was bored, anxious, or emotional. while I don't yank my hair from my scalp per se, I do remove a LOT of hair, both partway down at split ends and at the root. it gets especially bad when I am trying to do work or am scrolling on social media for more than like two minutes.
I really don't know how to gauge how long I spend doing this each day- I told my psychiatrist it was 30-60 minutes but it's such a constant part of my life now that I think it's actually much longer. it also severely affects my shower routine as I constantly rake my hands through my hair and collect all of the strands to throw away, I didn't think that part was a problem until I was in a situation where I couldn't do this in my certain way and I became very anxious and even more obsessive about it.

in the past few years but especially the past few months, my hair has very noticeably thinned. I warn
hairdressers about my hair pulling and they can tell right away. I have sections of hair that have extremely damaged and shortened ends compared to the others, and my hair has thinned to the same as my mom going through menopause and autoimmune disorders. the amount of hair that comes out each day feels extremely alarming to me, but my psychiatrist still refers to it as ""that little thing where I mess with my hair."" she says that it doesn't count as trichotillomania because I'm not yanking my hair directly from the root (my roommate who is diagnosed does it this way).

I truly think I downplayed the situation too much when I started working with this psychiatrist, and she's not a specialist with OCD. she's more of a blending western and functional medicine kind of
practitioner, courtesy of my mom who is super into alternative medicine. which is great and all, there's a lot of benefit to that. I like the other things I'm working on with my psychiatrist such as gut health, but feel so so frustrated that she doesn't

recognize the severity of my hair pulling. I've tried to talk to her about this and she's told me how it's all connected to my OCD and once we treat that more, it'll naturally get better. and yes, I do think my hair pulling is part of my OCD, but it also feels like something more. it feels so much more out of control than other OCD things I'm working on and I'm scared I'll start getting bald patches.

what is the best way to approach this conversation again with my
psychiatrist? part of me wants to take pictures of the massive piles of hair I pull out or track how long I actually spend pulling it out to prove it to her, but I have this gut feeling that those wouldn't be helpful for me and could even become compulsions. should I explain the diagnostic criteria for trichotillomania and explain how I believe I fall within those criteria? I don't necessarily
*need* a diagnosis or the label, I just want to be taken seriously and work on this issue more. should I switch psychiatrists altogether?

I already avoid leaving the house more than necessary because being outside feels too revealing.

1mjqtqa,"Magical Thinking, Health Anxiety & Chronic Illness - Please share your tips/experiences/help/ideas","
Hi! So I have been scouring the in the rnet the last couple weeks and have not found anything helpful for my specific case - so I am hoping that maybe here someone has a tip or some helpful words for me. So sorry for the long read, thanks to everyone who takes the time! 🫂

Essentially, I am severely chronically ill (ME/CFS, bedridden) and I think I have a very strong case of Magical Thinking, combined with Health Anxiety. Unfortunately because I also actually am very ill, I can‘t seem to find a way out. 

It‘s sort of 2 OCD problems that come together: 

1: Health Anxiety, mostly Food. I can only eat one meal, because I am so scared I will have an allergic reaction. At first I just kept leaving foods away because my symptoms worsened and I thought „Maybe this food was responsible that my fatigue was even worse, I will leave that away from now on!“ Gradually, more and more foods went away. Then it turned into an extreme fear of a strong allergic reaction. At first I couldnt eat foods anymore that were known for a typical allergy, like Nuts, certain Fruits etc. Then anytime I hadn‘t eaten a food for a couple days, I thought „What if now I am allergic? Allergies can develop at anytime, any age, any food. I can‘t risk it.“ The problem is, that even though I know its very unlikely that I suddenly develop an allergy as adult, the small chance of it is scary enough that I can‘t eat it. Because lets say I do have one, and I need to go to the hospital - this whole situation would cause such intense over extertion, that its very possible that I would be in a even worse situation with my health, like can‘t even sit up anymore bad - with no chance of improving again, and that is so insanely scary that I can‘t seem to follow through with exposure therapy protocols I have found online. But also I have only one meal left I can eat, (Rice, Chicken, Broccoli, Currysauce, Dates, Bananas), and what if I can‘t eat those anymore either suddenly? What then? It worries me. 

2 - The second is Magical Thinking. There has been a lifetime of health issues for me, in younger years more mental with anxiety and adhd, from 12+ also very physically. I have noticed a very clear pattern over my life, that whenever I feel good, or safe, and trust that it will stay that way or that my health and with it my life wont be taken from me, exactly that happens. And not just when its good, its specifically when I trust it. Like when I used to have an event I was excited for, if I was worrying if I was gonna be sick, I was rarely to never sick and I could go. If I would not worry, and believe that it was going to be fine and just be excited, with almost 100% certainty I would be sick or something else would happen that would prevent me going to the event and having a good time.

 This is on the small scale, but its happend on way way bigger scales. like when I a couple years ago for the first time in my life could work and go out with friends and just FINALLY have a normal life - I couldnt trust in it for months because it always got taken away from me. After almost a year I had full trust that my health had made a turn around and that even though there are regular up and downs in life, I will get to keep a normalcy in life and wont have everything taken from me. Well, literally weeks after I realized and said out loud to my mom that I was not fearing it at all anymore and trusting it, it started going bad and over the course of the next two years it continiously worsened to the point where I am at now - fully out of society, ill to the point of having 0 contact with friends, not being able to leave the bed, no job, no nothing. Everything is gone once again. No matter what I tried to stop that downwoards spiral it was unstoppable.
 Its truly so continiously happend like that throughout my life that I just cannot believe anymore that its all just happening by chance or that I am just putting more focus on the good than the bad. There are SO many examples of this, smaller and bigger ones. 

Now I feel like as soon as I trust or hope it will get better, I will get worse. I have convinced myself that the universe wants to keep me in my place, and that any attempt of getting better or believing it will get better and I will have a life again, or even just hoping - will lead to the universe punishing me by making my situation even more horrible, to show me that I am not in control and have no say and should accept my suffering. If I don‘t hope and don‘t try to get better, my situation stays mostly the same. Its obviously still horrible, but it can always be worse. So I am so terrified to do anything out of fear of having to suffer even more. The problem with that is that if I google those thoughts I on one hand find magical thinking OCD,  but on the other hand I find a lot of spiritual things that says I need to open myself spiritually to the universe and stuff like that or for me personally even crazier stuff about actual magic that is on me.

 I don’t personally believe in that but also the fear around my situation trumps all of my rational beliefs. Other stuff says a lot about retraining the brain or the law of attraction or rewiring your nervous system. Unfortunately, I am at the point with my fear that I feel like I cannot try out anything that could possibly help because the universe will see me trying to get better and punish me for it. I also for example can’t even say out loud anymore or write down things that are currently good. Like if I had a good day in terms of one symptom I cannot say it or even think it because as soon as I consciously acknowledge something good, the universe will see that they have not taken that yet and immediately take it, and that symptom will get much worse from then on. 
 That belief is so intense and strong that I feel like I can’t even get help from my therapist for the OCD magical thinking because even that would be seen as trying to get better by the universe. 

I feel like I am completely stuck. I don’t want to believe those things about the universe but I feel like I have so much evidence that it’s true that it has turned into a very deep belief not just a fear, a true true belief. I don’t know where to go from here. It is such a specific situation with my health because there are very serious and real consequences at stake that I can’t just play around with and see what happens. Because if it does happen what I fear it will, the consequences are so catastrophic for me and making an already unbearable situation even more unbearable, to the point where I just don‘t see how I could risk anything ever again.

I got diagnosed with OCD this week. In some ways it’s a relief. I’d been considering OCD for a few years now but refused to talk about it with anyone because I was afraid I was faking it or that I’d make it worse somehow by talking about it 🙃.

My therapy has always focused on my C/PTSD, but over the weekend I realized how intertwined the OCD is with all my trauma! Which is what finally encouraged me to talk to my therapist about it and get the official diagnosis. 

Since then, I’ve gone through the relief and then the immediate self-doubt “I’m faking it” then back to being overwhelmed by the thoughts, then back to relief when I name it and am able to give myself even a few minutes of silence in my brain.

I’m wondering how common it is for OCD diagnoses to happen after childhood SA experiences (like myself). My therapist told me that trauma can be a catalyst for OCD, and I do think a lot of my symptoms can be traced back to those childhood years as well! 

I’m grateful to have found spaces like this online for people with similar struggles! Thank yall for being so transparent. It’s good to know I’m not alone.

1mjo9d3,"ERP works for some of my OCD, but not all of it. Any advice?","Hi all. For context, I am in my early 20s and have struggled with OCD since I was pretty little, but I only got a diagnosis a few years ago and only started OCD-specific therapy this year.

My OCD functions in two modes: intrusive thoughts and intrusive memories. My intrusive thoughts revolve around themes like contamination, harm, moral scrupulosity, and other nasty stuff. For example, if I eat something that tastes a little weird, I might have the intrusive thought that it's been poisoned or that it's gone bad and I'll get sick from eating it. These types of hypothetical intrusive thoughts can be managed decently well with ERP. I just got back from a trip to NYC which was very challenging to many of my themes, but I used it as an opportunity to exercise some ERP skills. These themes are annoying, but I can live with them.

My intrusive memories are mostly moral scrupulosity related. Dozens of times a day, I get intrusive memories/flashbacks to times I have said or done things (usually by accident or out of ignorance) that do not align with my moral values. For example, I still get flashbacks to a time I accidentally used the word ""fat"" as an insult in front of one of my friends who is fat several years ago. Sometimes they're triggered by something, but often they are completely random. The compulsions that come with these memories are to verbally berate myself. I feel immense shame and embarrassment from these memories.

I have tried to follow what my therapist has told me about sitting with my memories and feeling the shame without doing my compulsions, but it just makes me feel awful and hasn't had seemingly any effect on how much they rule my fucking life. Maybe I'm just not working hard enough, but I feel like I am making progress in other places, so I don't know.

Has anyone had any experiences similar to this? If so, have you had luck with any specific treatments or therapies, including ERP? I am curious if IFS/partswork therapy might be beneficial for me.",1754533877.0,1,1,OCD,ocd

Hi guys!

I hung out with a friend of mine yesterday who knows I’ve been in the middle of a really bad death/health OCD episode. I isolate myself as a coping mechanism and somehow managed to pluck up the courage to socialise!

Unfortunately, she said something which really triggered and hurt me. She’s going overseas for work for about 6 months and she said she was worried about me because ‘what if you died’.

I genuinely had no idea how to respond. I think I started to tear up and asked her why she would say that? 

I have chronic health concerns and severe health anxiety as well as death OCD. Her statement has wrecked me mentally. The worst part is that it wasn’t even said as a joke, she meant it seriously. 

She listened to me when I vented a little later on during our hang out but… I went home feeling like crap. I’ve never really been through something like this before and I suppose I wanted to see how others may cope with something like this, as I’m finding it very hard!

Until recently, I was juggling a high-stress job with inconsistent hours and full-time online classes. Now that I’m unemployed, I expected things to get easier but they’ve gotten worse.

I constantly spiral between two thoughts:
	• ""You’ve watched this video 5 times and still can’t focus. You aren't retaining anything.""
	• "" You don't have time for this. There isn't time as it is. You aren't going to finish and you are going to fail.""

A friend invites me to brunch at noon. I tell myself I’ll start getting ready at 9, do a bit of schoolwork before, then head out. But in reality, I spend the entire morning getting ready, get home later than planned, and the assignments I am doing are taking so much longer than I thought they would.

The cycle repeats. Now, ""if I go do x thing, I won't have time to do anything else"". To the point where I cancel everything last minute and don't go anywhere more than 10 minutes away. I start a new job last week and I'm terrified because I'm already struggling now.

It was pretty heavy uhhhh in the 2010s. And then it disappeared completely (not like it tapered off. It was terrible, my bedtime ritual lasted 10 minutes and I did a minute long ritual every other minute. It just stopped one day like someone hit pause on it, and I didn't pay any mind and I was normal ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯). And then it came back with a vengeance in 2020 or something, starting slowly like an imaginary frog in boiling water. And I went through mental health treatment for other stuff that also touched on OCD. And it got better. And then on my own I bullied myself into denying the beast (touching things I thought were contaminated, doing things exactly the unlucky number amount). And so I'd say I'm pretty stable rn as long as I don't indulge in compulsions too much and do at least one rebel per day.

But at the very start before the first wave, I remember lying in bed, thinking ""I need a number. An unlucky number, and a lucky number."" And I went through a few numbers before landing on 3 as the unlucky one, and 7 as the lucky one. (And 9 for the apologizing to the Greater Being one. This one stayed disappeared when everything blipped away. So I did something 7ly after I did something 3ishly, and then I did something 9ly when I messed up and I felt like I was doing something wrong. Yk I forgot I had an apology number.) I wasn't necessarily distressed about this, I thought I was discovering a way to control reality (and also apologize to the Greater Being DAMN I forgot I had this guy. What the hell was that lol? It's popped up once or twice in week-long or day-long monents full of stress, but now that I don't feel it, it's like someone else felt it and I'm just watching their memories like the people watching the Truman show).

In 2023 I was put on meds (SSRI, fluoxesomething. I peed like a horse and my dreams were weird, dunno if they did anything to the thoughts) specifically for the OCD after yammering to the psychiatrist about it, but I don't remember being diagnosed with OCD at all (and I'm not checking records because I didn't speak to the psychiatrist for longer than 10 minutes, it's be weird if I got diagnosed in that short time). I just spoke about compulsions and obsessions and she accepted it. So maybe I have 'simulated OCD', if that even exists.  

So: what if I brought this on myself? I'm not feeling any stress about that, I think. Shit happens. I was like 15.  But if I did, maybe I need to change ""I have OCD"" to ""I have simulated OCD."" But that doesn't feel quite right either. If I tried really hard to think ""I'm just simulating this. This is a choice"", I can't break out of it. It feels real. Or it feels close to real enough that I won't take that chance. So maybe it's not a choice right now, but maybe it *was* a choice back then, when I was thinking of the numbers??

Talking about numbers so much makes it seem like they're my most common theme. They were big in the 2010s, and when it came back after the blip they were also there, but the harm OCD and the pOCD were worse. Since then, the numbers thing has reduced to where I'm somewhat fine writing it and looking at it 3 3 3, and the hOCD doesn't entirely control me, and the pOCD is gone (#yippee!). 

Where I'm at, healthcare is free. But they're all underpaid af so their care is bare minimum, which is good if you have some easy stuff like a broken arm but terrible if your problem requires some trial and error. I think I could have someone help me parse through my thoughts if I paid for private care but it's not that vital. Yet. I also feel like that would be rocking the boat? So not today, not soon. I'll go if my thinking about it being simulated got too serious (I doubt that'll ever happen but anything's possible), or if the Greater Being stuff comes back *and* lasts for longer than a week or is excessively affecting my errands n stuff  (an alien concept to me rn, but then I start feeling it's presence, so).

I honestly was in shock as they told me this and felt so devalued. I have struggled so much for so long and to even get to the point where I opened up and asked for help was a big step for me and to hear that “everyone has OCD traits” was not only unhelpful but very dismissive.
Does anyone know where to go from here? I’m honestly at a loss. They said if it’s very severe I MAY be able to get some help moving forward but it’s not guaranteed.

I worry the people who saw me will pass by me again one day somewhere, and recongize me and remember what happened. I'm scared about being judged and made fun of by strangers. I'm scared of people. I panic and feel sick. I literally can't sleep because I'm replaying the event in my mind. I can't let go. It never leaves me EVER. It feels like a cringe ""attack"". Its so painful

I don't know what to do. I feel like my existence is ""tainted"" by every mistake or embarassment, small or big",1754500725.0,2,0,OCD,ocd
1mjfv4v,Unwarranted Over thinking Ruins Everything,"Likely a combination of OCD and my other mental illnesses, I can't enjoy little things without over thinking the aftermath, and thus burdened with discomfort.

For example, I envy people who can contently complete color by numbers, and coloring pages guilt free, not having to think about what they'll do with the page when they're done. 

My brain struggles to put aside the future and ignore the inevitable consequences of my choices, seeing both good and bad ones, but fixating on the upsetting ones. 

In the case of coloring sheets and color by number, I'll start one, or be thinking about starting one, only to be forced to contemplate what I'm doing with it. This causes me feelings of unworthiness and wastefulness, when I conclude that I will end up just throwing it away.  ",1754512422.0,1,0,OCD,ocd

Long story short before it startes I was dealing with dissonance due a to a romantic relationship and before that I was dealing with paranoia that everyone hated me. Thus lasted about two months. In the third month I started having intrusive thoughts and what I think is that everything was causing me to start dissociating.

I had inteusive thoughts about who I am and my identity, like existencial ocd. Mostrly about what makes me and what people make me ""me"" and who I am.

I started to not tecognize myself.

Also was going trough several stress, it started to manifest physically.

I started to obsessively checking my emotional connection to everything, specially what I liked. It felt like something in my brain wanted to self destruct or destroy who I am or freezing whenerver I thought of something I liked.

It was starting to be too much and I felt disconnected from many things.

And then something else happened that I started feeling this pain on the left temple, I felt like I was shot in the head.

Started having severe dpdr episodes and now I am trying to dp my best to get better, I feel like this ""pain"" or tension started advancing and taking more space, I started having weird dresms and I feel sveerally different to how I used to feel before this.

1mje12k,When therapy becomes toxic to someone with OCD.,"I have had all sorts of OCD in my life... ever since I was a kid, and have been through therapy for it. I have had multiple different themes and styles. I don't know what comes first, an obsessive personality that causes OCD to form... or OCD which enforces a more obsessive personality, but either way.... I have both. Which got me thinking....

When does therapy become toxic to me because of my obsessive personality? Has anyone else had this thought or this experience? For example.... right now, I am in therapy for something other than OCD; it's more trauma in regards to my parents. But here is the thing.... I'm starting to realize that yes, I have parental trauma... but I am also a bit obsessive about my trauma due to my natural inclination to this obsessive behavior. Due to my obsession with my trauma, my compulsion is to seek reassurance and validation/and understanding. Like... I will go on Reddit and type in a million different questions about my parental trauma, trying to understand it, validate it, and see if others have the same problems or experienced the same thing. etc. its past the point of processing. When i get really anxious about my feelings about my parents... I will become obsessed with seeking reassurance and validation. I even think part of reaching out for therapy was for reassurance. Here's the thing, though... some reassurance is fine... i think it comes with processing.... but when does therapy exacerbate the issues of obsession? 

Like sometimes, I think it would be better for me because of my obsessive nature... to stop talking about it so much. Stop trying to get people to validate or reassure me.... including the therapist. Talking about my issues so much is just making my obsession with my trauma worse. i notice more things, I get more anxious, seeking reassurance makes me think about it more....etc.   
  
Would if I treated it more like acceptance in OCD treatment. Yes, the trauma sucks, but you need to accept that it happened and do what you need to do to make it better, then move on. Stop talking about it so much, stop giving room in your brain for it, stop trying to get people to tell you that YES that's abuse... Stop trying to get your therapist to tell you that you have a right to feel the way you feel, stop trying to understand your parents' actions or behaviors, stop trying to get your husband to tell you that what your mom did was bad....etc. Just accept you are uncomfortable, don't Google, don't talk to people about it.... and find healthy ways to get through it. 

Does anyone else find that seeking reassurance is a horrible, obsessive coping mechanism that therapy sometimes enforces? Do you feel like maybe... some of your problems that aren't OCD related... are more of a problem because of your overall obsessive personality? This is just a thought. I would love to have some discussions on this....  you can agree or disagree... its just something ive been thinking through. Does your OCD give you a more natural proclivity to obsessive behaviors in general... and how do you feel it affects you?

1mjc029,Newly diagnosed,"32, newly diagnosed. Have realized I’ve been struggling with this my entire life and have had no idea. Most of my obsessions/compulsions are mental. 

I’m not looking for reassurance, I’m just sort of trying to put the pieces together here. 

Looking back, I have clear patterns of times when I’ve been in genuinely “good” places in life - typically when my social life is booming (and I’m coping with a lot of alcohol/marijuana). Less time in my head. More time around others. Self medicating at times. However, these “cycles” tend to end in me becoming paranoid about being talked about, values changing, becoming ridiculously aware of things that may bother me about the other person or people, and essentially cutting and running. This then leads to a very long stint of depression, isolation, rumination - basically crawling into a hole. Climb out of the pit, reconnect socially very slowly because I realize that’s part of why I’m so depressed… Then repeat. 

Yes I’ve been in therapy, yes I’ve had extensive trauma treatments, yes I’m medicated.

I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this kind of cycle in life possibly due to obsessions/compulsions. I’m trying to determine if it’s possible this is some form of “just right”-ing, etc. 

Hopefully someone can relate with this and provide support or guidance on how you’ve been able to manage! I get very confused about what’s intrusive and what’s actually a valid concern, tbh.

Thank you!

1miyc4z,Ocd ruins my fav Media and creativity,"I'm pretty sure I have a niche problem here and I'm also pretty sure ocd is involved as well as autism. For the past few years I am Crazy passionate about fictional characters to the point of pairing them up with characters I completely made up in my head or imagining scenarios outside of canon for them. However things have went completely downhill since 2017. In that year I had a massive crush on an indie game character to the point of obsessively fantasizing about me and them. This was completely fine for a long time, I was happy, but then came tomodachi life, I put me and him in the game and they got happily married, but then after a long time the me in game wanted a divorce. She gave him a second chance but then I made a decision I didn't want to have to do to save the relesionship, having a baby. Ever since I let that happen, I no longer liked the character, In fact I still feel stress anytime I see him, as if the situation was real, when it wasn't. Next up 2022, I got invested in a dark manga series and grew really attached to the tragic main character. One night I thought about this cop character I made up and how she would be good to him and boom, ship. I wrote a couple chapters of a fanfic about them and thought about making the cop girl famous for this, but then I thought about the hate. How I would get called out for straight-washing a character. Even though they are literally bi/pan in the manga, and ever since that single thought. The ship died, I no longer loved them, they didn't make my heart melt, and the tragic character brings stress whenever I see him. The stress is worse whenever I think of him with my cop girl. Now in 2025 I have a new oc x cc pair, and I'm scared I'm going to ruin these new characters by simply thinking about them too much. I could just feel it, everytime I obsess over a character or a pair which involves something made up by me it gets ruined, and its all mental illnesses and anxietys fault. I'm trying to replace any thought of the new characters I made with lookalikes on the net, thoughts of this new game character I'm invested in has to be interacting with someone canon to their universe or someone else's oc.

1. if im holding a knife or something the thought of “what if you blackout and hurt your family?” pops in my mind and i panic. 

2. my family members own guns and the thought will pop in my head sometimes of “what if you blackout and shoot your self or someone?”

3. i have severe health anxiety and panic over every little symptom i feel especially new symptoms and will stay awake for days until im certain that im okay.

4. “if i can walk this far within a certain amount of time then me and my family will live long lives”

5. afraid to drink alcohol due to the fear of blacking out or getting possessed and hurting myself or others.

6. double checking several times if doors are locked even tho i know they are.

7. throwing clothes in the dryer/washing machine and having to take the clothes out one by one everytime to make sure my cat isn’t in there even tho i know she’s not but the image of her dying in that gruesome way playing in my head and makes me panic.

Try to remember that time you put in effort to complete some project. School project. Hobby. Chore. Remember the feeling of toil, but confidence. Hardship along the way perhaps.

Think of what purpose there could be in your life to put in a lot of effort for — such as helping people in need. If you have a goal like that, you can put in hard work every day.

Now approach OCD like this. At the start of the day, think about your purpose. To improve even slightly. To do the things you want to do while defeating compulsions. To do meaningful work. To work hard. Determination. Determination. Determination.

I have severe metaphysical contamination, but I am also very much into spirituality and believe that unseen energies/beings exist.

1miweuf,Everything feels like 10x the struggle.,"Every action, no matter how simple, repeated over and over until i can complete it without thinking “bad” thoughts. When my OCD first started it was mostly physical compulsions and rituals , like specific routines i had adjusting objects/positioning them a certain way. This was awful in its own right and limited my life extensively, because i had to follow a very rigid routine and be home by a certain time everyday in order to complete my “rounds” lol.

Now that my issues are almost entirely mental, they feel way more pervasive. The
compulsion can latch itself onto any action i feel i didn’t do right. I can sit and stare at nothing for hours forcing myself to think certain mantras, over and over, to beat away the bad and evil thoughts. The thoughts never stop and I can never stop doing things as long as i’m a human being with a life, so the compulsions never stop either lol. 

I spend a lot of time wondering what my life would be like, if a simple action like picking up my toothbrush and putting it in the cabinet didn’t need to be repeated indefinitely until i felt good about it.

I guess I’m just wondering how many other people share this same flavor of nonspecific but very very pervasive OCD

Little by little, with therapy I stopped doing it for basically a month, then on vacation I relapsed and started again (exactly on July 19th). Since then my brain has been telling me that if I don't vomit SPECIFICALLY twice something bad will happen to me, I don't understand why it wasn't like this before.

also on Saturday 2nd August I went to the disco and drank stupidly (under lithium) and ACCORDING TO MY FRIEND I vomited 6 times, so according to the ""rule of 2"" I should have stayed WITHOUT vomiting until yesterday, so as to ""repair"" everything.

However, I was drunk, I personally don't remember how many times I vomited, I simply relied on a friend who maybe didn't even pay too much attention and I'm tormented by the idea that she told me the wrong number... what if it had been 4? 5? maybe 7 or 8? I don't know.

I’ve been on 10mg Lexapro now for 10 weeks and recently realized it’s been about 2 weeks since I’ve woken up with heart palpitations due to anxiety. I used to wake up and IMMEDIATELY start ruminating. It was like an automatic instinct by brain went to. Now in order to ruminate I have to actively TRY to think of the anxiety provoking thought. And even when I do it doesn’t elicit even close to the same physical symptoms of anxiety as before. 

I will say I feel rather anhedonic though…. Like I kind of don’t care about anything? But right now I will take that over caring so much I cannot function.

I have severe ROCD and recently met someone and things are going well. The thoughts still pop up but instead of obsessing and freaking out I can talk myself down. Like instead of hyperfixating on his physical features i can just say “ok so what? Maybe he’s not the one but you don’t need to know that right now” and then I move on…… it’s actually insane!!

1mind7o,I often worry about the past,"I've just found this subreddit. I have realised there are many different types of OCD and ways it affects people. 

My struggles are commonly about the past, things that might have happened but haven't. For example, Oh, I took a drive today, ""What if you ran someone over without noticing it?"" Then that thought is stuck in my head, sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. I usually look at local news to get clarity, but that's when the thought ""What if they just haven't discovered it yet?"" comes. My mind goes into this insane thought pattern where I'm a horrible person, and I begin to believe my thoughts are facts.

Often, when I'm driving, I'll drive back just to get clarity. But sometimes it's just too far to do that, and I know the thought is more than likely just in my head. It didn't happen. I don't lose focus when driving, and I've been trying to tell myself ""Believe in your past self"" but sometimes that just doesn't help.

Sometimes it's less serious thoughts, such as ""What if I accidentally ran a red light?"" or ""What if I drove too fast?"". 

To subdue these thoughts, I try to search for clarity, but often, the search for clarity just makes me dig even deeper into these thoughts, which makes it harder to let them go. **I have a severe fear of actually causing anyone harm**. It often feels like my brain is looking for reasons to worry about that specifically.

It's not only when I'm driving, but that is a common one and happens almost every single time I drive a vehicle.

1mijb9p,i need help dealing with thoughts about karma,"i want to preface this by saying i have not been diagnosed with OCD. however, based on what i’ve been told by others and what i’ve read, i think i may have some tendencies that are similar to what some people with OCD may have, which is why i’ve come here for help. 

lately i’ve been having a really really hard time with the thought of karma. it feels like whenever i do something bad, it will lead to something bad happening. now logically, if i did something good, that would lead to something good happening, but in my mind it doesn’t actually count, because my mind is convinced that i only did it to receive good karma points. this means that in reality it’s actually more bad karma points that will lead to something bad.
logically, i don’t believe karma is real and i know all of this is silly, but i also can’t convince my mind of that. it feels like karma is in the back of my mind constantly. even if i think something as simple as, oh this person is a very slow driver, my mind immediately goes into ""oh no, bad karma points, you’re a bad person, something bad will happen"".

there are other tendencies as well, such as needing to double check things a lot and counting words, but those have been going on for a while, and while they are frustrating i can manage. this karma thing is new, and it’s led to me having a really hard time being alone / sleeping. when i’m in bed, i’m all alone and i feel like my thoughts just spiral out of control. 

it’s become very frustrating, and i was wondering if anyone else has had this happen and if there’s anything that helped.

I still have intrusive thoughts and the need to jump into action to calm down these thoughts but I believe I have a good control on it, better than 5 years ago.


So context to my question. Ever since I was 12, I was consulting social workers, psychologists, and family doctor. Recently, I got a psychiatrist. And tbh, I am tired of these appointments. I want to stop it all. It’s basically half my life. The appointments, the sessions, the medication. I want to “relax”. Give myself a break, a pat on the back.


But every time I think of it, I tell myself… what if I come back to the way I was? If I leave my psychiatrist and all these treatments, will I get worse? I seriously wonder if a person who has OCD can go on without a psychiatrist. Without social workers. And then I get scared, and this scare just proves to me that I am in fact, not ready to leave… but I still want answers. A little bit of hope.

My OCD is mostly centered around food, I have a deadly peanut allergy and since discovering it have been terrified of basically eating most things. It affects my everyday life and even tho I have my rituals and rules that I follow (sorry if thats not the right terminology this diagnosis is recent and I’m still figuring it out) i have panic attacks most days, fluctuating with my manic depression but never going away, just getting much worse when I’m going through a particularly depressive episode. 

I’m terrified of trying new foods, eating anything made in anyone else’s kitchen, for some reason restaurants are fine but if the serve peanuts in anything other than desert i wont eat there, peanuts in dessert I ask for my food in a plastic to go container. I can’t take the first bag of chips i touch, same with canned drinks. Im terrified of every surface having peanuts on it, a guy who was helping me i saw eat a recess peanut butter cup touched my phone and it freaked me out so bad.

My fear of medication is also centered around my fear of having an allergic reaction. I have TMJ which doesn’t help and im constantly feeling my neck and throat and it feels like my throat is swelling all the time sometimes and i cant stop panicking.

1miql0e,What’s wrong with delaying leisure activities until I get inevitable interruptions out of the way?,"(precautionary NSFW - mentions legal substance use)

I’ve been told that this can be a manifestation of OCD, but it seems entirely logical to me.

I don’t think anyone likes being interrupted when they’re trying to enjoy leisure activities, but apparently I care too much about getting interruptions out of the way.

I seek refuge in escapist leisure activities like playing video games, watching movies, and watching sports. I also partake in legal substances to enhance these experiences, which I don’t like to “waste” on mundane activities like chores.

The *entire point* is to not have to think about or tend to real life. 

This mentality is often reflected by proponents of the three day weekend, because if Saturday is filled with catching up on things you couldn’t do because of work, and on Sunday you have to prepare for work the next day, you don’t really have an “off” day, mentally.

So to me, it doesn’t make sense to start a leisure activity if I have to think of/remember responsibilities that I need to tend to before the next day.

What I think upsets people’s sense of normalcy most is that I would rather *do nothing* (lay down or nap, read on my phone, etc.) during an interim period between responsibilities, instead of taking advantage of what I call “time confetti”, by doing something for like 20 minutes or even an hour.

I simply don’t derive much pleasure from something with responsibilities hanging over my head, like I can’t fully immerse myself in such a brief leisure activity.

An undeniably productive effect of this mentality is that I would rather get things like shopping out of the way after work than to have it intrude on a day off from work.

To be clear though, I don’t have an issue with delaying gratification. I will do whatever work and responsibilities that I need to, I can choose not to use substances with ease, and I’ve even voluntarily taken up to a year off at a time from using substances. 

PSA: get treatment, stick with it, etc. I’m just seeking other perspectives about this particular subject and I’m not advocating for anyone else to do anything that I do.",1754440997.0,1,0,OCD,ocd

1mijkcq,Has anyone else been triggered by changing your hair color?,"Hello,

I was recently diagnosed with severe OCD. I'm learning that I truly didn't know anything about OCD at all. 

I have colored my hair black for a decade now, but decided to change things up a bit a few weeks ago. I tried going for an ashy brown, but things didn't go the way I planned. I ended up with my natural copper hair color instead and it feels like I'm living in a nightmare. Genuinely. My daily reality feels like a nightmare without any actual nightmarish events happening.

I traced it back to the day I colored my hair. That makes me feel like I need to just dye it back to black and move on. I hate thinking about my hair because it stresses me out. I feel too visible and vulnerable with my natural color, but it's so beautiful it breaks my heart to continue to cover it. This makes me think that the immediate urge to dye it back to black is a compulsion, and I should probably just sit in this discomfort. As dramatic as it sounds, this discomfort is agonizing and I hate it. 

I just don't know if there's a point where it's more harmful to sit in the discomfort than it would be to just dye it. I'm on the waitlist for therapy and my body isn't tolerating my new medication well.  

I'm not sure what to do, but I do know I need to do something (not necessarily giving into the compulsion), because I can't leave the house at all right now. Has anyone else experienced this?

I had good skin but got bad because of showering too much, I had beautiful hair but it got damaged (again because of too much shower), these are almost easy fix but now the problem got too huge to ignore, I know I should get a check up because the pain started getting worse but I don't wanna because 1- hospital is full of people and dirty. 2- I secretly wish for my own death.
What should I do? How will it get better? I know I'm at the fault but I can't stop. ( I'm sorry for bad English)

1miaz7n,Bugs - anyone else?,"spiders, flies, moths etc. I am not scared of them as animals but i am scared they will somehow be in my mouth, fly in, crawl in while im alseep, fall into my drink.

I constantly check for spiders and such before i sleep, i feel phantom bugs crawling on me sometimes or see something thats nothing, its like im constantly paranoid. 

I spend a whole night looking for a spider that idk was even real or just a visual hallucination (i used to get them alot when i was really stressed). 

I am constantly checking my drink, even if i cover the top so nothing can get in. 

If i see a spider, i instantly feel in in my mouth, back of my throat even when i can still see it. It will make me gag or choke. 

If i am with a spider in a confide space like a car and i lose it/ cant see it anymore, i will get out and refuse to go back in untill its out the car or dead and even then i constantly feel like their is spiders crawling on me.

I’ve read everywhere that OCD can cause tics in some way but I don’t understand, are the tics fake and caused by an urge with OCD?

1mi91n3,Do you make up a “logical reason” on why you do a compulsion?,"I am going to try and explain this but not really sure how to put it in words.

So I am not diagnosed yet, this is a more recent *possible* discovery for myself. I actually have my first therapy appointment next week!! And even if I am not diagnosed, I still find myself having OCD tendencies.

My question is in relevance to when I find myself doing what I believe to be a compulsion I convince myself of a logical reason.
For example, I used to have these “lucky pants” I would wear to exams that for I would think helped me do well. The only thing is that it was like a I HAD to wear these pants. I went home and changed into them once cause I forgot to wear them and it made me anxious. What I would tell myself is “if I change then I don’t even have to think about it anymore, cause if I don’t then it’s gonna stress me out and I won’t be focused on the exam”
I know this is silly, but it would make me anxious at the time. Even tho I didn’t always wear them to exams and would get an A, or I would wear them and still not do well, I was convinced that I still needed them on during the exam to feel ready. 
I do this with other things too, like when I maybe have to pee before bed, I tell myself that in order to not worry about it I should just go to the bathroom so it is out of my head, except for I sometimes will go to the bathroom like 3 times in the space of 45 mins if I still can’t sleep. 
I don’t get the whole stereotypical “if I don’t wear these pants then I will fail and my family will die” mine usually comes in the thought of “so I can achieve mental clarity or peace”….which in a way seems logical to me cause why would I want to be stressing…. If that makes sense.

I’m just curious if this is the feeling or mental hoops that others also experience or if I’m just way off mark about it.",1754400085.0,7,10,OCD,ocd

1mio2fa,I have OCD,"Hey everyone! I hope you're all doing well. 

So I'm terrified to open up bout this, but I feel that it is necessary for my wellbeing and for the wellbeing of others too. For over 10 years, I've suffered from OCD, but I've never been diagnosed. The reason that I know it's OCD is that every time I have a harmful thought about hurting someone, including my own family, sometimes my brain starts to play this game on me. For example, why did you think of this? Do you like this thought? Do you want to harm anyone? maybe secretly you do? This is NOT TRUE. I don't like hurting anyone. I would never hurt anyone. I love being kind, caring, and empathic on this earth, but every time I feel powerless, small, or when someone invalidates my feelings, or I don't feel like my voice has been heard or understood. It's like my brain gets set on fire, and all these dark, intrusive thoughts start to come up, and it makes me want to cry. What scares me the most is that I believe these thoughts, even though I know deep down that they're not true. When I mean dark and intrusive thoughts, I mean Sexual and harmful. I'm ashamed to admit it, because I know that I'm not a bad person. I feel things so deeply, and I have a lot of empathy. When these thoughts come up, I feel like a bad person and that I should be in prison, but this is how the game is played. Our brains are so powerful that they play tricks on us. I haven't been able to open up about this because I've been so afraid to. I usually start to have these thoughts when my feelings are constantly being dismissed or invalidated. I also start to feel triggered, especially when someone tries to control what I say or do. I like to be in control of my own life, but when someone takes control of me, it literally pulls that trauma trigger, and then I start to have these dark and horrible thoughts in my head. I've been controlled by my parents all my life, and I'm trying to take control of my own life now, so if I feel that someone is trying to control me, then that usually sets me off again. These thoughts can become so overwhelming to the point that I can't focus or concentrate. Recently, I've been having harmful sexual thoughts, which I don't want to mention, but they started because I did something nice for my dad and his wife. I decorated and cleaned the house a little, and I got my dad's wife a candle. My dad did say thank you for putting the banners up and the decorations, but I got no thank you from his wife for the gift or for putting up the decorations. She completely blanked me out, did not say a word. This angered me to the core, and this is when dark and harmful thoughts started flooding in. I need to speak up about this more because the more I talk about it, the more I feel safe in my mind, body, and soul. 

I would like to thank each one of you for taking the time to read my post today. I do wish you all the best with your recovery, and if any of this resonates with anyone, then feel free to leave a comment.

1mig6xb,Information on OCD,"TLDR at bottom. Sorry if I do something wrong in this post but I’ve been reading this sub for a bit and was wondering if anyone can recommend some reliable reading material on OCD & more specifically the types and different ways it can manifest?

I’m not diagnosed with OCD but it has been pointed out to me many times for many years now by friends, family, coworkers & medical professionals that it’s a possibility. I’ve largely ignored it, convincing myself that my behaviours are normal however about a year ago I was diagnosed and medicated for ADHD, and my psychiatrist (who also noted some OCD-adjacent things but wanted to first get the ADHD under control) said that once I start the ADHD meds any other comorbid conditions may make themselves more apparent.

It has, to the point even I can see how these things affect me negatively and those around me. I’m considering asking my psych about it, but still convincing myself it isn’t true and everyone else is wrong. 

As I said I’m not diagnosed and don’t claim to have OCD, but reading posts here has made me realise that the way I view OCD is very narrow and there’s actually far more to it than what I think of when I hear the name. Hence why I am requesting any good sites or articles for information so I can better understand it and decide whether to pursue the matter with my psych. I’ve googled of course but there’s so much conflicting information and some seems unreliable, it’s just confusing for me who doesn’t fully understand the disorder. Thanks! Sorry for the rant lol.

1mibvbs,a post about recovery for those who need hope!,"hi! it has been i think half a year since my last post here. first of all i want to say thank you. a lot of people answered my posts begging and desperate for help. i did not reply back because i was not on the best state and i think it was better not to fuel the compulsion of seeking reassurance, but y’all genuinely helped me.

it all exploded back in october, although i have been obsessive ever since i was born — my therapist told me some minds have a greater tendency for this. in october, after a while of not feeling alright, i started feeling EXTREME anxiety due to somatic ocd, and started going to therapy. i soon became afraid of thoughts flooding my mind with me being unable to control them, and so it happened. i was so afraid i barely went out of my house, out of my bed. being alone felt like the greatest nightmare but being with people didn’t feel right either. i felt like i had no exit, i just waited for days to pass so i could go to sleep and stop thinking (which, by the way, it took some time until i was able to sleep alone again), to then wake up with extreme anxiety and start again. headaches all the time, no energy, stopped eating, felt so weak.

and then it happened. i lost beloved friend due to suicide. that same month. life didn’t feel real.

it was an all time low for myself. but it passed. i made myself sit with the obsessions and anxiety through the doubt, did ERP therapy, forced myself (gently) to eat at least a bit, to tidy my room, take care of my hygiene, to go to class, to go out with my friends, even if it felt wrong, little by little. some days i failed and other days i stood up for myself and went to class even if i felt like i was going crazy. and everything got better.

this is not to say it was easy. my obsessions have been shifting: relational, hit&run, health, contamination, perfection, existential, schizophrenia, and other obsessions i do not even know how to name and i wish i could stop collecting them like pins lol. i’m currently struggling the most with relational ocd but other thoughts come and go in waves. and other things happened in my life, too.

but everything is SO MUCH BETTER now. it’s difficult to convey HOW MUCH everything has changed. i still have a lot of anxiety and obsessive thoughts are pretty much there but i started to feel like before again. when everything started i didn’t think i could finish my degree but i graduated in july 🥹 i spend a lot of time with myself now and enjoy it instead of feeling fear, i have done a few trips which is amazing cause i wouldn’t have imagined even being away from home for a day.

i don’t know if there is anybody that will relate to this. sometimes i feel like i’m exaggerating but it has truly felt like i’ve been through hell.

i still have some way ahead, and i do have terrible days due to ocd, but i swear it has nothing to do with my life back in october. if i could give myself some tips back then it would be these:
- be patient and sit with the anxiety, it is the only way, but it will get better
- do things. i know things get tough, and i know the fear, but do them. and each time try to do more. it’s ok if you fail, but try!
- go out, even if you don’t feel like it. it helped me even if was feeling terrible while doing it
- stop doing your compulsions. i know it’s hard. i do them. but it’s key!!!!
- get rest and eat well. our overthinking minds need it

i feel like everything i said might be like what we all have heard before 😭 but idk, this is my experience and i hope this helps anyone who needs it. thank you for reading if you got to this point of the post lol ❤️ let’s recover together!!!!!!

He is not officially diagnosed with OCD and I am no mental health professional. I only studied psychology in undergrad and when he talked about some of the things that send him into panic, I mentioned OCD (again not a professional). He thought that he was just crazy for having these thoughts. 

He has not sought out mental health support yet but we've talked about it. However, it's been very difficult for me because I am not sure how to comfort him during episodes. I am a highly empathetic person and I want to support him. But when he starts to panic, he gets as much distance from me as he can and physically leaves the room or locks himself away. 

I understand that this can be scary and I want to provide as much support as I can to him without overstepping or making it worse.

1mhtr1l,An Exercise That Might Help All Of Us (NOT Reassurance),"The inspiration for this exercise is Nathan Peterson on YouTube, who says a helpful exercise is to pretend you don't have OCD. This means stepping out of our ""stuck"" brain and into the brain of someone who doesn't have OCD. Some acting is involved. How would people without OCD see our fears and anxieties? They wouldn't get obsessive and compulsive like we do because their brain operates normally. The ideal is for our OCD brain to transition to that non-OCD brain. I read that a non-OCD brain gets an intrusive thought and simply moves past it. An OCD brain gets stuck on that intrusive thought, and that's how OCD begins.

You notice how you're irrational about your OCD but perfectly rational about other people's? It's like our brains are only crazy about our specific OCD, and then we're normal people when it comes to things outside of it. So, here's what I think: As long as it's not our theme, let's reply to each other's OCDs with what a ""normal"" mindset should be. How we rationally see their situation and how they also should see it.

For example, say your OCD involves a fear of stabbing someone. I don't struggle with that, so I can tell you the ""normal"", non-OCD person perspective on this (i.e. how you should see it). Here goes: Last week, I got a random image of myself stabbing someone. But I know it doesn't mean anything. It's just an image. I thought, ""Whoa, weird, haha."" And then I moved on. I didn't think I was abnormal or strange. I didn't freak out that some subconscious desire was breaching the surface. Intrusive thoughts are normal. Maybe this one came from watching violent movies. Maybe my brain was just bored and came up with a startling image. I don't know, and I don't care. This whole thing lasted a second.

Does anyone want to try this? I think it's a great way to get fresh insight and a rational perspective. We're so consumed by our OCDs that it's almost impossible to see outside of it. It'd be nice to have a blueprint, a model on how normal, every day people encounter our situations and simply move past it - without getting *stuck*. If we see life through their eyes, we'll see our OCD is nothing to fear.",1754351262.0,38,18,OCD,ocd

My most recent one is convincing myself that i cannot comprehend things. concepts, words, etc., I have to verbally confirm that I know what things mean. For example, if someone tells me something like “You have to drive down the street to get to the grocery store,” my brain will convince itself that it doesn’t know what driving and grocery stores are. So i’ll have to break down these concepts in my mind: “yes, driving is when you get into a car, step on the gas, use the steering wheel, etc. and a grocery store is a place where people buy food items.”
This is even worse when i convince myself that I don’t know what basic vocabulary words mean. I recently had to make sure i actually knew what the word “and” meant, and assure myself that i’ve been using it correctly all my life.

The current one is someone called me babe on a TikTok I posted about having ocd. Their comment was “oh babe💔💔💔” but my brain was like if you don’t tell her you’re hiding stuff and then she’ll think your a cheater or something (I’m not a cheater I find cheating deplorable) but I can’t stop",1754379179.0,5,2,OCD,ocd
1midjo9,How to stop myself from compulsively repeating over my obsession? (M 20),"       I haven’t found a real answer to my specific problem or situation. I’ll get to the brass tacks of it. I moved across country before my ex girlfriend with her mom, we were supposed to be living with her mom together as a couple. She broke up with me and is blaming not coming out here on not wanting to be around me. I’d be a liar to say things weren’t a little rough, but to go about it like this is still mind boggling to me. 

       My mental health was already not in the best spot, but my OCD seemed to stop honestly for awhile. I’m at the point now where I physically cannot shake it and all of my obsessions that lead to my compulsions stem from her. I don’t want to say the obsession because i’m scared even speaking on it will cause some freak incident to come out of it. 

       My compulsions are for example, touching things the right way repeatedly and or till it feels right. (Door knobs/handles, light switches, phone screen, positioning the cursor in the middle of the icon I want to click and other things) Hand washing a certain way. (Not a contamination situation, It just needs to be done properly and routinely after every bathroom use) Walking up the stairs a certain way. (Right foot first, left foot second on the same step all the way up, I need to reset if it isn’t right) Typing on my phone. (Not letting autocorrect finish it, restarting the word if spelt wrong, putting correct grammar) 

       It’s eating at my brain, I feel myself slipping more and more. I’m crying because it gets to be to much, I keep getting caught up in loops that I can’t break. This specific obsession is destroying me and it all stems from her. I can’t afford therapy at the moment. Making music, friends, video games and youtube/adult cartoons are the only things that help me recently, some of them are either not working enough or i’m beating myself up over abilities. 

       I don’t even want to make this post i’m so worried. In ways i’m doing decent at telling myself to stop but it hasn’t been enough. I think more than anything I need to hear someone who has no bias. I need to hear some form of comfort. My OCD has been at play my entire life. (Grandma on moms side has/had more of my form pretty bad, aunt on dads side has/had super bad contamination OCD) it’s been awhile since it’s been this bad. (Ex was pregnant I obsessed over the baby not making it, I did all of my rituals and it still turned out to become true. This month also marks 1 year since we found out) I just need an escape or someone to tell me i’m not that crazy.

1micyrq,Stopped taking Prozac. Violent thoughts are back.,"Doc diagnosed me with OCD due to symptoms of obsessive violent thoughts. Prozac took away the violent thoughts completely. But on my medicine I was just so bored and grumpy. I relapsed to alcohol at the bar with friends and stopped taking my Prozac. I feel great when I’m socializing and my libido is back even but man every night in my dreams it’s kill or be killed. Then I have my intrusive thoughts when I’m awake now.

I’m so bored with my life when I’m on medication. But I’m scared of myself and others are scared of me when I’m off my meds. Getting an emotional support chihuahua today, hopefully that helps. 

Ever been burnt out by the medication life? I’m not satisfied medicated but I’m scary when I’m off my meds. I’m unsure what to do.

1miceze,ERP and driving,"Curious if anyone has experience with ERP for driving or if my story resonates.

Seven years ago, I took driver's ed in two weeks and got my license. During that time, I was genuinely a great driver, but it feels like a completely different lifetime. I never really practiced with my parents after driver's ed because they weren't the most patient, and I never ended up driving alone.

My OCD has always been around, but driving didn't become a theme until after I took driver's ed and went a while without driving - and my grandparents got in a freak accident that they never fully recovered from. (Spoiler alert: my intrusive thoughts tell me I'm going to cause a similar accident).

I became hyper aware of everything going on around the car while I was a passenger. Fast forward to now, and I have learned to somewhat deal with thoughts about other drivers because they are out of my control (which has made me somewhat more calm as a passenger), but I cannot seem to trust myself as a driver. I have issues with relinquishing control in every part of my life except driving - I would much rather give my family, friends, Uber drivers, etc. that responsibility. And even beyond driving, having a car to maintain seems like far too much of a responsibility that I can't handle.

I haven't really needed to drive because I went to college in a walkable town and I now work remotely, but I would like to move out of my childhood home and live with my boyfriend. We're both interested in moving about an hour away, and I think it would be really important for me to be able to drive to see my family and friends, to appointments, and even just to things that would bring me joy without relying on anyone, especially him.

In the past couple months, my therapist (who does not specialize in OCD) and I have been working on just getting me in the car and around my neighborhood. I've done it a few times in the past couple months, but it does not feel natural - it's as if I've never been in a drivers seat before. And even as I get more comfortable with it, I just cannot get myself to drive on a main road because I'm convinced I'll screw up badly. I'm trying to find an ERP therapist who can do telehealth, but options are limited.

Just curious if anyone has any advice, thoughts, or success stories.",1754407967.0,1,1,OCD,ocd
1mic5rt,Looking for help for my brother struggling with magical thinking OCD,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m really worried about my brother. He seems to be struggling with magical thinking OCD. It’s been affecting his life significantly — he spends all day at home, avoids going out, and has become extremely isolated.

He was receiving treatment in the past. He had started medication and was working with a psychologist doing exposure therapy. However, after experiencing a side effect from the medication, he stopped everything — both the meds and the therapy. Since then, things have only gotten worse. He doesn’t want to talk to me anymore or even see me, and I feel like I’m slowly losing my connection with him.

He refuses to seek help again, and I’m trying to respect his boundaries — but at the same time, I’m deeply concerned and don’t know how to support him without making things worse.

How can I help him without pushing him further away? Any advice or insight would be truly appreciated.

Thank you so much.

1mi2fv1,I’m moving and havent been able to sleep,"Hi all, I’m moving in a couple weeks and it’s absolutely destroying my health. I can’t sleep, I’ve gotten sick, and I’m so restless just checking notes and shit over and over again in my head. 
I did the math, the place I’m moving isn’t far, it’s cheaper, and it’s bigger. It’s an upgrade in every way possible but my fucking brain won’t let me be excited. There’s something about packing my stuff into boxes that is making my brain scream into fight or flight mode. I don’t want to be a hoarder but it’s so hard to downsize all the stuff I don’t need, even if it’s stuff that’s been in my closet forgotten about for years now. Even at work I can’t focus because I’m just going over everything I need to do over and over again. I wrote it down to try and help, but it’s still absolutely killing me inside.

1mi271x,HELP: “perfect” note-taking compulsion is ruining my life,"I need all the advice I can get, I will do anything to make this stop.

I know overcoming these things take time but I have not even been able to take the first step. I have had this issue since high school, but it was nothing compared to how it is now. This obsession is so strong that consumes 90% of my studying time and I barely get anything done, including assignments. I feel completely hopeless.

I have wasted HOURS of my time rewriting my notes to make them “perfect”, aligning words by the letter and reorganizing notes around the page (Ex. I’ll spend 8 hours on a whole page). My wrist aches so bad to the point that I fear it has caused long term damage, since this pain lasts throughout summer vacation (4 months). I have been to therapy for this (didn’t help much tbh) but I can’t even afford to go back at the moment. I have tried so hard to just leave my notes, to just let it be imperfect but this “need” has gotten so strong I cannot stop myself from ignoring it.

I type out my notes on my laptop WHENEVER it is possible, but most of my college work requires me to handwrite. After writing sessions I think about all the time that I wasted, and what I could have completed in that time and it makes me feel sick, anxious, depressed.

(I’m diagnosed with both OCD and ADHD in case anyone was wondering.)

TLDR: This “need” to perfect my notes is taking a MAJOR toll on me -physically and mentally- and I need any advice, methods or resources to overcome this, please help me.",1754377052.0,5,2,OCD,ocd
