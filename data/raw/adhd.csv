What I’d really like to do instead is avoid everything job-search-related and instead work on my favourite current hyperfixation/hobby (sewing clothes) and go to a nearby thrift shop to look at fabrics, which would be so fun and make me so happy, but instead I’m also avoiding doing anything fun that I would actually enjoy because I feel guilty about not doing the resume thing and in my mind “I don’t deserve it”.

1mqev4f,"Burned out after 5 months in a 5-day office job — can’t sleep, commute is awful, and I feel like I’m falling apart","Hey everyone,

I’ve been in my current job for about 5 months. It’s fully in-office, 5 days a week, and I’m completely burned out.

Here’s the situation:
Every Sunday night, I cannot sleep before the work week starts.
My sleep in general is bad — I wake up tired and it affects everything.
My commute is awful: 3 hours a day on public transportation.
The office environment feels like a terrible fit for me — culturally, socially, and in terms of focus. I’m introverted, easily distracted, and just drained.
They’re offering to go through the ADA accommodation process, but I can’t bring myself to call this a “disability” — it feels more like my personality just doesn’t match this job.
In this market, remote jobs feel impossible to get. I job-searched for two years before landing this one.
Now I’m at the point where my health is suffering and it’s affecting my marriage. My husband has said he’s worried about me and about us. He’s burned out because of my burnout. We don’t have kids yet, and I really wanted to be a great wife and help with income — but I feel like I’m failing on all fronts.
I’ve been thinking about changing directions completely, maybe becoming a health coach (it’s my passion). But in this economy, it feels risky and maybe even foolish.
I honestly don’t know if I’m “ghosting myself” by thinking about leaving, or if I should just push through. Right now I just know I’m exhausted and unhappy.
Has anyone been through something similar? How do you know if it’s time to cut your losses versus hang on? And if you’ve made a big career change while burned out, how did you do it without imploding your life?
Thanks for reading this long vent. Any advice or perspective would help.",1755209166.0,24,7,ADHD,adhd

But while I waited for a response (that never came) I did some research and turns out I’m not alone in this and that they have scammed others preying on our disabilities (and apparently they don’t issue refunds to those who ask for them as well). I then called my bank and explained the situation and sheepishly admitted the embarrassing truth: I didn’t notice being charged quarterly by two apps… 

After the bank call, I also left a review on the Clarify app explaining what happened to me in the hopes of warning others to not trust that app.

Alot of these probably don't sound bad on the surface, but it was torturous *because* of having ADHD. If you get what I mean, then you get what I mean.

Because I'm doing so many different activities during the day I make a mess but by the time I'm done I'm tired and want to go to bed. It's not awful but it is untidy. I don't see it as a fire or health hazard ok sometimes I leave something on the stove top but it's not even turned on at the wall and it most likely it will be a baking tray. 

A lady came to visit (something to do with this supported accomomidation I'm in) and apparently she said to my support workers it's not up to her standards. I've seen houses and flats much messier than mine and dirtier. When I get low things can get out of hand yes. I feel really down about it because I thought I was doing well, especially compared to what I was like 3 years ago but they didn't know me then and they can't see how much I have improved I had a couple of staff from my old home visit one was my old key worker and she was happy with how good things where looking she worked with me for 10years. 

I have my support workers body double 3 times a week to help. It doesn't get to the point where you can't see floor which my bedroom used to get like frequently and my dishes don't sit on the side for weeks I don't end up having to do 3 loads of laundry in one day (I thought I was doing well. I moved here in November so these people don't know what my old place was like. 

My family and friends who visited me in my old place almost always say ""flats looking good"" when they come round. Luckily there's a support worker who also has ADHD and she understands the wanting to do something but can't do it feeling.

1mqlby5,Suggestions on learning self-love,"Hi. I've made a bit of a mess of my life, due to a combination of ADHD, anxiety and general bad decisions. I think that to improve things, I probably need to learn to love myself a bit. The problem is, I don't. I find myself exasperating and if I work really hard, I can be a person who doesn't completely infuriate me. I'm still not thrilled to be me, it's more that I've earned tolerance for the day. From what I've read and what I've heard from counselors, this is not a great way to live. Certainly I keep making decisions I regret. And it's absolutely not a way I would want, for instance, my daughter with ADHD to ever feel. But when I search around for any kind of positive feelings for myself, there's not a whole lot there. Mostly what I see are the fear, indecision, lack of focus and difficulty with ordinary adulting. Does anyone have advice on self-love as learned skill? Thank you. ",1755225869.0,5,6,ADHD,adhd

1mq6d1b,Time to process emotions,"Whenever I have a difficult conversation with my wife, I'm listening and contributing as much as I can, focusing on what she is trying to tell me. But afterwards I tend to take 2 days to process how I feel. This usually means I'm lost in thought, very withdrawn, sitting silently in my own zone. I realize that this has been my 'normal' for a long time. I'm ambivalent about most things and dont have an immediate reaction for almost anything. Some rare stuff maybe I have immediater reactions, often always when I realize I fucked up I guess. 

As a child I was sensitive and very emotional. Now I can say I'm someone who feels very deeply, when I feel. But then when I feel part takes time. I sit blank or overwhelmed for a day or two and then maybe get to addressing whatever it was. 

Is that an ADHD characteristic? On top of my ADHD I've also been a chronic people pleaser as far as I've remembered. 

Now I'm starting to wonder if this - very less reaction to things -  is a defence mechanism I slowly got on from my childhood. And probably that's why difficult conversations with the wife is overwhelming me to the point I blank out afterwards.

1mq8nc2,Antidepressants never again!,"I have been taking Ritalin for over 10 years and it has always helped me a lot. It turns out that I always had moments of depression that I tried to treat with antidepressants (among others). Result: ALL of them influenced the effect of Ritalin. 

My last try was brintellix. I was optimistic at first, but from the second month onwards it started giving me the same effects as all the others I've used (there were MANY). Excessive sleep, lack of feelings, poor memory, procrastination, nausea, lack of libido and mainly blocking the effect of Ritalin. 

Anyway, if on the one hand they help us stop thinking about bad things, reduce anxiety and make you ""give a fuck"", on the other hand they leave you completely alienated from the world (at least in my case). Enough of that, I decided that I'm going to try to stick to Ritalin (the only one that helps me get out of bed and get on with my life) and deal with moments of depression and anxiety with rivotril and therapy.

And while admittedly a big part of me was hoping for some confirmation of my self-diagnosis that would ultimately result in some medication to help me, I was a bit put off by how quickly the PMHNP jumped to “alright let’s get you on some meds!”. We weren’t even 5 minutes into the conversation before we were talking about the different options for prescriptions, with the end result being that I just needed an EKG first and should do some of my own research on the three options to see which one I thought would suit me best.

1mqmo4o,Vyvanse side effects,"Okay, so I got diagnosed ADHD-Inattentive type at age 30. I am on 30mg dose and finishing my second month. It seems to work very well for me, but a couple of side effects I am struggling with:

1. Hair loss. I know this is probably more of a direct result of the appetite suppressant part of it; I have a hard time making myself eat most of the day. But to try and combat this, I have made sure I eat something with enough protein in the mornings and a good dinner in the evenings, since I likely won't eat lunch during the day. I drink SO MUCH water, and even supplement with liquid IVs to help. Yet, I am still losing so much hair. My question: Will my body eventually level out and I stop shedding so much hair, or do I expect this to be a lasting side effect?
2. Upper back and neck soreness/tightness. Even without medication, I have a really bad habit of tensing my shoulders, but the Vyvanse definitely exacerbates it. I have started making myself hyper-aware and try to relax, but even on days when I don't do much, it is still achy and tight. What do I do about this? I have been finding myself taking an anti-inflammatory daily, but I know that's not good, also.
3. The comedown. I think the 30mg works great for me, but I notice the come down is approaching much faster than it did when I first started. What helps control this? I've seen some people saying they got on a higher dose, or their doctor would prescribe them a ""booster"" dose to take in the afternoon. I am up at 5:30 am every day due to kids in school, so come 1 PM, I am already feeling the comedown effects, and I still have most of the afternoon left to try and push through. So what are we doing about this? Lol
All in all, the benefits outweigh the negatives for me. I was living my life on HARD mode until this diagnosis and medications, and I do not want to go back to that daily struggle.

When i woke up today, i wanted to continue with cleaning and organising... but i ended up just staring at the mess for a good half hour, browsing reddit mindlessly for another 2 hours before going to work feeling exhausted, and not having done anything (my sheets are still in the washing machine)..

I just feel im at a stage if my life where brute forcing my way through tasks is no longer cutting it and i need some advice, how to consistsntly do things i want to do...?

Yes, I am medicated, and still, some days/ weeks, i feel exhausted by just waking up, and despite wanting a clean organised house, and healthy meals etc, It's like a disconnect between what i want to do and what i actually end up doing..

When i was at uni 8 years ago, I would procrastinate starting my work, despite really wanting to, until the very last 2/3 days, where i would ""brute force"" my way through, and write up a 10 page report due to the pressure/ stress etc. I really want to have a better grasp and technique of doing stuff in my life, without relying on some external stress amd pressure.. 

Please, if you have any techniques that work for you, share them, as I hope i will learn something that helps me become more productive and on top of things.. ",1755225755.0,2,1,ADHD,adhd
1mqhkau,College ADHD Productivity Questions,"TLDR: I can build a beautiful organization / productivity setup, but I overload it with tasks and eventually quit. Overdue stuff snowballs, and I end up avoiding the whole thing. Need help making this ADHD-friendly so I can actually stick to it.

# For some background info:

I’m a college sophomore, pretty sure I have ADHD (planning to get evaluated). I love creating systems to organize myself (clean UI and data visualization is a weakness) and I’m great at organizing information. But after the “fun build” phase, my follow-through tanks.

# What I currently use: Cajun Koi’s Notion organization template with my own “life buckets”:

* **Academic:** Pages for each class with assignments, notes, deadlines
* **Future Planning:** Internship apps, networking, side projects
* **Personal:** Life admin, hobbies, workout goals (my current hyperfixation lol)

Everything feeds into a master task database with mastery levels, completion %, etc. which immediately goes into my Notion calendar. 

# My biggest problems are

* I dump every task into the system (though tbf I've been trying to be more intentional), then feel so overwhelmed that I just stop opening it.
   * For example, I'm working on a side project and I literally dumped microsteps for the entire timeline and now its overwhelming asf
* If I miss a task, I just drag it to the next day until I’m staring at a mountain of red “overdue” tasks and avoiding the system entirely.
* Seeing the same task day after day makes my brain stop noticing it.
* Feels like I spend more time “managing” the system than actually doing the work.

# Questions for yall (but please feel free to drop any other suggestions, too)

1. How do you keep your task list realistic so you actually open it every day and get it done?
2. Any way to recover myself without deleting everything and starting over?
3. What helps you notice and actually act on stale tasks?
4. Any Notion-specific tips? 
5. How do you stop the system from becoming a chore in itself?",1755215714.0,3,2,ADHD,adhd

1mptfz2,Is Organized ADHD a thing?,"Background (or skip): Just 2 years ago I found out I have ADHD at 28 yo. I grew up in an orphanage and it was extremely structured and strict. like 1 hour homework / study everyday no matter what. And since I live in Germany and grew up in a semi-public space, the bureaucracy was intense and I had to do so many forms and paperwork even as a young teen at 12 yo.   
  
So I really learned to file and organize everything as if I'm a federal institution. That helped me a lot to stay organized especially with running my own business. Everything has its place, I almost never not find something, I even archive stuff after 10 years.

1mqhby9,help with afternoon crash,"Hello!! I’m looking for some advice/tips on how to deal with super low energy around 5-6pm.

For reference, I take 30mg of XR dextroamphetamine around 7am, and I have a 15mg IR that I usually take when I get home around 5:30/6. 

I’m currently in vet school, so I have a long day of lectures and labs from 8-5, with a one hour break for lunch (12-1). When I get home, I usually take about an hour to let my dog out, decompress, eat dinner, etc, and I start studying right after that (once the IR kicks in). 

My main issue is with crashing super hard once I get done with my last class, which makes it hard for me to pick back up studying that evening. In a perfect world, I could go to the gym after class, take some pre workout, and study the rest of the night after, but then I’m having to deal with the 6pm crowd at the gym which is no fun.

1mqm5wh,Why did my psych change what drug I'm on instead of upping the doseage?,"I know this sub is no substitute for medical advice sorry however I didn't think to ask my psych whilst I was there and I'm not seeing them for another 4 months so a long time to wait to ask a question.

I started taking medication for ADHD for the first time this year. I was prescribed dexamfetamine and told to start on 5mg twice a day and then go up to 10mg twice a day (so total 20mg) if it was not working after a week. I had a boost in energy and mild side effects the first few days after I started and after I upped to 10mg however since then have felt as if I am just taking sugar pills. I have zero benefits or side effects, and the only way I can even tell I've taken them is that if I drink coffee afterwards I get a buzz, which I never used to get from caffeine. However other than that I would not be able to tell if I was taking them or not.

I told my psychiatrist this and he switched me to Ritalin. He wrote me a prescription for 10mg four times a day and told me to start with 1 10mg a day and slowly up the dose to a max of 40mg a day.

I'm just wondering if anyone can give me insight into why he would have switched drugs instead of upping the dosage for dexamfetamine? Since I was having zero side effects on it. My understanding of stimulant prescribing is that you are supposed to start low and slowly increase the dosage until the required effect is achieved or the side effects are intolerable? I googled and the max dexamfetamine prescribers in my state can prescribe daily is 50mg, so at 20mg a day I'm well below the max.

If it is relevant at all, I have benign bradycardia (resting HR around 50) so I'm fairly sure stimulant effects on the heart aren't an issue?

Any insights would be very helpful!",1755228241.0,0,6,ADHD,adhd

For instance, I was planning out a home network today.  I was trying to make decisions on what equipment to buy and how to wire my home.

Another example.  When I approach my finances, when I see my credit card balances I begin to try to figure out how to pay things off, how much interest I'm being charged, etc.  Next thing I know, the walls are closing in on me.

It's 38/100 degrees out, and the pool is lovely. My wife and kids were dipping their toes into the water this morning, goading each other to get in. Even though the water is lovely, and they've all been in before and know that the initial ""shock"" of cool is brief, they couldn't bring themselves to get in. Eventually, after much goading, toe dipping, convincing, and teasing, they throw themselves in and say: ""It's not bad at all!"" We laugh about why we were all reticent to get in, and yet will repeat the exact same dance tomorrow, and every day of our holiday to come.

I tell my family: ""That's my brain for EVERYTHING, EVERY SINGLE DAY"".

Getting out of bed, brushing my teeth, sitting at my laptop to start work, making a phone call, booking flights, attending an appointment. All these things start exactly the same way: anxiety and reticence to ""just jump in"" despite having done those things a thousand times and knowing full well ""they are not bad at all"". And it's the same story, every day. 

It really helped to be able to explain in terms my family could immediately relate to. And it felt really good to give my kids a baseline against which they might be able to spot signs of their own anxiety and be able to talk to us about how they feel.

Since a year of two, I've noticed that I need to be either playing a very engaging video game (an RP or reading a very engaging book (like fantasy sagas with 3-10 books). 
Whenever I'm not, I feel restless and can't stop looking for something to do.

And I always need some novelty, I can't replay a game right after finishing it. Same for books, though I'm more easily addicted to games than books.
Also, I can't watch a tv series or something, because it just doesn't take as much of my attention as the other media. I need something that keeps my hands busy as well as my brain, otherwise it doesn't work.

As you've probably heard too many times, I ""hope"" I got it because otherwise I guess I'm just weird and stupid for other reasons haha.

I've heard caffeine often makes ADHD people sleepy, but for me, that's not the case. I wonder if this is common. I do think it gives me energy, but more like mental energy. Not kind of energy that I would use for running on the walls. I'm usually slightly hyperactive, like standing, tapping my feet or going circles on my chair rather than staying still, but caffeine doesn't seem to make my hyperactivity worse, at least not clearly.

I like to drink caffeine before band trainings, exams, or doing exercise, because it helps me to focus and stay motivated and stay in the moment. If I'm stressed it calms me down a little. When life gets rough, I get kinda addicted, but it's not that I would fall asleep without coffee. It's more like it makes me happy and relaxed in situations where I wouldn't be that otherwise. I also love morning coffee because I like the taste and the relaxed moment in the beginning of the day. After that, I'm ready to go, but idk if it's because of caffeine, plasebo, or a slow start (I'm not a morning person, so I hate just running to work/studies/gym straight from the bed).

I’ve felt like it builds up in my system as I take it and then gets to a day where I just can’t anymore. The same happened with Adderall. But I’m unsure if I’m maybe it’s just activating my nervous system in a way that’s not ideal (but is also helping my brain still run better on stress).

1mq808j,Organizing desk,"So I am a renter and I use as a desk a dinner table that came in the appartment. I would like a desk, but I am not sure what to do with the huge dinner table then (renter is an old lady and doesn't have where to put it)

So in the meantime, I use this table for work, makeup, coloring, origami, eating and basically everything. I tend to gather around me things that I use such as body moisturizer and leave in conditioner. 

The biggest issue tho is that the table is huge. I have some organizers and boxes and pouches in the other end of the table with stationary, notebooks, makeup, medicine, markers, etc. But it is impossible to reach back with my hand to get something. And when I need to take something, I get up and get it and then leave it wherever.

I have huge issues with organising, not only the desk, but my wardrobe and beauty stuff as well. I have been strggling with depression for 8 years, got diagnosed with ADHD 6 months ago and cleaning and organizing is very hard. At some point, the mess just becomes part of the background, but it is still very distracting and makes me not wanna start working.

How can I arrange this mess?

Any tips or ideas are highly appreciated.

1mqbolo,Possible ADHD?,"Looking for advice—I believe my 17-year-old may have ADHD. He constantly paces, frequently loses things, speaks very fast (often stuttering like his brain is ahead of his speech), and struggles to complete tasks without my direction or oversight. He’s a straight-A student, plays sports, and has many acquaintances, but doesn’t have close friends or hang out with other kids. I think he often feels isolated.
I first raised concerns with his doctor a few years ago, who brushed it off as him being a “ditzy kid.” Later, after pressing again, the doctor suggested we gather teacher feedback. One teacher noted he can be emotional and talks to himself in class; the others gave minimal input. The doctor then referred us to a counselor, which didn’t lead to much progress, my son tends to say what he thinks others want to hear and rarely opens up.
He’s a sweet, kind kid, and I just want to ensure he’s set up to thrive, especially as he heads to college. I plan to revisit this with his doctor, but would be interested in recommendations or next steps, based on personal experiences, that as a parent, I should consider  (e.g., specific evaluations from a specialist, supplement, etc.).",1755202136.0,2,5,ADHD,adhd

So I'm new to my ADHD diagnosis, I got it in Jan this year and I'm still learning/have learnt so much about myself. I get so much motivation to do something but then a bubble sort of pops and I feel like I realise that's not achievable/possible. 

I want to be motivated and driven, I want to work hard in life and carve out a comfortable life for me and my wife, but it seems like I get so far and my brain just stops and I'm left feeling stuck or trapped In a cycle. 

I have a good job in social care and there is no possible way for me to progress without a degree and thats not something I want to do at all. I want to work my way up with the possibility of promotions and more money but I also know my limitations and know I can struggle with burnout and can struggle to have passion for anything.

I've been experiencing severe insomnia while taking various medications for ADHD.

My routine is to take the medication around 6:00 AM, but by midnight, I’m still completely wired. I toss and turn all night and typically only manage about 4 hours of sleep.

As soon as I stop taking the medication, my sleep returns to normal—so it's very clearly connected. I’ve tried different dose levels, but lower doses don’t help my ADHD symptoms, and I’m still wide awake regardless of the dosage. It feels like nothing is working.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Are there any remedies, strategies, or different medication approaches that have worked for others in similar situations?

I program PLCs so when getting an assignment explained to me it was like the code appeared in my head and I could visualize how to do things. 

Well, since this fatigue broke in it is just blank. I can not visualize anything. 

I feel like my head is on super speed. I have like a almost physical buzzing like a headband around my head going round and round.
This buzzing makes me dizzy and it comes and goes throughout the day so it is not constant.

Along with this I just feel fatigue coming and going too. I can sleep short naps several times throughout the day. 

Today I tried mindfullness and focused on guides sessions towards adhd. 
This was bit scary and reliving. But when I did thr mindfullness I could ""re-focus"" the buzzing so instead of around the head it spoiled down so it went from my forehead to my nose instead. 
I was still tired but a chunk of the dizziness disappeared. 


This has been coming and going for some months now and I don't know what to do.
I will keep up the mindfullness of course. But has anyone had anything similar, if so what did you do that helped?

1mq6mfy,Is it possible to get insurance to cover the cost of name brand Adderall?,"I (25F) take Adderall ER 20mg. I have never tried the name brand but I’m considering giving it a shot. It is $223 for a month supply and I’m wondering if I talk with my doctor about side effects of generic brands, if insurance can opt to cover more of the cost. 

I might bite the bullet the first month just so I can try it and make sure it works. There are a couple generic brands that work for me but they’ve consistently dropped off over the years. I’m tired of risking my education and career over having a “bad” manufacturer for a month or two. I have to call around every month to every pharmacy in my area just to try and find the brand that works for me but it seems like they all get the same brand. Right now, I’ve been taking Rhodes and it’s just not doing it. It makes me sleepy, foggy, unmotivated, irritable, and makes it more difficult than it already is to sleep at night. Driving is borderline dangerous on it. Lannett was working for me but it’s nowhere to be seen right now. So I want to just make the switch to name brand to avoid the yo-yo-ing between manufacturers that may or may not work for me. 

I read online that if your doctor requires name brand due to incompatibility with generics, that insurance might opt to cover more of the cost. I have blue cross blue shield and I’m wondering if anyone is able to bring the cost of name brand Adderall to a reasonable price.

1mq64tv,Is this retroactive accommodations or failure to accommodate? What options are there?,"Not sure if I'm in the right place, but any help is appreciated.

***Question:*** *Is scaling a grade according to the* amount of time received *vs* owed *for a test considered retroactive accommodations if the accommodations were in place at the time, and were not honoured? Would the failure to accommodate 'overrule' the 'retroactive' part of retroactive accommodations? Do I have any course of action?*

I'm a university student, and I have approved accommodations for ADHD that lets me write in a small group environment and have 1.25 time. I wrote a midterm where the allotted time was 1 hour, so I received 1 hour & 15 minutes in the disability center. My classmates keep track of exact start and end times due to previous issues with this prof, and they ended up receiving 20 minutes of extra time. My understanding is that accommodations are applied to any time provided for a test, extra time included, so my properly accommodated time should have been 1 hour & 40 minutes.

What comes to my mind would be scaling my grade so that the percentage of time I received is treated as the percentage of the test treated like full marks. So, I scored **67%** in **75%** of the time I was supposed to have. If I treat **75%** as **100%** of the time, then the equivalent grade would be **89.33%**. Would this be considered retroactive accommodations even though I already had accommodations (and is this worthwhile proposing)?

1mpm2p9,I hate living with non-ADHD people,"I (23F) am at college in a different state and I share an apartment with two girls, I have been doing that for a little more than a year and have switched places and “roommates” 1 time (so i lived with 4 different people). My conclusion is I hate it, they are so unbelievably inconsiderate, so much noise all the time, so many people over all the time. I feel like everytime I interact with people with ADHD they are a lot more cool about noise and distractions in a way that non-ADHD people can’t seem to be. 

I have a roommate now that is driving me insane.
I don’t understand why she screams so much on the phone, why she puts such loud music all the time, why she brings people over multiple times a week and I have to be the annoying one always asking her to just turn down the music a little bit. We’re both in college, where both from the same area of the country. I think this is completely about the fact that she doesn’t understand how agonizing it is to have noise in your house at all times. 

Anyway, i’ve already got noise canceling headphones, I take medication and I’m thinking about getting earplugs and wearing one over the other bc I unfortunately can’t afford an apartment by myself.

1mpv800,How do you learn to 'aim' the focus from meds? I keep hyperfocusing on useless stuff,"Hello everyone, I’m 19 and was diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago. I started Quillivant XR two weeks ago and am currently on 15 mg (going up to 20 mg tomorrow per my doc's advice).

When I first went up to 15 mg, I felt a brief, amazing moment of clarity and focus. The problem? Instead of tackling my actual tasks, I got distracted by something completely random and spent the *entire day* hyperfocusing on it, going down a massive internet rabbit hole. I'm pretty sure this is that ""medicated hyperfocus"" I've heard about. The initial feeling of clarity was gone by the next day.

It's so frustrating. I feel like the medication gives me the engine for focus, but I have no idea how to steer the car. I'm tired of my brain running wild and not being able to get myself together for the things that actually matter.

For those of you who've been through this, how did you learn to direct your newfound focus effectively? What are your go-to strategies or habits to make sure the ""focus beam"" shines on your priorities, not on random trivial things?

Any advice would be a huge help. Thank you!",1755161738.0,6,10,ADHD,adhd
1mq2u0a,Revisiting ADHD,"Ive been on Ritalin for maybe 1 solid year. It's really helped me a lot. Before I would do things that really piss people off by accident like; being scatterbrained, doing stuff in random order, waiting to doing stuff til the last minute, etc. 

  
Recently Ive been on an involuntary drug-holiday because my coverage switched and the new one isnt activated yet so I cant get prescriptions at normal prices yet. It's been about 2/3 weeks since I've been off the medication. 

When my new coverage is restored, I will continue to fill the prescriptions for the time being. But my time off the medication has been really interesting. To me I cant really tell when the medication is ""working"" I just feel like i make less mistakes and slow down at work (which is very important for me). The only thing I can notice is the negative side effects. I get really tired exactly 1 hour after taking the medication and it lasts for an hour or so. Also It raises my blood pressure crazy high. I thought I was just a doomed hypertensive. about 4 weeks ago my blood pressure was 144/82 and today its 122/72, so pretty big difference for one month and no other life style changes. I had a resting heart beat of high 90s to low 100s even while laying down. I just felt like a hummingbird about to burst. 

I feel like the longer I take the medication the more benign the positive effects become with the only way to recovering them is upping the dosage (which im sure my poor little heart cant take XD). At least for now I feel like my work performance has been pretty good even while off it but maybe its still in my system long term. I still feel clear, lucid, present, and not confused on a daily basis. 

Im heavily considering going on a 1 every other day regiment or just taking it when I feel like I really need to focus. What are yall's experiences or anecdotes? I feel like the medication is not a long term solution for me even tho its so easy to take the meds (i.e. blood pressure long term)",1755183049.0,2,1,ADHD,adhd
1mq9366,Adults with moderate ADHD using low-dose methylphenidate (5 mg once or twice daily): any experiences?,"I’m an adult with what I would describe as moderate ADHD, and over the years I’ve developed some fairly effective coping mechanisms in daily life: structure, habits, tools, etc. I recently started looking into whether a very low dose of methylphenidate (e.g., Ritalin IR, 5 mg once or twice per day) might be enough to give me a gentle boost without going into the full standard dosing range.

So far, I’ve been digging into the scientific literature, but I’ve found very little research that looks specifically at adults with moderate ADHD who are already compensating reasonably well, and who use small doses like this. Most studies focus on titrating to much higher daily doses, so I’m curious about real-world experiences.

If you:
- Have moderate ADHD diagnosed in adulthood
- Use (or have used) 5 mg IR methylphenidate once or twice daily as your only dose
- And have already put in place good coping strategies before starting medication

…I’d love to hear:
1.	How you decided on such a low dose
2.	What benefits or drawbacks you noticed compared to no medication
3.	Whether you felt it was sustainable in the long term
4.	Any tips for monitoring effects at this dosage

I’m especially interested in cases where this low dose was enough for daily functioning, rather than just a starting point before titrating upward.

Thanks in advance for any insight. I think there’s a real gap in the literature here, so community input could be really valuable.",1755196516.0,1,3,ADHD,adhd

1mq7hhm,Non fasting blood test creatine,"Hi, I took a non fasting blood test and creatine levels were slightly high. They mentioned kindey function, and the first place my mind went to wasn't oh no my kidneys, it was oh no, my Adderall. 

I had a scare with high blood pressure, I miss the days of seeing a psychiatrist and not having to go through all these tests. 

What doctors don't understand, if I go off my meds my health will take a nose dive. I need these meds to function, my life will fall apart without them. 

I spent a long period unmedicated, and it was rough. Even getting the motivation to get back on my meds took a lot effort. 

I may be paranoid, but when my blood pressure was high, it was the aderall not the Lexapro, even though Lexapro causes high blood pressure. 

It was 1.3 creatine on a non fasting blood test.  Which is only slightly high, and non fasting blood tests are not the most accurate way to measure these things. 

I don't even know that's the direction they are going in, but I need my Adderall, especially at this point in my life.

I'm wondering if it's just me, or if this is a trend, has anyone else felt their doctors are making mountains out of mole hills, to try to get you off Adderall? ",1755193150.0,1,4,ADHD,adhd
1mq16uw,High performing at work but my ADHD brain can’t tell when I’ve hurt someone..,"Im a high performer in my career. I hit deadlines, solve problems, deliver results. But there’s one thing my ADHD brain absolutely fails at: recognizing when I’ve accidentally hurt someone’s feelings.

It’s not that I don’t care. I really care. But I can miss the cues completely. Tone changes, micro-expressions, subtle silences. My brain just doesn’t log them in real time. Sometimes I only realize after someone tells me directly, or worse, after damage is already done.

From what I’ve read, this might be tied to ADHD-related cognitive processing challenges, especially difficulty with social-emotional signal recognition. But I don’t see it discussed much, especially among ADHD folks who are otherwise “crushing it” in high-pressure, high-responsibility roles.

If you’re in the same boat, how have you explained this to colleagues or managers without sounding dismissive? Have you ever requested a workplace accommodation for it? What’s actually helped you bridge that gap?

I’m curious if this is a quiet ADHD thing that more of us deal with than we realize.

1mpxknc,Crash on 40mg Vyvanse makes it not worth taking,"As of 1.5 months ago I have been on 20mg Vyvanse which I did not feel too much benefit from. I felt slightly on edge, mood swings, more socially withdrawn. I did feel like I only had one voice going in my head and not a million different thoughts to get me side tracked which was a positive. I also felt like in client meetings I was a lot more attentive and wouldn't interrupt or daydream. If I had my medication at 8:30am, I would feel the effects from 10am - 1pm and would crash from 1pm onwards making work harder then if I wasn't medicated.

Since starting 40mg as of 2 weeks ago I noticed the side effects actually got slightly better, less anxiety, less sweating, more stable happy mood, more productivity and it wasn't overly intense (more like it was running in the background). However, similar to 20mg I would crash from 1:30pm/2pm onwards and I felt tired, fatigued and as if my actual ADHD symptoms were amplified. I would also feel depressed and withdrawn from this time up until bed which makes it more of a disadvantage taking the meds which is a shame as in the 3-4 hour therapeutic window it works well.

I should note my sleep, food, water, magnesium intake etc is all good on Vyvanse as well so it's not that.

Does anyone have some advice on if different medications worked better and/or if a significantly higher dose would be beneficial? I found caffeine to be extremely effective in task initiation however, would be short lived as well with side effects.",1755169754.0,3,13,ADHD,adhd
1mponoh,"My relationship seems to depend on the drug, and it scares me.”","Since I've been with my girlfriend, I've always taken methylphenidate. It's as if the best moments and strongest connection with her have always been tied to when the drug was ""active"" in my body.

When the effect is at its maximum, I feel more open, affectionate and connected with her. But when the drug starts to wear off, I immediately feel a detachment: she hasn't changed, but I feel more distant, less ""present"". It's as if the version of me that she knows and loves is the one ""enhanced"" by methylphenidate, and without that part I struggle to experience the relationship with the same intensity.

The thing that scares me is this: I'm afraid that if one day I developed a tolerance and the drug no longer worked as it does now, I might no longer be able to feel so comfortable with her. I feel like our bond was built through this state of mind and I fear I wouldn't be able to replicate it without it.

I know that the drug doesn't create emotions out of nothing - those are mine - but it amplifies sides of me that, without it, I struggle to bring out. And this realization makes me feel like the happiness in my relationship is fragile, tied to a pill.

Hey, so I just wanted to get people’s experience on Elvanse. When I first started taking it, it was magic honestly my mind has never been clearer. But after about a week of first starting it I had a lot of stressful life shit, I was still ok at this point. Some doses I was more irritable but I changed the dose based on this when it was reviewed. 

My clinician hasn’t been the most supportive - very tick box led and not actually giving me the time to explain the other-stuff going on in my life. I was trying to figure out if the meds didn’t agree with me or if it’s just my life circumstances but he wouldn’t give me the chance to do this. ( I do kinda wonder if some of the low mood shit could’ve been avoided if he would’ve actually listened to my root cause but hey ho, I am getting a new clinician soon)

Anyhow the past few weeks/ maybe even a month now my mental health has completely plummeted. I have been so low and so unmotivated- I’ve constantly felt like this is the new me and how will I ever get over this. I had to take this week off from work for my mental health which is completely rare for me. Yes I suffer with anxiety and depression but this wave of emotions was just so negative for me- I was constantly crying: the evenings were a HUHE trigger for me. 

Luckily in the last few days I feel more stable but I’m really not sure what to do with my meds more, I have been so hyper fixated on my meds and whether they are the right dose. 

So I just wanted to see if anyone else can relate? I’m on 40mg, they want to get me up to 50mg but I just know from previous experience I’m not good on 50. I have seen some people have struggle with mood when on Elvanse and take a lower dose then a top up- so maybe that’s the answer for me.

To top it off, I also put on my noise cancelling headphones and now I’m way more in the zone.

It seems like taking my meds together with my breakfast and coffee counteracts with the meds. This is something my psychiatrist didn’t inform me about. In fact, he said my regular routine shouldn’t give any issues. Also nicotine seems to counteract, making me more ‘sober’.

1mq143s,Is emotional-numbness a common effect of stimulant medication?,"I've started taking meds a few years ago and have been on and off them for a while. They help a lot, but I couldn't help but feel like they made me emotionally numb, even when I've stopped taking them, and I also feel like they have negatively affected my sex drive.

  
I panicked a bit and am now afraid to take the medication again and have been for a while, but life around me is falling apart a bit and I am considering going back on.

  
My doctor told me it's probably not the medication, but I am just worried about permanently messing with my life by taking more of it. I am wondering: has anyone else had the impression that medication made them emotionally numb and killed their sex drive a bit? I'd love to exchange on this topic and hopefully get re-assured on taking meds.

Now, I can't have more than a cup without my heart rate rising, my breath getting shallow, and experiencing anxiety. Still, I could manage it.

I've tried skipping Adderall some days, but it's still in my system, it seems, so I still get anxious. I now use decaf beans, but even with those, I have to make my coffee sparingly. Once every few days.

Skipping days also seems to increase the chance of me getting lightheaded (experiencing this fuzziness/pressure in my forehead. Once, it made me feel like I was gonna pass out while I was driving. It hasn't gotten that severe since then, though.)

Sooo, am I just screwed? Maybe using a nonstimulant would allow me to have caffeinated drinks, but making sure my medication fulfills my needs is more important.

A while ago, I got ""diagnosed"" by a telehealth psychiatrist, but because of the policy of the group they worked with, they weren't allowed to prescribe stimulants without jumping through some hoops and referrals. Instead, they put me on a low dose of Bupropion, hasn't seemed to do anything. I haven't seen them again because my insurance changed the calls got expensive, but also because I just got discouraged and stopped trying.

My sister's struggles with ADHD almost exactly mirror mine right now, and her life has never been better than after she got diagnosed and put on Adderall some years ago. And that convinced me that it could change my life too.

Getting past this canyon feels like the single most important thing in the world for me right now, but as much as I believe that, I just can't for some reason. There's a perfect storm of the usual suspects:

* I forget entirely. (Like how I forget to eat/drink water until it physically hurts)
* I remember. I Say ""I'll do that after I do X"", then I forget.
* There being more than 1 step makes it feel like a thousand steps.
* I know what I need to do, but there's a mental-wall that I can't explain.
* I get sidetracked as I'm looking for doctors, and now unintentionally I'm doing something else.
* I'm feeling down/discouraged about all-of-the-above, which just makes it harder to do anything.
* And more...

I don't know what to do. I can't keep living like this, but I also cant seem to do anything to change it. Seeing that first psychiatrist took me like an entire year of mustering the willpower and waiting for my brain to roll nat20s in memory, train-of-thought, and executive function in a row.

So last year I've been having the thought of seeking information about what I was struggling and tbh, It feels like it is ADHD, but I can't seem to accept it

Poor concentration, extreme time blindness, a struggle with order (especially with my room), procrastinating at everything, can't sit still  even while trying to sleep.

But now is just too much, is sooooo annoying to me and to everyone else in my life, is so frustrating that when people say ""just do it, is not that difficult"" ""is not like you can't do it""

I do try, I have daily reminders, alarms, I tried SOO hard to do a weekly schedule and more but anything helps, the alarm sounds and Im like ""ok I have to do this"" and literally forget a second after

A bit about me (trying to keep below 2000 characters):

M(40), German, 2 kids, happily married, fairly successful professionally. Slowly stumbled into an alcohol addiction by using alcohol to deal with boredom in my job or to cope with feelings of guilt over messes I made that never seemed to happen to other people in my life. Decided to go into rehab and now sober for some time and very stable. Diagnosed with ADHD and high giftedness during rehab and happy to finally have an explanation for many things as well as using 20mg Methylphenidate per day to help my focus.

For me the ADHD diagnosis (+ diagnosis for high giftedness) as well as medication was a cornerstone to deal with the alcohol addiction I had stumbled into and it feels like it was the right step to look at the whole iceberg that was below the addiction.

Got assessed, results were inconclusive. Psychiatrist thinks ADHD explains my burnout cycles, but meds haven’t helped. Still unsure if it’s really ADHD. Anyone else need multiple assessments to confirm?

I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety throughout adulthood. My sister, who’s an occupational therapist, noticed traits that seemed consistent with ADHD and encouraged me to get tested.

I saw a neuropsychologist (I’m in Canada, where they often handle these assessments), and after a full battery of tests, they found weaknesses in executive and attentional functioning. However, because there wasn’t clear evidence of childhood impairment, they labeled it “subclinical ADHD.”

In parallel, I was referred to a psychiatrist due to recurring depressive and anxious episodes. When reviewing the neuropsych assessment, she suggested ADHD could explain my fluctuating functioning—overcompensating, burning out, then crashing into depression. She kept ADHD as a working diagnosis.

We’ve tried several medications, both stimulant and non-stimulant, but none have helped. I’ve also done therapy, though not all providers take ADHD seriously, which adds to the confusion.

I’ve always struggled to keep up with work and home life, and I’m feeling lost/discouraged. Has anyone else needed multiple assessments before getting a clear diagnosis? At this point, I don't care what the diagnosis is. I just want support that will provide stability. ",1755137029.0,5,5,ADHD,adhd

I'm 42 and I've just been diagnosed with ADHD. My Dr started me on Atomoxetine because she would not put me on a stimulant until I had quit my natural alternative medicine (The green stuff) for at least 2 weeks. That two week mark is up on Sunday and on Monday I start taking Dexamfetamine sulfate combined with the Atomoxetine. I think the end goal is to keep me on Atomoxetine and after Dex proves to work, move me onto Vyvanse.

I have looked through many posts on here but I am yet to find anyone on this combination of meds, so if anyone is, please speak up and let me know how it is working for you? I am pretty excited to start on my stimulates because I have read loads of positive posts about how its helped change lives etc..

I am pretty successful in business, I am married with two kids (11) and (9) but since my diagnoses I have noticed some ADHD traits which I would like to get under control, once major one is noise and how it triggers me, puts me in a bad mood and my emotions start to spiral.

The reason for the dex is because its short acting and she said that she doesn't want to put me on Vyvanse immediately because if it does make anxious, she doesn't want me to be stuck in that state for the long period.

The meds that I will be on from Monday are the following:

Atomoxetine - 100mg's per day - I am on that amount right now,

Dexamfetamine - Days 1-4: ONE tab after breakfast, Days 5-12: ONE tab after breakfast + ONE tab after lunch, Day 13 onwards: TWO tabs after breakfast + ONE tab after lunch

I would also like to know if there is anything I should expect to feel on day 1 or be worried about? I am asking because since I went up to 100mg on Atomoxetine, I feel when the tablet is starting to work (around 30 / 45 mins after taking it in the morn), I start to feel funny, which sometimes I do not enjoy, but this feeling does pass pretty quickly.

I feel like the insomnia for me is just a byproduct of the meds wearing off rather than being on them.

If I do it at least 4-5 out of 7 days, I count that as a success and allow myself to add one more activity next week. If I miss an activity - or several - I’ll reduce the number to focus on what matters.

Rules:

* Activities start tiny: 'read one page', 'put dishes in the dishwasher' etc.
* If I miss one, I won’t shame myself - I’ll ask: Why am I doing this? I’ll write a short answer and archive the activity to review later.
* Every week I answer that 'why?' for each activity I did or didn’t do, then review the archive when life is easier.

This feels better because 1 activity per week shouldn't be hard. If I miss a week I can rest and try again later if the 'Why?' is strong. Reflection gives weekly data to figure out what fits my life instead of what looks 'good' in mainstream society. Finally, it might help me keep balance and avoid burning out.

Curious for the crowd:

* Has anyone tried something similar - one tiny thing for a week, then add one if it mostly sticks? How did it go?
* What would make this approach better?
* Roast the idea if it doesn’t make any sense or just sounds like another desperate attempt to change my life - I want blunt takes, cause it will save soooo much time for me.

If you have tricks that help a tiny activity happen consistently, I want those. I just want something that doesn’t feel like failure every Monday. DM if interested in my progress.

1mpixzb,I don't want to eat anymore even though I'm hungry,"So I've been diagnosed with adhd very recently so I'm still figuring a lot of thjngs out but since I'm in exam period in college I am taking meds which do help me focus. However past couple weeks I'm struggling more and more with eating. In the beginning I was still able to eat my comfort foods like fries and pizza (I know not healthy but I was happy I ate something at least) but past 2weeks nothing seems good anymore. I tried to eat my meal prep as it requires no effort but 2 bites and I can't get myself to eat any more I also tried yogurt becauseI saw someone recommended that as an easy food but same thing happened. Thinking about my comfort foods or any food just makes me extremely nauseous and disgusted but at the same time my stomach is litteraly screaming at me to eat something. I lost 7kg in the past 2 or 3 weeks and I was already thin to begin with so I'm getting worried I'll lose too much weight if I don't eat soon.

Anyone who had similar issues or tips on foods I can try? I can't go to my doctor currently and if I stop my meds I'll fail my exams for sure so I can't do that either.",1755124535.0,6,3,ADHD,adhd
1mp5nws,I really can't stand managers who don't understand ADHD and see it as only a weakness that needs to be forcefully changed,"I have been told I'm really good at my job as far as the actual technical skill and communication goes. It seems like whenever I work with other engineers, everything is great. However, my last few bosses have so severely misunderstood my ADHD and constantly see it as a ""problem"" to be ""fixed""

I had a 1:1 with my manager and one word kept coming up: **distractible**. She has this opinion because, to her, ""correct"" working means following an extremely discrete and defined set of steps in the correct order. To me, my thought process is more like a scatter bomb than a precision missile. Sure, this has its drawbacks, but does it not have some benefits?

The other day, someone reported a **critical** bug. All good, I got it. My manager quickly hopped in and criticized me, quite literally, *every* step of the way. ""okay let me take a look and see what's going on"", then she'll chime in with ""make a ticket first"". Okay fine you're right. Then she'll be like ""format the ticket title exactly like I do""... okay, I didn't know that was a rule now, but sure. ""Format the description in this very particular way that I just made up""... sure... yeah... okay, but is this ticket **urgent** or not? I don't really even know what the cause is, why am I writing up what the description is before that? I'd simply do this a bit differently

She left a pretty scathing review saying I seem kind of stupid for not being able to do the exact process step by step in exact order. I asked why it was particularly important that it be in that order, and she said ""that's just the way it is"". I asked if it was from some formal definition, and she said no, it should come naturally to anyone who is ""a good engineer""

It's hard to reconcile this against the fact that most people say I'm quite skilled technically, have \~12 years experience, but she often calls me a ""junior engineer"" derisively (even though my title is ""senior engineer"", so it's just kinda insulting)",1755094509.0,27,27,ADHD,adhd

The issue is, when the pressure builds up, I tend to seek instant gratification, ike scrolling social media or other impulsive distractions (like corn) even though I know it won’t help. I already deleted TikTok today, which I’m proud of. But I still get those waves of urges, not really out of boredom, more like an escape from the pressure.

I’m deeply in debt, with bills 2-3 months overdue, and at risk of losing my house. My utilities are shut off at least every three months before I borrow money to restore power.

For the past two years, I’ve been prescribed ineffective medications while my psychiatrists insist that another non-stimulant will work, despite their opposition to ADHD meds. I’m constantly given depression medications, yet I complain to my psychiatrist and therapist that my executive dysfunction is the main cause of my depression.

I’m at a loss for what to do. I have a family I can barely support, and my deteriorating mental health is affecting my partner. I’ve created a cycle of “give up and do it later” that I can’t escape, and I’m tired of hearing dismissive responses to my struggles from people who seem to manage life more easily.

Past trauma adds to my mental and emotional issues. As a veteran, I’m fighting with the VA for compensation, and I fear that by the time I receive relief, I might have already become another statistic.

My daughter is 9.5 years old. She was dx at age 6 with ADHD, and last year anxiety was added to her diagnosis.

She is so smart, funny, talented, but perceives herself in such a negative way. She constantly says she has no friends, she hates school, she doesn’t like anything. However, she does have friends. She is invited to birthday parties. She goes on play dates. I’ve observed she is very drawn to kids who are not nice or scandalous in some way and spends a ton of time trying to win them over. She describes kind kids who we spend time with as “boring.”

I want to know the best way to support her so she grows up with a solid self-esteem and a supportive peer group. She takes medication, sees a therapist, has a 504 at school, is involved in extra curriculars, so there are already a lot of pieces in place, but she expresses a ton of concern and upset regarding peer relations.

But basically I was super high achieving in HS, like 7th out of 330 students, multiple AP classes, president of 3-4 clubs. THEN I transitioned into college and I failed 3-4 classes, couldn’t focus on anything and had to be out of my room to actually get work done (I was ALSO a college freshman in 2020 which just made it all way more difficult) and I ended up failing/withdrawing from a lot of classes that year but still managed to have a 3.0 to keep scholarships. I graduated on time and then I started grad school and I had such a hard time, I ended up withdrawing completely. Which is what spurred me to get a diagnosis bc it was just so NOT like me ??

1mp3fhl,My ADHD meds changed my life… but now they’re destroying my body,"Hi everyone,

I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD about a year and 8 months ago. When I first started Medikinet, it felt like someone had finally turned the lights on in my brain. I went from being the kind of student who gave up on school my whole life, to enrolling in university and even getting multiple top grades. I went from spending most of my day in bed to having an active, fulfilling routine. It honestly felt like I was finally me.

But 8 months ago, everything shifted. I moved back to my home country, and a lot happened — toxic relationships, losing a family member, other difficult personal things. At the same time, I found my dream job, which I’m truly grateful for.

Here’s where the problem is: in these 8 months, I’ve lost 15 kg without even trying. I barely eat, my sleep is a mess, my heart often races, my sex drive has completely disappeared, and I just feel like my body is running on fumes. On top of that, the medication has given me intense cravings to smoke — I had quit smoking before, but now I smoke a lot again.

Everyone around me thinks I have anorexia because they see me never eating. I’ve explained to my psychiatrist many times that I don’t eat because I have zero appetite, not because I want to lose weight (though I can’t deny I do feel better about my body now).

1mpb6ds,Questions about criteria for ADHD,"I am very confused about the criteria to be diagnosed with ADHD. I have lots of conflicting information and experiences regarding it.

I am a 52 year old female. I did not show any signs of ADHD until I was in my mid 40's. I went to get tested for ADHD. His way of testing was just to talk to me for 1 hour and then he had me click a button on a machine every time I heard a sound or saw a flashing light. He concluded that I did not have ADHD and didn't know what my problem was. About 4 or 5 years later I was diagnosed with Autism and the diagnostician wanted to test me for ADHD too because he believed that I had that, as well. Long story short, we did not test for it (I can explain why if anybody really needs to know but it's not that important for the point of my post).

These are the traits/symptoms that I have:

\- I daydream a lot (this is actually the only one I've had since childhood)

\- My memory is horrible

\- I fidget constantly (even when I'm falling asleep)

\- I usually don't finish what I start

\- Extremely easily distracted, even in the middle of cooking dinner (I'll completely forget I started it because I got sidetracked)

\- I impulse shop all the time

\- I interrupt people a lot

\- I can't focus on most things longer than a few minutes, on average

\- I am compelled to multitask but then I get agitated and stressed out

So basically my questions are, how can one diagnostician think I don't have it and another one think I do? And, how can I have all of these symptoms now but I didn't until I was in my mid 40s?",1755106926.0,5,8,ADHD,adhd

I’ve been searching but I feel like I’m getting confused  if they’re just treating kids & unmotivated that they may dismiss me as an adult. Idc if it’s in person or tele-health. Ty❤️


Background for more info if u guys can chime in if I should get an eval or not:

Never knew much ab ADHD, got offered adderall by a friend once at 20. It allowed me to focus and digest info, and actually enjoy the information too, and made me feel like wow if I used this.. I could be doing so much better in life…. But i felt like maybe that’s just what drugs do, and maybe I should stay away from it. Also, these people who have an rx were diagnosed at a young age, I obviously wasn’t so maybe I don’t have it. I never even go to the dr in general, I don’t even have a PCP. 

An ADHD article recently fell on my lap telling me symptoms I never knew were ADHD. Now I’m here cuz I feel like maybe I could be treated and live a way better organized life than the one I have now.

These r my “symptoms”

- got in trouble a lot as a kid in school for being overly talkative/ every teacher telling my parents I talk way too much

- blurting out 

- done every assignment/exam/project the night before stressing myself out

-I went to college + doctorate but never managed to pull anything higher than a B average due to inconsistency, but always highstandardized test scores

- always late to everything in my life (including work)

- friends + fam constantly remind me of events/times

-obviously don’t have consistent motivation 

-  miss 1/2 of what ppl say

- but I also finish ppl sentences a lot

- incapable of having a schedule 

 -partner upset w me that I’m really bad with money 

BUT but I don’t have the symptoms of 

-inability to sit still. 
- clutter/messiness : I keep my environment super clean , having clutter or things on the floor/desk bothers me",1755137038.0,1,1,ADHD,adhd

But the sleepy effect makes me feel like I need to go take a nap and it lasts all day and it is having the opposite effect on my focus at work.  I talked to my Dr and they suggested increasing the dose to see if it helps, which seems counterintuitive, but I'm willing to try it.  

The pharmacy didn't have the focalin in the increased dose and the Dr ended up prescribing Adderall XR 25mg instead.  I am wondering though, if the focalin makes me sleepy, will it happen with all the stimulants or will Adderall potentially be completely different?

1mpmvl4,Curious if others’ CBT sessions felt repetitive at first,"Hey everyone,

I’m 26(f) and 6 sessions in with my new therapist. The focus has been CBT and maybe some somatic elements, and I suspect EMDR could come later, but right now it’s all CBT-focused.

For context, I have PTSD, ADHD (inattentive type), and GAD, and I am very confident I also have OCD, though it’s not officially diagnosed. Most of my anxiety stems from people saying I’m “slow,” which is true. My neuropsych evaluation showed my processing speed is slower than 90 percent of people my age. I think this is accurate because I know it, and everyone else notices it too. I have always struggled with exams, but I still felt smart in a way because I am naturally curious. However, people noticing my slower processing over the years has contributed to low self-esteem and rejection sensitivity. My GAI index score from that evaluation was 6, which was statistically significant, though I know one evaluation isn’t conclusive.

Early sessions ended with short meditations, which stopped recently. I also notice repetitive patterns like being asked “How did that make you feel?” or “Is it a thought or a fact?” a lot, and questions like “When have you trusted yourself?” that I often have nothing to say to. Almost every response starts with “It sounds like you’re feeling,” which sometimes feels robotic. Small thing: she sometimes yawns while I talk, though she still listens.

This is my third therapist. First was talk therapy, second was CBT on campus but too stoic. This one is nice, but I’m curious if others felt similar in early CBT sessions. It’s a weekly, $30 session, and I live in NYC, so I notice the value I get.

Has anyone else experienced early CBT sessions feeling repetitive or reflective without much progress?

Thing is I’m pretty good at adapting to new things, I love to learn, I thrive in chaos and apparently I’m ok good at what I do as well at least I got promoted regularly or jumped companies for better positions. 

But I don’t want to do it anymore. The toll is just too high and in the current economy jobs are hard to come by anyways so I’m expecting to have to accept even more compromises just to get one. 

But I don’t know what else to do. The creative field is cooked and was for a long time, and current technical advances will make it even worse.

Too much just makes my brain go ""nooo! baby see ***more*** bad stepsies! baby not care if step little! too many little step still too hawd!  waaahhh!!!!""

I feel like the only thing that semi-reliably works besides relying on random chance is to literally do absolutely ***nothing*** for a good while.

1mpblsh,ADHD diagnosis with Bupa?,"I (f,30) have recently decided to take the plunge in getting a diagnosis possibly through Bupa, over the past 3 years of doing a uni degree all the procrastination and overwhelming breakdowns I had back as a teen at school came flooding back. I was beginning to think ""maybe it wasn't just a phase of teen anxiety, because adult me is still doing this"", this was just the first step in realising there might be something there, alongside the emotional disregulation, the hyper focusing on tidying and tasks that once my husband tried to interrupt I would get easily agitated and stressed (over what seemed trivial), the knowing I needed to do stuff but putting it off anyway and then beating myself up about it etc. amongst the little things like occasional echolalia in convo, nail biting and skin picking and leg jiggles. All of which I thought was entirely normal! But due to some personal struggles the anxiety of it all is becoming seriously detrimental on my mental health and I'm not sure how to even go about getting a diagnosis.
So, if you've read this far how would I go about this? 
Side note; I have an appointment with the GP for the anxiety side of things because it's really affecting me and I can't sit on an NHS waiting list, but I would like to get a proper diagnosis on the ADHD front.

1mpbi2w,"Getting back to studying, need help/tips","Totally failed high school, somehow managed to get my grades later and took a bachelors degree about ten years ago.

Got diagnosed two years ago.

Now Im going back to school to study a totally different area, one that Im interested in. But studying scared the living hell out of me.

I have absolutely no system. I used to take verbatim notes of what the lecturer said on my laptop. It was that or zoning out completely. I never ever read the notes later. I just dumped them in different subject folders and titled them with the date of the day. Then I used my somewhat ok recollection, my general knowledge and my decent vocabulary (in my native tongue) to write papers in the last possible moment. Oftentimes staying up all night to turn in it, sometimes a bit tipsy. A complete mess. But I got through it. How I managed to write my final thesis I dont know. 

I always tried to get organized through different means. Right now google calendar and keep is the base. 

I tried the original bullet journal method, but I end up ditching it due to the cost of maintaining it. And it not being synced with other things. The phone on the other hand has all the distractions, so there's that.

I've always idealised having a Grand Unified System of Everything. Oftentimes in my mind including obsidian, cross sync, setting up my own raspberry pi sync server.. lol, as if...

What Im looking to do now is getting a laptop, I dont own one anymore. And using it for taking notes. I have an idea of using obsidian because I feel it could be beneficial to be able to link different concepts. But I am also fairly sure the cost of setting it up and maintaining it will be too high, or I will just forget it.

Im stuck in analysis paralysis regarding what system to use. All the systems I have in mind needs me to not have adhd to work.

I've taken SSRIs along side vyvanse for a few years but only recently gone on paroxetine and the anxiety is beyond crazy. I'm only 2 weeks in with paroxetine but when l looked this up online apparently paroxetine as the most potent inhibitory effect on the CYP2D6 enzyme. This strong inhibitory effect can lead to drug interactions with other medications metabolized by CYP2D6. 
It says Combining paroxetine and Vyvanse can increase the risk of side effects of both drugs with Paroxetine being the most likely. 
Wondering if anyone else takes these 2 drugs together and what your experience has been? I know everyone is different and know there's a major risk with all SSRIs with vyvanse but like l say, I've been fine on other SSRIs and vyvanse. I'm wondering if it's just initial side effects from the paroxetine. Any advice would be greatly appreciated ❤️",1755117888.0,1,1,ADHD,adhd

My permanent address is in NC, but I have a temporary contract position in VA.  My adderall can’t be prescribed over state lines, so I was going to find a new doctor in VA.

My insurance told me if I go to a VA doctor and pharmacy, the pharmacy would see that my address is in NC and refuse to fill it. They said they can only use the address given by my employer, so my employer would have to change my address from NC to VA.

My permanent address/residency can’t be changed with my employer due to tax reasons. I own a home in NC and this is just a temporary position 1-2 years max.

Does anyone have experience in this situation?? This seems ridiculous since there are tons of people that live in different states than their permanent address... so I’m not understanding why they don’t have a solution…

The lost keys, the unpaid bills, the work phone I’ve left at home again. The pure rage I feel standing in a grocery queue or at a red light. The endless hobby carousel, like I pick one, get decent at it, drop it cold turkey, repeat. The half-finished projects. The awkward pauses mid-conversation because my brain just… wandered off. The daily life admin I’ve been leaning on my parents or girlfriends to handle.

Now I’m on Ritalin and it’s a game-changer for focusing at work. But holy hell, the start-up phase is rough (nausea, spinning head, wanting to throw up. Am i the only one having this?) Then once it kicks in? Amazing. Until it wears off and suddenly it’s like someone vacuumed out my soul.

When neighbors talk to me, I often get stuck in this situation where I end up dragging the conversation too long. Stopping and just walking away feels awkward, so I keep talking and try to find the “right” topic to wrap things up. I know it sounds silly, but I really struggle with it.

Example:

They see me about to go into my house.

Neighbor: Hi, where did you go?

Me: Hi, I just came back from the hospital. I haven’t seen you for a while, did you just get back from work? How’s work?

Neighbor: (tells me about their work)

1mp87ys,Thoughts on Glenmark,"Okay, first of all, I know everyone is different, so this all just my two cents on how Glenmark is working for me personally. Please keep in mind that the same may not be true for you.

My normal generic adderall (30mg IR from Teva) has been on back order for a while at my pharmacy (Walgreens, Wake county, NC) and my options were mallonckrodt (👎🏼) or glenmark, which I’ve never heard of. I decided to go with Glenmark, since we all know how horrible mallinckrodt is (personally, it gives me jitters, tension headaches, and no cognitive help). I tried to find some info about Glenmark before saying yes to it, and only came across a couple posts on here that made me think it might be okay, so I went with it. I thought I’d let y’all know what I think about it too, in case someone else is looking for info.

First of all, it’s the same color orange as teva, which was a nice surprise. I know color doesn’t actually mean anything, but there’s totally a placebo effect of color that makes me feel more confident in it. It also tastes similar to Teva. Not quite as sweet, but not bad or very chalky either. I only took it about two hours ago, but so far I’m feeling good. The potency feels right, and it feels less edgy than Teva. It also seemed to kick in more subtly and a little smoother than Teva. My heart rate feels up a bit, but it isn’t racing, and I also just drank some coffee, so that could be why. So far, it seems to be working really well for me, and I feel very balanced. I feel very clear headed and honestly my ability to focus seems more like it was when I took Vyvanse, but it doesn’t seem so Vyvanse-y (definitely more adderall-y) at the same time… I don’t know how to explain that, but it’s a good thing…

At this point, it seems like it’s a good (maybe better?) alternative for me. I will update later and let y’all know if anything changes for better or worse for me!",1755100394.0,2,1,ADHD,adhd
1mprawd,My psychiatrist dumped me,"TL;DR Disagreed with the shrink got bounced.

I was diagnosed late in life (almost 50) as the result of seeking therapy during a rough divorce.  At the time I was drinking 2 40oz Steel Reserve a day to manage my anxiety and racing mind.  But, once I got Vyvanse that all changed.  A year after the divorce I met a woman in Colombia and moved there (now my wife for 4 years) and in that time got drunk once and only drank occasionally.  While in Colombia it was impossible to get Vyvanse so I coped without because I had this amazing woman to occupy my time and attention.  I'm currently back in the US for work and separated from my wife due to immigration being _so slow_.  The anxiety/depression of missing her has caused me to justify drinking again and after a couple months I realized what I was doing and decided to go back to my psychiatrist.  I told her what's going on and she says she wants me to go to AA, prescribed a urinalysis, and a follow-up in 10 days.  Today was that follow-up.  I open with, ""I've thought a lot about your request and I just didn't see it.  I'm not interested in AA because I'm not an alcoholic. I'm self medicating.  There's a difference.  If I were an alcoholic how did I quit cold turkey for over 3 years in Colombia?"" Her response? ""I'm not comfortable prescribing you Vyvanse.  I'll give you the ADHD test diagnosis and the notes from our last session and you can find another psychiatrist.""   No explanation.  End of session. This is so many layers of messed up I'm still processing.  Just thought I'd vent here to see if anyone had some advice.

1moyx1z,A positive doc experience !!,"I wanted to share a good-news story, because I know so many posts here are about frustrating doctors and long waits.

I was diagnosed privately around 5 years ago whilst at uni. For about 2 years, I had a shared-care agreement: the NHS issued my prescriptions at the standard £9/month, but I still had to see my private psychiatrist every 6 months (£200+ for a 5-minute “How’s it going?” appointment).

Eventually I asked my GP about doing a full care transfer to the NHS. With ADHD meds in the UK, you have to leave your private psychiatrist first before the NHS will take over completely which stressed me about losing access to medication in the gap.

But that didn’t happen. My GP just kept issuing my repeat prescription ?

I didn’t want to rock the boat, so even though I needed to change meds, I stayed quiet for a year or two. 

I eventually went in because of side effects and asked to change meds (switching from Elvanse long-acting to two short-acting capsules), my GP said it was fine bc I wasn’t asking for an increase in dosage. 

He then said “ADHD is a lifetime condition. We are here to help you manage it.”

After all the negative stories I’d read online about struggles with changing docs, it was so reassuring to hear that.

3 months later, I went back to ask for my old meds + some short acting and my GP made the change immediately (even though it was an increase) and told me to just have a phone call appt next time instead of coming in. 

Honestly, I just wanted to share that sometimes it can go smoothly, and there are supportive GPs out there who get it.

Disclaimer: I’m not sure if this is something all GPs can do, but it may be worth checking with yours

When I started XR I started at 10mg, and am currently on 25 mg. 

I more recently also started on an SSRI (may not be related but figured id add it in). For the 1-2 months after I started the SSRI my wife also started waking me up and feeding me my meds in the morning when she leaves for work.

Fast forward to the last 30 days and Im just dead, starting to slip back to old sleep routines, and finding no motivation to do anything.

For years I have been in constant physical pain, anxiety, school became so hard that I ended up dropping out of college my second semester, and as time reached the past 3 months the same had begun to occur at work.

I broke down a week ago and went to the doctor to discuss medications, I took it yesterday morning before work then went on my way. The Adderall kicked in on my drive to work and I almost cried. For 8 hours, for the first time in nearly a decade, my mind was docile. No anxiety, no physical pain, my heart rate went down, I had energy, my brain just focused on my work. Without everything else weighing my mind and body down I was able to function normally. It made me reflect and think “have I really just been raw dogging suffering for a decade?”

ADHD has never been a huge facet of my everyday, it wasn’t something I was concerned about till 18 and had only been discussed amongst close friends who are also diagnosed…birds of a feather aye? But after conversations with people in their 30’s and 50’s who also deal with this I’ve come to be able to manage it. The medication has improved my quality of life but I also have an appreciation for being able to focus on 50 different things at the same time.

1mp7oqp,dealing with burnout at work,"i was diagnosed with ADHD around Dec 2023 but had thought for a long time before then that i had it. my symptoms are the most challenging with work tasks - focus, motivation to get things done, etc.

i've been at my job for a little over 3 yrs, and i've been trying on and off to get a new job essentially the whole time, but it's very difficult to find suitable and fairly paid positions in my industry. i've gone through periods where the issues at my workplace have improved somewhat, so i would be more casually keeping an eye out than actively looking for jobs, but i've reached a breaking point (both emotionally and financially) and am actively looking for something new. i'm actually trying to change fields entirely at this point.

my question is, how do i deal with my symptoms while still stuck in a job i hate? (quitting without a new job lined up is not an option) i already have trouble motivating myself to get started on tasks and focusing on my work, and the way i feel about my workplace/the burnout just make it SO much harder. the nature of my role means i have near-constant deadlines, have to juggle a lot of small tasks along with long-term projects, and nearly all projects involve talking to people outside of the company, so it's not like i can just rely on the impending deadline adrenaline to get me to power through something quickly if i procrastinate too long. 

i realized recently that while i may have thought i knew how to deal with my symptoms (why did i think that??) i don't really have coping mechanisms or know what works best for me. i'll put on music that helps me focus, keep a detailed planner/calendar, or set a pomodoro timer, and those help sometimes, but aren't things i can rely on 24/7. (i am on adderall plus wellbutrin and lexapro for anxiety/depression, which definitely helps, but doesn't solve everything)

1mp7291,Glenmark review,"My normal generic adderall (30mg IR from Teva) has been on back order for a while at my pharmacy (Walgreens, Wake county, NC) and my options were mallonckrodt (👎🏼) or glenmark, which I’ve never heard of. I decided to go with Glenmark, since we all know how horrible mallinckrodt is (personally, it gives me jitters, tension headaches, and no cognitive help). I tried to find some info about Glenmark before saying yes to it, and only came across a couple posts on here that made me think it might be okay, so I went with it. I thought I’d let y’all know what I think about it too, in case someone else is looking for info. 

First of all, it’s the same color orange as teva, which was a nice surprise. I know color doesn’t actually mean anything, but there’s totally a placebo effect of color that makes me feel more confident in it. It also tastes similar to Teva. Not quite as sweet, but not bad or very chalky either. I only took it about an hour ago, but so far I’m feeling good. The potency feels right, and it feels less edgy than Teva. It also seemed to kick in more subtly and a little smoother than Teva. My heart rate feels up a bit, but it isn’t racing, and I also just drank some coffee, so that could be why. So far, it seems to be working really well for me, and I feel very balanced. 

At this point, I recommend it as a good (maybe great?) alternative, for those of you who prefer Teva. I will update later and let y’all know if anything changes, how long it lasts, if there’s a crash, and how day two goes!",1755097747.0,1,1,ADHD,adhd

We were never flirty with each other because at that time I also had a girlfriend but was in the process of breaking up. We spent a total of one month just hanging out with other people as well but got along really well. Then after that she went on vacation and is planning to travel for two months visiting different places in Europe.

I texted her about three weeks ago asking her if she wanted to go out with me but she hasn’t replied since then.

She has wished me happy birthday recently in a different social media app and I replied to that message but she disappeared again without replying back.

I’m not sure what’s going on but either she avoids me or my messages flew completely over her head?

I don’t know what kind of ADHD she has but she is someone who avoids confrontation.

She will be back from vacation in about 3 weeks from now. Should I text her again when she is back or wait for a potential message back from her? I was even thinking of giving her a call and ask her out again that way.

Pretty much any time a fight scene or prolonged narration happened with no dialog my mind just goes deaf to what was going on and I miss a ton of stuff. I used to just accept that I would miss stuff but it got annoying not knowing what the enviroment the scene was in or how I'm supposed to imagine room like if it's a office, street, slum, etc or I would somtimes just miss narrative context to what was happening in the moment.

Some things I've tried that I would say have helped somewhat is speeding up the audio although I'm a bit hesitant to go to high speeds because then I worry a bit if it will kill the mood because of awkward noticeable fast talking. Another thing is somtimes I'll just repeat what is being said out loud and maybe at times dramaticize it to add some fun to it but even then my mind can still wander while I'm repeating the words. Somthing I gave up on was finding suitable ambient background music for the scene but when I did do that I did find it help a bit but just became tedious. Curious if anyone else had any tricks.

I called around to other CVSs in the area and found out it’s on back order a lot of places, but I managed to find one that had just 20 pills.

A few hours after picking up my prescription from that CVS, I got a text saying my prescription was ready for pickup at my usual CVS. I called and confirmed and they do have it, all 30 pills, and somehow the system didn’t flag it or void it. Now I’m not sure what I want to do.

I wish I hadn’t picked up to 20 pills and instead gave my original pharmacy a chance, but I panicked when I heard “backorder”.

I’m a monogamous guy and just looking for a genuine long term relationship so I’ve never used the apps like Grindr etc - I got through the hookup phase in my early 20’s and have no interest in that anymore.

Around a month ago I had a “fuck it” moment and made a dating profile on Hinge. At first it was tiring - the amount of people who are unable to hold even the most basic of conversations was exhausting, but eventually I started talking to a guy who I share a lot in common with. 

We’ve been on 3 long and great dates, but he wants to “take it slow”, which seems to be at a snail pace (apparently he had a bad experience “rushing” in the past). Despite the dates being very good, when we return to texting in between, he seems colder and I struggle with the hot/cold dynamic. 

My question is, how do I avoid the chronic over-thinking, over-analysing and general minefield of mindfuck that this early dating stage entails? He’s a lot more closed than I am (I’m very open about everything) which is just causing me to feel quite shitty.

1mogkpr,Paralyzed with ADHD,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 34-year-old gay man who’s struggled to function for most of my life. I was a happy, energetic kid, but I was also made fun of a lot — probably because of my high-pitched voice, mannerisms, and just being “different.” I didn’t fully realize my sexuality until high school, but by then my mental health had already started to decline, and that continued into college.

For years I thought my challenges were just anxiety and depression (which I do have), and I tried countless medications without much success. Recently, I’ve started to suspect ADHD may be a big part of it — something I never considered before. I was also a heavy drinker until July 2024, when I finally quit. Sobriety has brought some positives — no more blackouts or risky behavior, and less anxiety — but it’s also forced me to face emotions I used to bury with alcohol, which has been tough.

Financially, I’m in a rough spot. I work in real estate, but with the market down and my motivation low, it’s been hard to keep things going. I often feel tired but restless, and paralyzed when it comes to getting things done. I’ve been doing Uber Eats and DoorDash while looking for something else, but the actual job search always seems to stall. I also struggle with binge eating and the guilt that follows.

I wanted to see a psychiatrist, but my insurance didn’t cover mental health. I eventually cancelled the policy altogether since it wasn’t great anyway, but that’s left me without a clear path to professional help.

I’m not sure what I want from this post except to know I’m not alone — maybe to hear from people who’ve been through something similar and found a way forward. I know life can feel impossible, but I’m holding onto the hope that things can change with the right steps, even if I don’t know exactly what those are yet.

I'll keep it very short, there are two main insights that I discovered about this type of brain -

1. You aren't distracted, you are focused. When you can't do XYZ, you are hyper-focused on ABC. You may not even be aware of what that ABC is, but hyper-focus is not a symptom of ADHD - hyper-focus IS ADHD.
2. If you can repeat your concerns - which can be very hard to train yourself to do because you'll always be hyper-focused on ABC - you'll fix ADHD. Don't brush, don't work, don't do anything else - just list everything down. Then repeat. Then repeat. Then repeat. Then repeat. For normal people ""the list of concerns"" is intrusive no matter what they are focused on, for ADHD brain these reminders are absent. You have to wake the list/reminders up by training.

1mow8j1,Premedication unmedicated Behaviour vs Post medication medication behaviour,"Hey all! I just recently got diagnosis with ADHD about 1-2 months ago and started medication but don’t frequently use it and only use it as needed. 

I’ve been on Vyvanse for maybe 2 weeks now and have only been using it for the past little while to conduct tests for myself to see what I can do to maximize the effects of the medication. I’ve stopped as of recently since there’s not much work for me to do that may be mind intensive. 

As a result of stopping, I’ve noticed something. Before starting my medication, I would have considered myself to be semi capable of doing most things. I’ve developed systems around myself to not let the ADHD slip to not impact my life too much, one example being that I set alarms to remind myself of doing specific tasks. At the time I didn’t know these were systems that may have helped to combat it since I wasn’t aware it may have been ADHD. Since starting mediation and being off medication, I’ve noticed myself not using this system as much, sometimes not at all. 

This brings me to my main thought / question for you guys, I feel that my premedicated unmedicated self is slightly more capable than my post medicated unmedicated self (If this isn’t making sense, what I’m trying to say is that I feel like my unmedicated self before I started medication is slightly more capable than my unmedicated self after starting medication.

1mp192s,Little to no appetite and struggling to eat,"Hey Reddit,

I got diagnosed with combo ADHD & ADD in April this year. I have been prescribed 5mg Dexamphetamine 2 tablets three times a day. For the most part my diagnosis has been absolutely life changing. But I am now struggling HARD with eating. I am a 22 year old Female if this helps or means anything to this post 😂.  

I work week on week off in a DIDO role and when I’m working I leave home at 4:50am, work for 12hrs and then get home around 6:50pm. I find eating at work isn’t as bad because I have three designated food breaks so I try my best to eat as much as I can during those times but it’s still not great.

As for my week off work I feel like I completely forget to eat. Like I’ll have breakfast and then some days not eat until the late afternoon because I’ve genuinely not been hungry to the point I’ve forgotten to try and eat anything. I also don’t have my full dosage on my swing off as it was recommended by the psych to have rest days and lower amounts if im not having a big productive day.

I have always been somewhat of a binge eater prior to my diagnosis but now I feel like I am force feeding myself and eating breakfast, lunch and dinner is a chore.

I’m lucky if I finish half a meal and then I’m left feeling so sick from being hungry or just feeling lethargic and like shit.

I’ve lost about 6kgs since April and I haven’t worked out or been trying too. I know it’s normal to lose weight but I’m starting to worry that due to my lack of eating I’m going to not give my body the lovin and nutrients it needs.

I would love to know how yous deal with this and tips you use to deal with this and or could this be something to do with being on to high of a dosage.

1mof0h2,"Struggling with ""out of sight, out of mind"" friendships - what helps you remember to reach out?","Hi folks,

I genuinely care about the people in my life, but if they're not right in front of me or actively texting me, I literally forget they exist. I can go months without remembering to reach out to friends, not because I don't care, but because they're just not in my immediate awareness. Then I feel terrible when I realise how long it's been, which makes me avoid reaching out even more.

I've lost touch with so many good people because of this. I'll think ""I should text Paul"" at 2am, tell myself I'll do it tomorrow, and then completely forget by the next morning. Or for my friends who have emigrated, I'll remember to text them but it's already midnight where they are.

**What specific reminders or systems have actually worked for you** in maintaining friendships? (Not just ""set a reminder"" - but what KIND of reminders, how often, what format?)

**What information about your friends do you wish you could easily access** when you do remember to reach out? (Birthdays, last conversation topic, their timezone, recent life events, etc.)

**What makes you more likely to actually follow through** on reaching out vs. just dismissing a reminder?

**How do you handle the guilt/shame cycle** when you realize you've been ghosting someone unintentionally?

**What would make social maintenance feel less overwhelming?**

I'm working on some tools to help myself with this issue, and I want to make sure I'm addressing the real pain points that people actually experience, not just what I think might be helpful. Your insights would help me understand if I'm on the right track or missing something important.

I know everyone is different, but I'm hoping some of you have found strategies that work. Even small things that have helped you stay connected to people you care about would be incredibly valuable to hear about.

I was on Vyvanse and titrated up and down, however it all ended up leaving me with a sense of depression and loss of interest in things I normally like to do. Tried eating protein around it, taking vitamins supplements, all the troubleshooting steps of meds..

So I’ve decided to go and give Adderall another try which is what I originally went for a year ago when I was diagnosed. I’ve been playing around with 15 mg XR and some days I’ll do 15 mg IR split in 2 doses about 4 hours apart (7.5 mg & 7.5 mg). 

I’ve noticed a significant more ‘get up and go’ effect of the Adderall which is what I’m needing and has been very pleasant.

Basically I just want to know what you all have found to be your proper dosing schedule between Adderall XR and IR, and which one you liked more.

At least, this particular care team won’t let me and I’m unable to switch doctors. Even a low dose of stimulants is out of the question for them.

I've tried everything from complex productivity systems to fancy apps, but they all felt too complicated or overwhelming.

Recently I discovered something that's been working for me on most days: limiting myself to exactly three goals per day, structured in a specific way:

1. **One most important task** (the high-impact thing that actually moves the needle)
2. **One long-term procrastination task** (something I've been avoiding but really need to do)
3. **One simple house chore** (something quick that gives me a sense of accomplishment)

The magic seems to be in the limitation and the variety. Three feels manageable instead of overwhelming. Having one ""easy win"" with the chore gives me momentum, while the important task ensures I'm making real progress on what matters. The procrastination task helps me chip away at those things I keep putting off.

What I love about this approach is that it eliminates decision fatigue about what to work on next, doesn't feel overwhelming like 10+ item lists, makes each day feel like a fresh start, provides a mix of difficulty levels that keeps me engaged, and is actually achievable most days.

I'm not perfect with it, but on the days I stick to just these three categories, I feel so much more focused and accomplished. The structure gives my ADHD brain clear boundaries while still allowing flexibility in what those three things actually are.

I’ve dated people in the past who didn’t have mental health issues, so this is the first time I’ve dated someone who also has a mental health disorder, one that we have in common. Anyway, like to hear from others on here about this. 😅",1755032358.0,4,3,ADHD,adhd

1mnuwju,I’m bad at knowing my wife is talking to me and it’s gotten me in a bad situation,"My wife has just admitted that she’s starting to resent the fact that I always ask her to repeat herself. 

Ex: tonight I was reading an article on my phone. By the time I realized she was talking to me, she was halfway through her sentence. This has been a problem before, and I’ve apologized in the past and really try to be better, but the combo of auditory processing and attention issues makes this happen a lot. 

When I realized she was talking to me, I immediately apologized and put my phone down, saying “I’m sorry I didn’t realize you were talking to me can you please start over?” She got so mad saying she’s sick of repeating herself. A bit later I asked if she could start by saying my name to get my attention and she said she feels like it shouldn’t be on HER to make sure I listen to her. 

I understand how hard it must be to not feel valued or heard, but I can’t just tell my brain to work properly! I don’t know what else to do. I feel like asking her to get my attention like that isn’t a huge ask but I know how she she’s that as me asking her to fix it. 

PLEASE HELP. Any advice or tips. My heart is breaking but I don’t know how to fix my brain when I’m not intentionally ignoring 

UPDATE: She apologized and said she’s gonna try to be better at getting my attention. I tried to sleep on the couch last night and she was like “why? I love you!” ",1754960636.0,146,143,ADHD,adhd
1moivtd,Advice how to calm down after an argument?,"Hello. I'm currently undiagnosed and awaiting assessment, but pretty certain I have ADD / inattentive ADHD.

One of the traits I seriously struggle with is emotional regulation, and this is magnified by incidents like arguments. It's incredibly hard to bring myself back down to calm after feeling angry or upset, and I end up on loop going over things.

I've had quite a horrible argument with a family member today, and every time I start levelling out a bit I keep spiralling back into feeling distressed. Does anyone experience the same, and have any advice on how to ease this? I tried to resolve the row but it didn't work and trying again isn't an option right now unfortunately, so I just need to find a way to relax, and coping mechanisms for this sort of thing in the future would be great.

1modwng,How do you deal with other people forcing you to mask?,"I feel like this is a really big deal that nobody with ADHD talks about. When we talk about masking, we usually talk about how we’re afraid of being seen as problems but then finally be happy being ourselves when we unmask. That’s an important thing to learn… but what about everyone else?

Personally, I wouldn’t mind talking to myself. I wouldn’t mind pacing around the subway station waiting for a train. I wouldn’t mind jumping around and bouncing off the walls in my house. Except when we do these things, we’re met with discipline, scolding, and negative stigma. It’s been that way ever since childhood, and I can only assume the reason we’re trying to make ourselves believe otherwise is because of optimistic and ideal advice people try to give to help others.

And boundaries are off the table, either. I try to talk to my parents about them scolding me? I have to learn to be more disciplined. I try to tell them that I don’t want to mask and they’re treating it too harshly? No, they still insist everyone else is going to think I’m crazy, it’s not them treating it as crazy the most out of everyone. I try to tell them they’re being argumentative? That’s who they are and they choose to suffer the consequences for it. I try to tell them how much effort I’m putting in life aside from that? “Put in more. For every part of your life.”

And the worst part? Despite how supportive and loving they are in general, everyone in my life who’s known me for long is prone to doing this. EVERYONE.

Now I don’t know if I should just suck it up or if I’m gonna pay the piper for doing it later in life because how much energy it takes to mask. Is there a solution here, or is the scolding going to be inevitable?",1755017131.0,7,8,ADHD,adhd

1moa119,ADHD diagnosis at 26 – how do I finally quit smoking?,"Hey everyone,
I wanted to ask if anyone here has gone through something similar.

I had my first cigarette when I was 12 – and I was instantly hooked. By the time I was 14 or 15, I was smoking regularly, and over the years it just kept increasing. Honestly, I even enjoy smoking.

Now, at 26, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, and looking back, I realize smoking was probably a form of self-medication. In about two months, I’m likely starting my first medication for ADHD. But here’s my concern: I’m worried that the meds might actually make my smoking worse instead of better.

Has anyone experienced this? Did your smoking habits change after starting ADHD medication – for better or worse? And do you have any tips for quitting when nicotine has basically been part of your life since childhood?

1moijvi,Some insight about Vyvanse and blood circulation,"So, I had blood circulation issues already, particularly in my toes. In the winter time, they'd get itchy and sensitive. So when I started Vyvanse and moved up to 40mg, after a few weeks, my toes were purple! I actually didn't notice until I was on it for about 7 months. Oops.

Once I noticed though, I didn't attribute it to Vyvanse, I'd just thought it was my regularly scheduled winter time toe trouble. But after some research I learned that Vyvanse can affect circulation.

So I brought it up to my doctor. She hadn't seen this symptom present itself in this way before. After a vascular study and a blood test, they came back clear! No cryoglobins, so no Raynaud's. We were pretty surprised. So she said to stop taking the Vyvanse for a month just to see.

I, against her judgment, finished my supply of 11 days left of medications, and then ceased. On the 3rd full day without it, I noticed that my toes had cleared up. Phenomenal. So I again decided to go against her wishes and went on a two days off schedule. Vyvanse one day, two full days without, rinse and repeat.

The evidence was clear. My toes cleared up of purple within a full day. So after two weeks of that schedule, I swapped to taking it every 2nd day. It was very consistent.

We've switched to a non stimulant as my daily main, with an even weaker stimulant (switching to Ritalin) as needed for shorter bursts of productivity. Haven't started this yet as of writing.

Anyway, the point of this post is...if you already have circulation issues, Vyvanse might make your toes purple!",1755027270.0,3,1,ADHD,adhd

The psych who did the extensive evaluation clearly stated in her report that a stimulant based medication will be very helpful in my situation, and in her opinion I should reap almost immediate benefits.

My PCP of course starts me on 18mg of Strattera. I do have HBP but it’s controlled well, I’m also down 70 pounds since Dec 23, exercise, the whole nine. I’ve done well for myself in regard to improving my health. Third week in taking Strattera the only difference I feel is fatigue, even on this low dose. I’m certain upping the dose when I run out won’t change anything, probably will worsen. 

Seeking advice on how to get past this roadblock? I work in IT, and although I’ve coped and adapted, my condition has taken its toll over the years. I have a great PCP, but out the gate he was talking about therapy and other routes instead of just trying any stimulant based medication.

She’s self-employed as a freelancer, managing several demanding roles, from teaching to writing. One of the biggest challenges has been follow-through on the “business side” of her work—things like sending invoices or completing small administrative tasks. Some projects from as far back as a year ago remain unpaid simply because the invoices were never sent. She’s shared that, once the creative or engaging part of the work is done, it’s hard for her to shift into those less exciting tasks, and they often slip her mind.

When she does have downtime—the kind of time that could be used for follow-up emails or invoices—she often turns to her phone instead, scrolling as a way to unwind.

I recently started Ritalin in June, and it's been life changing for me. It has helped my depression tremendously and has also helped with my ADHD symptoms- it gives me the push I need to get things done, whereas without it, I feel almost completely unmotivated.

I am currently on 40 mg, and take 20 mg in the morning around 12:00 pm and 20 mg in the afternoon around 4-5pm, but will soon be taking it earlier around 9/10:00 am once college starts back up. I have noticed recently that my anxiety has spiked, especially when I take my second dose- at night, I feel a sensation like small bugs are crawling on me/pins and needles in my hands, and my throat feels like it's closing up even if I haven't eaten. In addition, I am generally more paranoid and jumpy/dizzy. 

I have a history of general anxiety and anxiety regarding food/allergic reactions due to a severe peanut allergy, and believe the Ritalin is building on it.

I love Ritalin overall and it is by far the most helpful medication I have taken, but the anxiety symptoms I am experiencing are starting to get out of hand. Does anyone have experience with lowering their dosage and having some of these symptoms lessen? Additionally, has anyone had any success managing their increase in anxiety by, for example, eating or exercising more? 

I will be lowering my dosage to 30 mg starting tomorrow to see how I do for a couple of days. I am thinking 40 mg be too high of a dosage for me, as I weigh about 130 pounds.

Any other suggestions would be very helpful. Thank you in advance!",1755040334.0,1,1,ADHD,adhd

1mo8j78,Help with lip picking compulsion,"CW - discussion of compulsive habit, hopefully that's ok.

Hi there, I really suffer with a lip-picking compulsion as a result of my ADHD, specifically hyperactivity. I shred my lips to the point they bleed and scar. I feel so shameful admitting this what a struggle this is and I've tried to deal with it for my whole life (I'm in my 40s now), even as a child. It's definitely worse when anxious or stressy or masking badly. I've asked doctors/therapists and they just act like I'm a freak and ignore me. In my life I'm a pretty chill and happy person and manage my ADHD day to day by my lifestyle! So I'm not in crisis or anything but I'm sick of this ongoing struggle.  
  
Has anyone who suffers with this found anyyyyyyyything that helps that doesn't rely on policing myself (I'm lawless), or on anything that involves counting in any way? For example yoga/breathing exercises trigger the compulsion BADLY because it sets me off counting which leads to an explosion in picking. I'm pro medication but have a conflicting health condition that means I can't take ADHD meds unfortunately or trust me I would. 

I stay hydrated and wear lip chap so help but eventually I find myself (graphic, warning) like digging into my lips with my nails. I don't even know I'm doing it. I've done CBT but it made it worse because everything depended on redirecting to other habits and things that involved counting. 

As an aside, I looked into OCD but I don't come anywhere close to fitting diagnostic criteria. The ADHD diagnosing psych said this general type of thing is super common with people with ADHD . He classed it as an ADHD trait in my diagnosis. Apologies if this doesn't go here, I hope it's ok to ask. 

I hope that made sense. So grateful for help and sympathy to anyone else who suffers with this. ",1755004770.0,5,6,ADHD,adhd

In therapy I came to the realization that many of my relationships, romantic and social alike, were predicated on the logic that ""if they are willing to accept me then I should be in the relationship"" (sad I know). This has led to lots of strained relationships because I may not even enjoy the relationship but I stay friends or romantic partners with them because I feel like I can't seek a relationship that I really want because they'd likely not want to be with me.

All that to say, I have found myself in a marriage where we have grown increasingly distant and our communication has deteriorated to where it feels like we are just pretending to be close. BUT I am afraid that this is just my ADHD brain that desires change and stimulation driving me away from my partner, so I stay in the relationship.

Does anyone have advice on knowing how to distinguish when a relationship is legitimately not working and when it's your ADHD tendencies driving a wedge in your relationship?

If the skin over your knuckles is close too see-through. Because once you let loose, it feels like everything you've built so far will run like sand through your fingers.

If for whatever reason the tile spoke to you.

Be kinder to yourself. That **does not** mean to hell with ambitions and responsibilities. But soften the grip. You would not like to talk to your own child like that. Because you know what it does to a young mind. No matter the hack, tool, or practice that might do the trick this time, with an attitude of a prison warden, it won't stay around for long. And not long, until you wish for the next quick fix, to something that runs deeper, which can only barely be reached with those tools.

Be kinder to yourself. Treat yourself like you'd treat a child you want to raise. Find a balance of responsibilities and rest, of pressure and play. Find the right level of challenge. Give your inner child the patience it needed from the world. Be curious for what it has to bring to the table.

I’d like to try a slightly different approach to habits and experiment instead of committing and fooling myself into thinking a habit will change everything. But before trying and unintentionally getting hyperfocused and burning out, I want to ask you:

* Have you tried listening to your body and mind, and picking habits accordingly?
* Have you tried experimenting with new habits for 7–14 days instead of committing long term?
* Have you tried journaling how you feel when you’re trying out habits that are needed at the moment rather than long term?
* Does that make sense at all, or am I just overthinking and pushing myself toward another burnout?
* Is there anything else I could think about and try — methods that actually worked for you in situations like mine?

But I cant since I barely have money left. Applying for jobs I know ill hate is so tiring, plus I am applying for jobs that has a long application process. This has made my mood extremely bad and I feel tired everyday just thinking about things.  I am also  having an identity crisis. Like I cant apply for roles or industries thatI feel fit who I am, yet I feel my math+technical skills are insufficient for STEM jobs. My family dont have the means to support me so I need to get a job as soon as possible.

I have tried Ritalin, Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse. None of them improved my ADHD symptoms. My doctor had me go see a psychiatrist who confirmed the ADHD diagnosis. He is putting me on a last try on a stimulant: focaline. He suggests a non-stimulant after that. What is your experience with non-stimulants for those who have tried? Thank you!!

1mnt4zc,You’re annoying,"I was hanging out with friends and found out I annoy one of the people in our group, in front of everyone. This was also announced on behalf of another member of the group. I haven’t been told I’m annoying in such a long time and I’m worried other people have just been polite when I’ve gotten to them. 

I’m not sure if I’m embarrassed that it was announced to the group or just bummed that I annoyed someone so badly that it had to be said. 

I’m trying to not be devastated in fear that my attitude can end up annoying more people. 

This group of friends hangs out weekly and I can’t decide if I just sit out a few weeks to distance or just go with them and act like nothing happened (while constantly trying to be less annoying)

Should I say something to the one I’ve annoyed or just let it roll?

1mobz84,To take stimulants or not?,"I have always wondered if someone who described feeling euphoric or can’t sleeps when taking stimulants needs them.

I’ve read horror stories about people diagnosed with ADHD and have been prescribed stimulants, only to them be prescribed sleep meds because they can’t sleep. This just starts a vicious and what’s seems to be an unnecessary cycle.

What I am asking is:

Do you really have ADHD if the meds make you high or unable to sleep? (This is an honest question since I don’t know.)

As someone with ADHD shouldn’t you feel normal and be able to focus and sleep when taking stimulants?

If it’s possible to have ADHD but taking stimulants makes you high and/or can’t sleep, do they really need them?

Edit: The above (last) question is what I’m really wondering.
Maybe someone needs to have adjustments made? I’m just concerned so many people seem to be taking meds that don’t work/potentially harm them.

Thank you to everyone who answers. I’ve had these questions for a long time.

Say a family member or friend wants you to watch something, do something, play something and it's something you've done before or gives you 0 interest. There have been times in the past where you tried to - to be a good friend or relative but you end up bored, understimulated or even overstimulated from masking/ paying attention. And then you turn into an ahole because you're overstimulated.

So my sister wants me to play this game with her; it's a popular visual novel game that I've played and or watched playthroughs of MANY different times. I know the game well and have kind of tired out my interest in it. The game is pretty linear and there isn't anything new that I haven't already experienced. She also knows the game so I'm not even getting to experience HER first look. The idea of playing this AGAIN and listening to her read every single piece of dialogue out loud sounds pretty bad. 

My (20) sister (15) is autistic and struggles to perceive my emotions of overwhelm as anything other than disliking her, even when I don't take it out on her, or try my best to explain other times that when I get like that it's not personal. So to try and save her the heartbreak and/or causing an argument I say no, and explain it doesn't interest me and I'm probably not going to be able to engage with it the way she wants me to, and she'll get upset and it'll be a whole thing. We even come up with other games we both like and want to play together. But she really just wants to play this one game with her and can't understand why I won't just ""put up with it for her"".

I have tried putting up with things before and It doesn't go well and I have to remove myself anyway. I do not know how to make myself put up with things. I don't know if it is possible. Has anyone learned how to do it?

1mnzcp2,Reflecting on the HD based on what the Internet told me:,"Yes, if we look at it from a statistical and biological point of view, having ADHD is a notable stroke of bad luck:
	• It is permanent → it is not a phase, nor something that “passes” with maturity (although symptoms can change form).
	• It's invisible → you are often not understood, and receive criticism for things that actually stem from how your brain works.
	• Affects multiple areas simultaneously → attention, working memory, organization, emotional regulation, impulse control…
	• Increases the risk of other → anxiety, depression, burnout, financial problems, road accidents, addictions.
	• The social context makes everything worse → school, work and the rules of daily life are designed for a normal brain

1moqify,I feel like ADHD is just a whim,"Hi!

It’s all in the title. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and have been on Ritalin for ten months now. Getting the diagnosis was partly a relief because it put a name to what I was feeling. But at the same time, I’m still conflicted: ADHD used to be barely talked about, and now it feels like we’re putting labels on symptoms that are actually pretty common. For example, I recently came across the term “maladaptive daydreaming” — basically, compulsively creating scenarios in your head.

Honestly, I think we’ve become increasingly self-centered, naming minor issues compared to real disabilities like autism, and often glamorizing them (especially through memes), as if ADHD were some kind of lifestyle. Sometimes it feels like a way to feed our ego, to make ourselves feel unique and to justify anything just to avoid taking responsibility (like constantly being late or procrastinating).

I know this opinion is controversial. I’m not denying the disorder exists, but I do question our legitimacy to claim the same level of recognition as people who truly need help. Personally, I don’t feel entitled to complain or express suffering over ADHD because to me, its symptoms just don’t justify it.



Edit : There’s been a misunderstanding in the comments. I’ve spent most of my life dealing with the consequences of ADHD: an extremely limited attention span that holds me back professionally, massive procrastination, and an inability to stay still for more than ten minutes without moving… But my point remains the same: I’d rather keep what I feel to myself than put it all out there for everyone to see.

1mmv8h4,This trick to drink water seems to have worked on me (so far),"Like many of you, I struggle to drink plain water. I can go the whole week without drinking a drop of plain water. I’ve tried alarms, apps on the phone or watch, nothing sticks.

But the other day I saw someone mention that they drink a cup of water every time after they pee. So I tried that and, omg, it’s quite NEAT! I guess the reason I hated the reminders was cause I’d be doing something and I’d have to STOP and GET UP to drink water (having a waterbottle annoyed me for some reason).

But pee? That’s your body’s natural notification! If you don’t answer it, you’ll be doing that silly little contortion dance until you pee yourself! So you HAVE to get up to do it. And since you’re up, on the way back you get a glass of water and chug it down, then it’s back to whatever you were doing!

I was prescribed 10mg Adderall IR twice a day, for a total dose of 20mg a day. However, I've noticed that I experience irritability as my doses wear off. The morning dose irritability is easily curbed by taking my afternoon dose, but nothing can be done to stop the irritability that comes in the evening as my afternoon dose wears off. My irritability typically manifests as feeling overstimulated, and as a result, I can tend to get a bit snippy at people, especially my mom. I always apologize immediately afterwards, but it makes me feel like a bit of a dick, to be honest. I've been working on coping strategies, but I was wondering if anyone here has experienced anything similar and can tell me what worked for them. Many thanks in advance!",1754949409.0,9,5,ADHD,adhd

I (25f) have been diagnosed since college and after getting COVID starting developing symptoms that myself and two primaries think could be a form of dysautonomia. While waiting for cardiologists to address my high HR I was taken off my adderall for a few years. My life had suffered and now my cardiologist isn’t necessarily addressing the issue so I told my primary I need my adderall back to finish college and then we can sort out my heart stuff. So I’ve been back on it for 4 days now and my heart rate has been significantly lower, I walked up and down stairs 4 times in an hour and was still at a ‘normal’ rate, I’ve found that I’ve always felt I breathe shallow but these last days I’ve felt so natural breathing without struggling through my day all day every day.

does anyone else with adhd have crazy vivid dreams every night?? i saw this tiktok saying it’s common and now i’m wondering if that’s why i’ve always been like this.

like my dreams aren’t just random little flashes, they’re full on movies. plot, side characters, different locations, sometimes even smells?? and i’ll wake up remembering whole conversations word-for-word. it’s every single night too, not just once in a while.

the tiktok basically said adhd brains are already on overdrive during the day, so at night they don’t really slow down either. all that imagination and constant thinking just keeps going in dream mode, which could make everything feel way more intense. there’s also something about how adhd can mess with sleep cycles, maybe more time in rem sleep or waking up more often, so you catch more of your dreams before they fade.

idk if it’s officially “scientifically proven” or whatever, but it kinda makes sense. i’ve had friends without adhd tell me they barely ever dream or remember them, and i’m like ??? could not be me. only met one other person and he seems like he has adhd . in diagnosed tho

1mnpsvq,Fought a doctor for Ritaline,"I first suspected ADHD at 17–19, but now I’m 24 and only just got Ritalin. In Belgium, a diagnosis costs around €2,000, and for years every psychiatrist dismissed me. Instead, I got labeled with anxiety, depression, PTSD, even psychosis, and was put on endless meds that didn’t help.

One night, after a fight and a betrayal, I self-medicated with Lyrica and alcohol. I ended up in an ambulance, treated like I was a burden. At the ER, the nurse attending me was cold and dismissive from the start. High, angry, and hurt, I mocked her for only having a cat to go home to and questioned whether helping people truly fulfilled her. Not my proudest moment, but after years of being treated like nothing, it felt like reclaiming my voice.

Then the doctor came. I told her their “first world” healthcare was less compassionate than my home country’s, that they were cold and money-driven, and asked if she wasn’t ashamed of that. When she said I couldn’t leave until morning, I insisted I was going, and when she tried to stop me, I pushed and hit her, then ran. The same nurse followed me — I told her to “fuck off and go back to her cat.” Not my proudest moment. But I had been compliant, kind and cooperative for years. Resisting years of dismissal and coldness, I had enough. 

The next day, I saw a new GP. He listened, believed me, and prescribed Ritalin. A month in, the change is unreal — the white noise is gone, my mood is better, and I finally feel like myself.

But Ritalin requires psychiatric follow-up, which means going back into the same system that failed me for years. I’m terrified they’ll take this away. I’ve thought about going back to my home country for care, but I’m hoping someone here will finally see me and help me keep this progress.

1mnogga,How to deal with being easily irritable,"I have always been someone that gets irritable really easily from the smallest things. It is the worst when I'm with my family, and my parents are really good at making me get so annoyed from the smallest things they do and I shut down super fast even when I know I shouldn't be annoyed.

Well recently I got into a relationship (about two months of dating now). And I really like this person, but for some reason I have been getting irritable/annoyed from small things they do that are perfectably reasonable. Maybe they will ask an obvious question or something and I will get this rush of emotion (idk how to describe it apart from annoyance). Then, I will immediately feel guilty and anxious because why did I just get so annoyed from my partner? Then I will shut down and not want to talk and just be overthinking and in my head thinking I'm a bad partner and then start worrying about the future despite knowing this is a super new relationship and I do really like them. I just feel like my brain is sabatoging me at all times.

Sorry for the disjointed post- this is something I've always dealt with and its a big reason I live alone and also spend a lot of time with myself. I am on 10mg ritalin IR once a day. I am starting with a low dose since this is my first time being medicated. I have found that when my medication is active, for only like a few hours in the morning after I take it, that I am in in a really great mood and I find it super easy to talk to people and hold conversations without masking, but I usually am at work during these times not with my partner.

I can’t stand lying in bed when I’m not completely exhausted. My brain just won’t shut up – I start thinking about the time I’ll have to wake up, how many hours are left, what I need to do tomorrow, and random memories from years ago.
It almost feels like a kind of resistance or even anxiety. I’m not sure if it’s ADHD, or maybe something from childhood – I remember hating “bedtime” as a kid, especially when I wasn’t tired, and it still hasn’t changed.

Instead of getting relaxed, I just get more restless, frustrated, and overstimulated. I’ll get up, scroll my phone, watch something, and before I know it, it’s 4 AM.
It’s like my brain wants to run on “empty” before it agrees to shut down.

I’ve been doing the same thing — stuck in bed at night, phone in hand, jumping from one short video to another, convincing myself I’m “relaxing” when really I’m spiraling into this numb, anxious, disconnected state. I’d wake up feeling even worse, like my brain had been scraped raw overnight.

I was diagnosed with ADHD last year at 23, and ever since, a lot of things started making sense… but also, it made me realize just how deeply I’ve been shaped by this nonstop digital noise. The internet has been a lifeline and a trap. And at night, when it’s quiet, I feel it the most — the way my mind refuses to turn off, the way I’m craving stimulation and drowning in it at the same time.

I’ve started doing this one small thing that’s actually been helping: I unplug completely at night and use some light set up, or something like a little galaxy light projector (not connected to Wi-Fi, no apps, nothing fancy). It just fills the ceiling with soft, slowly moving stars. There’s something about focusing on that gentle motion that quiets the part of my brain that’s usually screaming. I watch the lights until my breathing slows down, until the panic thins out just enough for sleep to happen.

It’s not a cure. But it’s something. And I just wanted to say, I see you. I get it. You’re not lazy or broken — you’re surviving in a world that wasn’t designed with people like us in mind.

If it helps at all: You’re not alone.

Now, I wonder if this is something I am comfortable inheriting to a child. Also, if my ADHD will make me the type of parent I had.

Does your diagnosis influence(d) your decision to have kids? 

Edit:

In the name of fairness, let me give you a bit of context about my position. 

I know my mom loves me. I know she loved me when I was a kid. I just didn’t grow up feeling loved (maybe early RSD 🤷). But that’s my concern with me having kids. My reference framework for parenting is not something I would like to repeat, but it is the only one I have. Equally, me as an undiagnosed ADHD kid must have been a button-pusher machine who drove my mom to an inch of her insanity (which with her emotional dysregulation wasn’t a good idea). 

Hence, my concern if I happen to pass on this brain of mine to a new person. Will I be OK fathering a kid to existence with a not-so-slim chance to have ADHD? Simultaneously, can my own ADHD allow me to be the parent *they* will need me to be?

1mmx9jb,How life changing a ADHD diagnosis is.,"I am a 42 year old recently diagnosed and treated for ADHD. I feel like a light bulb finally went on in my head. I struggle with relationships and just simply living. Once I started taking the medication I was upset for the first few months that this is how people live their life! They were excited to get up in the morning, read books, watch movies, listen to music, enjoy so many beautiful things about life that I never ever got the pleasure of. But that all changed I now  get up excited to start the day! I finally after 41 years can read any book I want and understand it and I finally want to use my VA benefits and go to a university to learn anything. Music was something that I could never understand the words too, let alone sing. Remarkably though I can sing!   I can even sing, songs that I thought I didn’t know the words to.  Listening is now effortless! It is absolutely incredible to put your mind to something and be able to anything you want to. I see the dynamics of how relationships work and play so I can finally save myself from future abuse.

• Vyvanse – maxed out at 70mg

Next up is Adderall XR, probably starting tomorrow. If that doesn’t work either, I’ll need to switch to short-acting meds, since the ADHD clinic I’m with only prescribes long-acting ones and they try 3 brands first then directed back to a doctor to steer towards a short term medication.

1mmf5no,Early boarding = LIFE CHANGING,"Hello all - I just learned that having adhd qualifies you for early boarding for planes!! This was life changing for me  I was able to get on the plane early and settle in without the anxiety of hurrying to get my items up and find where I misplaced my items, etc. This was an amazing accommodation that I had no idea existed!! 

Edit: in the United States, you can qualify for early boarding if you have a disability covered under ADA, which ADHD does. Because I’m a human being with common sense, I would naturally let a person who had a physical disability go before me and I would be very patient (and have been) with any one who needs it, such as elderly etc. 

Under HIPAA, the airlines cannot ask what disability you have. You can just walk up to the gate attendant, and say you have a disability, and ask if it would be possible if you board early. Simple as that. 

If you don’t want to do this - great! Then don’t. 

If you think it could help you - great! Then do it! 

Everyone’s adhd and other disabilities are unique to them. You do what is best for you and do not give a second thought about what others think. You make the right choice for you. ",1754821843.0,1391,240,ADHD,adhd

I can just retake it and do better the next time, and these assignments are due tonight but I still have an extra week to at least turn them in for some credit. UGH like I just keep making excuses.

I was medicated my whole life before that but the military was a constant go go go thing so I also didn't feel like I needed it as much as I Do now.

He says he’s talking about someone else he knows, but it makes me really self conscious because I’m not really sure what he means by that. 

By bringing up my ADHD when it’s relevant or when I’m struggling with something in particular, am I making it my whole personality? I intentionally don’t use it to make excuses for things, because I know my decisions are still under my control. 

Where do you draw the line between having ADHD and making it your personality? Can someone explain what he’s talking about when he says people make it their whole personality?

My partner is aware I had ADD. I've mentioned it to him when we were friends and he helped me with processing the news. He is really great. 

One thing that I am really hard on myself is 
- In the morning and at night I tend to get tired and very foggy brained. So I'm not really talkative and my attention span / focus is really weak. Due to that I often feel really boring or I worry that my partner is bored. He tends to be very chatty when we go on our morning walks but i really struggle to even make a full sentence response. 
I also find i dont hear what my partner says the first time and have to ask him to repeat. He's really good and repeats although i do understand it can be frustrating for him.

I want to be clear that I am open with him about how I feel about myself in those mornings and he is really good with me. He reassures me. Tells me all the things that he does love about me, like how close I am to his family, how I get along with his friends etc. 

I just find that this situation gives me a lot of anxiety and I don't want this to ruin my relationship with him as it is only a few months old.

I have near complete freedom in my job with little oversight. This sounds great! But in reality it means difficulty starting projects, project tasks, or even the day is sometimes crippling.

My work is super important to me. The less I do, the less good I do for the community I care about.

So i just got diagnosed like a month and a bit ago with ADHD (took the test and answered as honest as i could and got the results that i do have ADHD) and i got medicated at first with Concerta 18mg, the first few days were ok (except the side effects but they were bearable) and i could see a slight improvement on my day to day stuff like being able to concentrate more on the task i have and finish it or not taking too many unnecesarry breaks cus im distracted and stuff like that but after that everything got back to how i was before the meds.

Talked with my psychiatrist and after a month i got Concerta but 36mg this time but i cant really see any substantial improvements and i still find  it very hard to actually start doing different things, either cleaning or cooking or exercising etc or building habits. Basically i feel like im in a freeze of some sorts if it makes sense. I have a few days since i started 36mg and maybe i should give a bit of time but i don't know if i'm actually doing something wrong or should i try other meds. Im pretty new to the whole ADHD topic so any tips or suggestion would be appreciated.",1754920237.0,3,6,ADHD,adhd

1mmn5gx,Millions of individuals are roaming around not knowing they have ADHD.,"To think that there are millions of individuals globally who, as of today, subconsciously feel like something is “off” and “not quite right” with themselves just like I did a few years ago and continue to struggle not knowing what the problem is puzzles me.

Several studies have suggested that only a fraction of adults who have ADHD have a formal diagnosis, and of those that do, only a fraction are receiving treatment. This problem is especially exacerbated in countries and cultures where mental health and psychiatry is stigmatized, medication is illegal, and resources are underdeveloped.

There’s a select cohort of people I’ve met in life via school, work, and hobbies who, looking back, resemble the hallmarks of ADHD and may not even know.

I think about how a poster on a subway train/station or an Instagram ad that reads all the symptoms of ADHD is just enough to alert and get certain people thinking as they’re randomly going about their day to give them that “aha” moment and make all the difference.",1754843736.0,144,35,ADHD,adhd
1mnmix8,Feeling bad about diagnosis and starting meds,"Earlier this year I went to my uni to seek a diagnosis. Honestly the didn’t really care for what but I knew that I was struggling a lot and didn’t know what to do about it. After a long while of waiting for my follow up appointment I just received an official “congrats you have inattentive adhd” and the dr has me set to start with vyvanse. But i just feel really bad about it. 

There was no proper looking into anything, the dr just took the sheets that i and another person is supposed to fill and told me she’s just going to fill in boxes to see if it fits. And when i was telling her specific examples and childhood reports where i had problems she seemed very unconvinced and asked if it’s just because i just don’t want to do things i don’t like and if i was sure the problems i have at work isn’t because im not trying to do well. In the end i got diagnosed, told there is clear evidence that there’s congnitive issues but i seem to be doing fine.

I know i probably am being overly sensitive about it all but i just feel like i pushed for it just to say i have adhd and take blame off of myself for my mistakes. but at the same time I am genuinely struggling despite trying my hardest.  I am on the brink of losing my job even though i spend hours outside of my shifts practicing and memorizing and constantly repeating things to myself. I spend 100s every year to replace things from losing my wallet or forgetting appointments so often. I almost failed out of high school because i stopped going to classes after i was struggling in class but no one believed me or gave help when i asked multiple times that i needed support because “im a bright girl” and will figure it out on my own. whether im experiencing this because of my own doing or adhd i still know that i unable to do so much because im still figuring out how to get to square one. 

But yeah i am genuinely just hoping that the meds help me cause none of this is fun at all.

1mnejeo,Meds interacting best with insomnia?,"I (28F) am just diagnosed and soon going on meds. I have an appointment to discuss meds in a few days. The issue is, I have insomnia already- it's quite bad at the moment. I know there are both stimulant and non-stimulant meds, and I'm much more inclined to try the stimulant ones (non-stimulate meds apparently take time to work and the effect 'builds up' and is long-lasting, and the consultant said they can help with emotional dysregulation ... The thing is, I kind of like my happy extremes and excitability about things. I dont want a long lasting med that will dampen down my vibrant personality, spontaneous dancing etc. I just want something that will help me to focus at work when I need to).

So I'm worried about Ritalin or Vyvanse making my insomnia worse, but was wondering- has it actually helped anyone with sleep? Like, I'm wondering if being more stimulated during the day can help u crash at night. I know for myself with coffee, if I drink a tonne of coffee in the morning I will sleep better than if I drink none at all 😅🥲. So I'm looking for some personal experiences; I know what Google says and what the consultant will likely say- that stimulant meds can cause insomnia. But Google and any Dr would also say coffee would cause sleep disturbances, whereas it helps me if I have it before noon. So would love to hear any personal experiences on this. 🫶🐥

10 days ago I started Vyvanse generic (Teva), first time on any stimulant. I got diagnosed recently so I'm making a few tries with different medications. 

For people who started taking the generic first, did you feel awful? Had barely functioned and got many side effects?

I'm asking because this is my case. I talked with my doctor about how the generic was a bad choice and I made a mistake taking the generic instead of the brand when I was in a pharmacy. I will try the brand version soon to compare if it will get better or not. 

However, she made an important observation: that most of people that doesn't work well in the generic is actually because was taking the brand Vyvanse first and then switched for the generic. So there is a chance that actually Vyvanse won't be different for me. 

Please share your experience 

EDIT: In case anyone is curious, I tried today Vyvanse and not the generic from Teva. I’m very happy to confirm that the problem was the generic, it didn’t work for me. Vyvanse were so much better! The side effects don’t disappear but they are not as strong as the generic. The relaxation and silence in the head lasted much longer as well!

1mmkl0m,Can’t be productive when there’s anyone in the house. I’m so much more productive when I’m alone.,"This is my first post ever, please be kind 🙏

My partner is away on work for the weekend and right now I’ve had the most productive day of the year. I’ve felt in flow, finished my todo list (that never happens) and I’m not nearly as worn out as I usually am by this time each day (currently the afternoon). 

I’m grateful to have someone that understands my ADHD but it’s like I can’t zone in unless I’m the only person in the house (even if she’s three rooms away, not making any noise at all).

For context, I’m currently awaiting medication after a recent diagnosis.

1mn5aa3,Turns out I’m Functionally Cross-Dominant. How About You?,"About a week ago I found out I’m functionally cross-dominant (also called mixed-handed or cross-lateral). This means I don’t consistently favor the same hand or side of my body for all tasks. Instead, I use different hands for different activities, often based on what feels natural or practical for me. Originally I thought I was ambidextrous. 

For me this looks like:

I write with my right hand, I can with my left but its messy

Use chopsticks with equally well with either hand, but usually my left

I use a left handed bow for archery, I can use my right but it just feels really wrong

In karate my left left is my best kicking leg, right arm for punches

I play badminton, tennis etc with the racquet in either hand, and frequently change hands while playing

I can do very fine precision work, like hand placing surface mount parts on a PCB, soldering equally well with either hand and often swap as I’m working

I use my knife in my left hand and fork in the right, but they seem to swap around a bit 

I hold my phone for typing in my left hand

Throw a ball with either arm

Funny thing is I’m also dyslexic and I've noticed my hands seem to swap sometimes and I don’t notice! Often I forget which hand I normally use for my knife and fork at the dinner table and just end up making it up on the spot, usually ending up with the knife in my left hand.

It seems there is a correlation between being functionally cross-dominant and neurodiversity which is interesting. It’s associated with flexible brain lateralization, meaning my left/right hemispheres share roles more fluidly.
 
Does anyone else have experience with being functionally cross-dominant? If so, how does it work for you?

1mncq7q,Ritalin LA 20mg doesn’t seem to be working properly,"Guys, I have ADHD and was being treated until now with Ritalin IR 10 mg, taking one dose at 8 a.m. and another at 1 p.m. It worked perfectly, giving me focus, calmness, and helping me avoid procrastination. However, my doctor prescribed Ritalin LA as a test for the convenience of not having to take it twice a day, etc.

But the effect feels quite different, to begin with, it seems much weaker. I don’t “feel” it as much, and sometimes it’s like I just have some extra energy without necessarily having the focus that Ritalin IR gives me, so I end up doing random things or starting activities without finishing them.

In the afternoon, the effect also seems to wear off more quickly.

Is it generally weaker than Ritalin IR? I’m currently taking 20 mg of the LA version. Has anyone had a similar experience? Thanks.",1754918234.0,1,2,ADHD,adhd

I won't go into details but I now have a somewhat short-term goal whereas before I was just drifting. I have a very rough idea of what I need to achieve, but I don't know anything about how to get there. All of a sudden it's like everything has overwhelmed me and I don't have time to take a breather. I wish I had just a week or two to myself to pause, plan, and care for myself, but I can't take that much time off work right now. 

Right now, my life is the same as always. But if I want to achieve my goals for the next few years, I have to make some big changes and sacrifices. I feel like I'd be emotionally and mentally prepared for it if I wasn't drowning in my daily life. I'm up way later than usual right now, feeling incapable of falling asleep, and just feeling mentally paralyzed by a shit ton of things I need to get in order. I just don't know how to approach this situation and get back on track. Every time I think I've gotten some control over my life, I have a night like this where I feel completely useless and unsure of how to move forward again. I just want to feel emotionally stable for longer than a day or two.

1mn580u,Feeling stuck,"I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to post this, or if anyone will see it, I just wanna know if I’m not alone, and how to fix it.

So basically, end of 2023 (I was in highschool, graduated end of 2024) I got diagnosed with adhd and was prescribed vyvanse. It was great, I loved vyvanse, I mean I seriously turned my life around, it made studying a breeze and I just felt good. And then something went wrong. I don’t know what it was, but I’ve had these “episodes” maybe 4 times since then. I’ll just describe what I’m feeling now, because I’m in one of them.

Im in university and am in my second semester. I took vyvanse 50mg yesterday to study, and I felt nothing. Not that vyvanse did nothing, but I just felt like a zombie. I tried to study, but I couldn’t, I felt paralysed like I couldn’t begin because I felt so behind. It’s just so hard to put into words. But I would do some half assed study, it’s not like I was getting distracted, it’s just that I don’t wanna do anything. I don’t wanna use my phone and scroll instagram, I don’t wanna go to the gym, I sort of just sit and stare at a wall until it’s time to sleep, just to do it all over again.

I’m not sure how long this lasts, but I know that it ends, and I also know that it will happen again. I smoke green, and I’d mainly do it with my friends. But this has happened before I smoke, so I don’t think it’s caused by smoking, but it could definitely contribute. And by “this”, I mean this feeling of emptiness, just waiting to sleep because I don’t find joy in anything else.

I guess I’ve noticed that this will usually happen when I take vyvanse, maybe it’s a mix of uni and everything but yeah. I had about a month and half break off uni and it was great, I’d hang out with friends every day, smoke and just chill. But now, it’s happening again.

I’m sick of this cycle of feeling like this",1754892275.0,3,6,ADHD,adhd
1mnakuj,ADHD + Debt Payoff: How to stay motivated without losing it after a few weeks?,"Hey Everyone,
I could really use your tips and ideas, not on how to save money in general, but on how to actually stay in the game.

Quick backstory:
- I have open loans, credit card debt & multiple installment payments due impulsive, unnecessary spending 
- Living paycheck to paycheck, account is often “magically” empty cause of that
- motivated at the moment to pay them off and just made a strikt plan but scared to fail again 

Plan:
If I put a bit more into repayments every month from now, I could be done in 12 months.
That would leave me about €300/month (after all fixed costs) for everything: groceries, household, personal care, fun... I honestly don’t even know if €300 is a lot or a little which is embarrassing. I know I’ve managed on less before, but that was never intentional but because there was simply nothing left.

My problem:
I start in absolute hyperfocus, like now  perfectly planned, super motivated. After 2–3 weeks, the topic just vanishes from my brain. Then I get disappointed, think I can’t change anyway, and often end up spending more again.

This  is always in the back of my mind. There’s this constant tension and I feel that I’ve lost control and I’m incapable to be a functioning person. 

What I’ve already tried/am doing:
Checked contracts & switched
Canceled all unnecessary subscriptions
YNAB but couldn’t find the right setup
paper budget book
Snowball method
Decluttered – still need to list stuff online
Deleted all delivery and taxi apps 

My questions:
How do you stay consistent with something like this long-term?
Any ADHD-friendly saving/budget tips?
What has helped you stick to similar projects?
Ideas to gamify this process?

I really want to pull this off but I need strategies that don’t rely only on discipline. I‘m greatfull for everything!

1mmed79,"Stop ""trying harder""","Wanted to share a realization I had recently about my ADHD that unlocked something for me. I've struggled with ADHD for years, and it took me way too long to understand that ""trying harder"" isn't a realistic solution to addressing my current issues and preventing future ones. For example, I once forgot to fill out an important form online because I got interrupted while filling it out, and remember thinking I'll remember this to get back to it, it's just a simple interruption and I can get right back to it. 30 minutes later, the thought was gone, and the form was never submitted. I kept telling myself that effort alone should solve the problem. But my brain isn’t necessarily wired to cooperate, despite my positive intentions.

Things finally changed when I realized that just ""trying harder"" was actually getting me nowhere. I kept convincing myself that if I pushed my willpower or tried a bit more, I'd finally get it right the next time. But that kept failing me—not because I wasn't trying, but because my ADHD brain requires a different approach altogether. It means I need different strategies, not just more effort. For example, I'm nearsighted, and I don't expect to have 20/20 vision by trying harder—instead, I got glasses. Likewise, with my ADHD, it’s about practical supports: reminders/alarms for everything, post-its all around to write everything down, environmental rearchitecting to help me.

I realize this might be an obvious mindset to others, and that I'm just slow to the party! But maybe if someone reading this catches themselves thinking, ""Why can't I just do this like everyone else? I'm trying so hard!"" – first of all, you're not alone. Be kinder to yourself. But also, maybe it's not about trying harder; maybe it's about trying differently. ",1754818929.0,78,6,ADHD,adhd
1mmx0a9,Denied diagnosis due to good grades?,"Preface (23M Army Lieutenant interaction with Army-employed Psychiatrist): I have been struggling with nearly every symptom of inattentive type as defined by the DSM for as long as I can remember. I've always been different, and I believe the high stress and expectations of my job are exacerbating symptoms. I could go on about how it negatively affects my life and job, but just know it does to a high enough degree that I went to seek a diagnosis.

In my first meeting with the psychiatrist, he asked about my high school and college GPA, which were above average because I'm a communication major. He asked to see any of my evaluation reports; I have none yet. He said that ADHD is diagnosed based on real-world effects, not internal thoughts or feelings, like depression would be diagnosed. Essentially, I could not provide enough concrete evidence that I suck, only word of mouth. HE pretty much just said I'm just an average overworked, overstressed, underslept officer. 

  
My question: I believe (if I'm not an impostor) that there are several real-world effects, but I guess they were not substantive enough to convince this Dr that I was the real deal. He also mentioned medication negatively affecting my career, which IDC about because I am doing enough of that on my own. Do any of you have experience with an army/military psychiatrist, and how did it go for you, regardless of whether you were diagnosed or not?

Prozac helped with my panic related bulimia… until i was later prescribed the adderall. as soon as the first pill metabolized in my body, i slowly slid from a pattern of *panic attacks, stressed eating, doomed pondering about how much i’m gonna gain* to a pattern of not eating at all because i either forgot, or just had to appetite. my views on my body and history of ED clearly contributed to this. i have never been “stick” skinny but as of now i am diagnosed as atypically anorexic. i’m not happy to be “unhealthy” but for some reason i feel so much cleaner and more comfortable and i kinda love this for me. i finally look good, feel comfortable, and am confident in my academics. i feel like i’m going the right way but something tells me that this feels wrong.

Then I became a ""janitor"" (maintenance) at a grocery store and although I'm always busy, I'm usually not on a short ""time-crunch"" all the time like I was working fast food. 

I'm worried about my future career and that if decide to major in something it could turn out horribly for me; I don't know how helpful job shadowing or anything like that would be since the shadowing could a be very different experience from what I do.

Just looking for any advice I can get on what my options are. Thanks in advance!",1754878574.0,2,3,ADHD,adhd
1mmjpuz,"A post related to hypersexuality, I guess... I don't know how to make a short title for this discussion.","19M. I know ADHD is said to have some overlap with hypersexuality, although I don't know the exact mechanics for that. Wanted to know if anyone else had this experience.

So, it's been well established that alot of us like climbing very much, right? I like climbing too. I always liked climbing buildings, poles, trees, windows, everything.

But, I would feel orgasmic sensations starting from the age of 4 or 5(I know I had this till 11, haven't done it after that) when:

- Climbing/climbing and holding on to poles.

- lying on your belly and sliding from a banister, then stopping the sliding down by using your legs and holding your position there using only legs as much as possible. It was a continuous feeling or orgasm for as long as I hold on to it. But I couldn't ejaculate (cuz I was 5 at best when I started doing it), but felt the need to and would forcefully try to pee and then go do it again. Then I would go sleep and often get these trippy dreams where I'm inside my balls or something the same flavour of weirdness. I know it's weird, but that's the kinda dreams I'd get after doing it.

The first time I masturbated, I was almost 13 and didn't start understand sexual attraction till that age. But I would touch myself even though I don't know how to do it and would do that pole/banister thing. I hit puberty late too, compared to my peers at the time.

I found out today that that's called polegasm/coregasm and I've only read women talk about till now.

Did y'all have the same or similar experiences of doing sexual stimulation type of things at a very young age?

I don't know if this post belongs here, but I felt like I might here similar stories from this sub...",1754835405.0,19,9,ADHD,adhd

1mlpdp8,I can’t believe I’m only NOW learning this.,"Apparently citrus fruits interact with adderall and inhibit its absorption due to citric acid. I’ve been on adderall for about three-and-a-half-ish years now and I only learned this TODAY. I’m a citrus FIEND and have been my entire life. Hell, I literally started growing a lemon tree last month after smuggling lemon seeds and volcanic ash into the United States in order to replicate the flavor of Sicilian lemons. But now I’m learning that my greatest joy in life is actively impacting my medication’s ability to do its job, and by extension impacting my ability to be a fucking academic weapon. I’m really not sure how to go forward now. My life is at a crossroads. I NEED my lemons, but I also need to go through with my collegiate education. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit: I didn’t actually smuggle any lemons into the United States, I’m well aware of the risks to the environment that come with bringing foreign agricultural goods into the US. I mostly just used the word ‘smuggle’ because it sounded funny. I made sure I did it fully legally.",1754745903.0,1639,282,ADHD,adhd

1mn4ary,need advice on working out,"i would really like to workout but it is so difficult to do it consistently. i keep wanting to do it everyday in the morning after waking up but that's just been impossible. im unable to do it in the evening cause there's always something or the other that comes up. also add a few tons of perfectionism to this and i realise if I can't do the entire routine or at that time, I am just unable to be flexible to continue. i really need to get into shape but nothing seems to working out and it's leaving me very paralysed. the workout I'm referring to is - bodyweight training in the house instead of hitting a gym cause it saves a lot of money and helps with more compound movements. 
i would really like some suggestions and tips. thanks in advance

1mmsyjm,ADHD Supplement/Dosage Help,"Hey everybody, I’m a 21M and have been on 10 mg XR Adderall for about a month now. I recently got into the gym and started eating healthier, and even at this lower dose I’ve noticed I’m more productive and better with time management. That said, I’m still struggling with tasks that require sustained attention — especially listening to lectures, where my mind wanders everywhere except the topic. Procrastination is still there too, but at a lower rate than before.

I have a follow-up appointment in a few days with my telehealth doctor, but they typically just ask if I want to increase my dosage rather than walking me through other options. I’m trying to figure out whether I should up the dose or try supplementing to support my focus.

Right now I take:

500 mg L-Tyrosine in the AM

200 mg Magnesium Glycinate at night

I’m also considering adding Omega-3, Vitamin D3 + K2, and/or B12.

Has anyone had success improving sustained attention with supplements alongside ADHD meds? Or should I just ask to increase my dosage? Any experiences, tips, or things to discuss with my doctor would be really appreciated.",1754857149.0,5,1,ADHD,adhd

1mmeogy,I Accidently Took my Meds Twice.,"My usual dose of concerta is 36 mg. I have an alarm to wake me up at 7 to take it but because I went to sleep late last night, I went straight back to bed after taking it. 

I woke up at 10 am forgetting it was the 2nd time I woke up. I took my meds again like it was autopilot. A few hours later I feel strangely fatigued and tactiely sensitive, I thought it was from the melatonin but this time It felt different.

An hour later I'm in my bed clenching my jaw and contracting every fibre of muscle in my body, for a second I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack. I measured my heart rate at 88 BPM but it feels like it's about to jump out of my chest. I feel paranoid and hyperalert. It feels like I'm controlling my body extra manually. 

Don't take your meds twice guys.

1mmi6o5,Any older/much older people on this sub with late life diagnosis of inattentive ADD?,"New member here. My husband (65+) was diagnosed 9 years ago with inattentive ADD. My first reaction was ""That explains everything!"" 😱 Unfortunately he could not tolerate any of the medication treatments and his symptoms/behaviors have worsened as he's gotten older- particularly lack of initiative/motivation and excessive daytime/waketime sleepiness. 

What brought me here in the first place was googling about metformin and effects/contraindications in ADD people. 
A 2 year old post asked if anyone had noticed symptom improvement while taking metformin or ozempic. 
The original post is archived but I wanted to reach out to people with the inattentive form of ADD in general for discussion as well as reopen the conversation about any symptom improvement for people taking metformin for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.
 Also like to hear from spouses of ADD people who like me are lurking on the sub. ",1754831419.0,15,18,ADHD,adhd

1mmv2g2,How do you manage loving a show or film a lot and then losing this feeling after a while?,"Hi! I am not sure if this a common symptom but i know a few, including me who has this ""habit"". Whenever i like a show, it turns into a ""special interest"" (i really don't like this word but whatever). I buy merch, keychains, hang with people who's been a fan, consume a lot of content about that show and all. 

I don't do this to every show obviously. But when i do it, it's really emotionally exhausting. I actually bond with it and believe that this bond will never loosen. But it loosens. And somewhere in my mind i know that the bond will loosen so i kinda get stuck in a ""i must not lose this show, i must make every moment watching it special"" loop. 

Because of this, i don't really rewatch things i like but recently made the mistake of rewatching a favorite show and it's been a heavenly hell. I keep falling in love with the show, buying keychains and believing this time i won't lose this feeling where in fact I KNOW this *love* will go away in a few weeks or so. Don't get me wrong i'll still like it but not revolve my world around. 

soo, how do you deal with this? how do you overcome how exhausting this feeling is? ",1754862260.0,3,6,ADHD,adhd
